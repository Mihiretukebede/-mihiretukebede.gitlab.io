My name is Mihiretu M Kebede. I was born in Gondar, Ethiopia. In 2006, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Medical Laboratory Technology at Addis Ababa University. After working for four years as a medical laboratory technologist, I did my MPH in Health Informatics at the University of Gondar in 2012. In 2015, I received a scholarship from the Basel Kanton to do advanced diploma in International Health at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel. After finishing my advanced diploma, I moved back to Gondar and continued working as a lecturer at the University of Gondar.

In April 2016, I came back to Europe and joined the University of Bremen. I received a doctoral research fellow position from the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology (BIPS) in the department of Prevention and Evaluation headed by Professor Dr.med Hajo Zeeb. 

In October 2019, I defended my Ph.D. entitled [*“Augmenting Diabetes Care and Self-management: What can digital health offer?”*](https://media.suub.uni-bremen.de/handle/elib/4307). During my time at the University of Bremen and while working at BIPS, I presented my research projects in several national and international diabetes and epidemiology conferences notably at the ADA, EASD, JBI, and DGEPI conferences. I have authored more than 30 journal articles published in several peer-reviewed international medical and public health journals.

Currently, I work in the division of Cancer Epidemiology at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. My current research focuses on mechanistic pathways linking obesity to changes in sex hormone profiles and ultimately leading to hormone-related cancers such as Breast, Ovarian and and endometrial cancer.
