In October 2019, he successfully defended his Ph.D. entitled “Augmenting Diabetes Care and Self-management: What can digital health offer?” During his time at the University of Bremen and while working at BIPS, he presented his papers in several national and international diabetes and epidemiology conferences notably the ADA, EASD, JBI, and DGEPI conferences. He authored more than 30 journal articles published in several peer-reviewed international medical and public health journals. In 2018, he received an award from Publons for being one of the top 1% Peer-reviewers in his field.

Mihiretu Kebede currently works in the division of Cancer Epidemiology at the German Cancer Research Centre in Heidelberg.

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots. See Figure \@ref(fig:pie) for example:

```{r pie, fig.cap='A fancy pie chart.', tidy=FALSE}
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
