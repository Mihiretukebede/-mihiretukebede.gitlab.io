abstract = {This paper presents the research landscape on microplastics and nanoplastics (M/NPs) in global food webs based on a bibliometric analysis of 330 publications published in 2009–2019 extracted from Web of Science. The publications increased tremendously since 2013. Marine Pollution Bulletin is one of the top productive journals for this topic. The publication landscape related to M/NPs in global food webs, as interdisciplinary research, is highly dependent on the funding availability. The high productivities of England, China, USA and European countries are attributed to the funding from the agencies at regional or national levels. Keyword analysis reveals the shift of research hotspots from investigations on M/NPs absorbed by various organisms in the ecosystems to studies on the trophic transfer of M/NPs and sorbed contaminants in the food webs and their associated adverse impacts. Funding agencies play important roles in leading the future development of this topic.},

abstract = {Laccase-based biosensors were successfully prepared using innovative, cheap, one-step Soft Plasma Polymerization technique by deposition of a bio-recognition layer on glassy carbon electrode and MWCNT (Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes)-modified glassy carbon electrode. The Soft Plasma Polymerization technique is based on corona discharge of cold atmospheric plasma with close to room temperature. The presented work includes study of biosensor working conditions, optimization of the voltage value applied for corona discharge generation as well as applicability and interference studies for dopamine determination. The biosensor constructed under optimal conditions (corona discharge generated at a voltage of 3 kV and in 30 s time deposition, helium flow rate 10 L/min, laccase solution flow rate 200 $\mu$L/min) has two linear ranges from 0.1 $\mu$mol/dm3 to 10 $\mu$mol/dm3 and from 10 $\mu$mol/dm3 to 50 $\mu$mol/dm3 with dopamine detection sensitivities of 3.63 $\mu$A*dm3/$\mu$mol and 1.33 $\mu$A*dm3/$\mu$mol. Application of the MWCNT interlayer allows the dopamine detection sensitivity to be significantly increased to 22.35 $\mu$A* dm3/$\mu$mol for a linear range from 0.1 $\mu$mol/dm3 to 6 $\mu$mol/dm3. Additionally, the studied biosensors have stable and anti-interference ability. Both biosensors were successfully applied for dopamine determination in pharmaceutical preparation.},

abstract = {Atmospheric pressure chemical ionizations (APCIs) of morphine, codeine, and thebaine were studied in a corona discharge ion source using ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) at temperature range of 100°C-200°C. Density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) and M062X/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory were used to interpret the experimental data. It was found that in the presence of H3 O+ as reactant ion (RI), ionization of morphine and codeine proceeds via both the protonation and carbocation formation, whereas thebaine participates only in protonation. Carbocation formation (fragmentation) was diminished with decrease in the temperature. At lower temperatures, proton-bound dimers of the compounds were also formed. Ammonia was used as a dopant to produce NH4+ as an alternative RI. In the presence of NH4+ , proton transfer from ammonium ion to morphine, codeine, and thebaine was the dominant mechanism of ionization. However, small amount of ammonium attachment was also observed. The theoretical calculations showed that nitrogen atom of the molecules is the most favorable proton acceptor site while the oxygen atoms participate in ammonium attachment. Furthermore, formation of the carbocations is because of the water elimination from the protonated forms of morphine and codeine.},

abstract = {Ultrafine particle behavior in electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) flow induced by corona discharge is studied experimentally and numerically. The EHD flow serves as a primary particle aspiration/sampling mechanism, the collector does not require any additional flow generation. Multiphysics numerical model couples the ion transport equation and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) to solve for the spatiotemporal distribution of electric field, charge density, and flow field, the results are compared with experimental velocity profiles at the exit. The computed velocity and flow rate data are in good agreement with the experimental data; the maximum velocity is located at the axis and ranges from 1 m/s to 4 m/s as a function of corona voltage. Experimentally evaluated particle transmission trends for ambient and NaCl nanoparticles particles in the 20 nm–150 nm range are in good agreement with the theoretical models. However, for particles in the 10 nm–20 nm size range, the transmission is lower due to the increased particle charging resulted from their exposure to the high-intensity electric field and high charge density in the EHD driven flow. These conditions yield a high probability of particles below 20 nm to acquire and hold a unit charge. The transmission is lower for smaller particle (10 nm) due to their high charge to mass ratio, and it increases as the single-charged particles grow in mass up to 20 nm, resulting in their lower electrical mobility. For particles larger than 20 nm, the electrical mobility increases again as they can acquire multiple charges. The results shed insight into interaction of nanoparticle and ions in high electrical field environment, that occur in primary EHD driven flows and in the secondary flows generated by corona discharge.},

abstract = {The whole world is locked down due to the outbreak of novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (nCOVID-19). A novel virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus pandemic 2019. Investigating the role of inflammatory mediators and understanding the virology of nCOVID-19 virus help in designing a rational and effective therapy for this infection. This review provides an overview of the inflammatory mediators activated during nCOVID-19 infection and the pathophysiology of this viral infection. In this review, the authors have a detailed discussion about the types of viral strains of nCOVID-19, its mechanism of action, host immune response, and the dysregulation caused by the viruses in the host immune system causing disease progression. Understanding the role of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and clinical immunology will be the approach to find out the possible novel therapeutic interventions. Therapies involving regulation of immune responses help in inhibiting the various steps in the pathologies of infection. Also, updated knowledge regarding the dysregulation of immune system and disease outcome in critically ill patients serves as a precautionary measure in the development and evaluation of vaccine. Impact statement: In late 2019, a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2, expanded globally from Wuhan, China and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the WHO. The mechanism of virus entry inside the host cell depends upon the cellular proteases including cathepsins, HAT, and TMPRSS2, which splits up the spike protein and causes further penetration. MERS coronavirus uses DPP4, while coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ ACE-2 as the key receptor. Cytokine storm syndrome was analyzed in critically ill nCOVID-19 patients and it is presented with high inflammatory mediators, systemic inflammation, and multiple organ failure. Among various inflammatory mediators, the level of interleukins (IL-2, IL-7, IL-10), G-CSF, MIP1A, MCP1, and TNF-$\alpha$ was reported to be higher in critically ill patients. Understanding this molecular mechanism of ILs, T cells, and dendritic cells will be helpful to design immunotherapy and novel drugs for the treatment of nCOVID-19 infection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW The use of nonpharmaceutical interventions can prevent viral spread in COVID-19 pandemic and PPE forms a crucial part of this strategy. However, there are discrepancies in existing guidelines and a lack of consensus among ophthalmic communities. This review aims to identify general consensus and provides recommendation of PPE for most common ophthalmological scenarios. With a global shortage of PPE, extended use and reuse strategies are also discussed. RECENT FINDINGS In this review, guidelines and resources were selected, based on a three-tier process. The first-tier resources were from international infection control organizations. The second-tier resources were from ophthalmological professional associations and colleges. The third-tier resources involved a PubMed search using the keywords 'COVID-19; coronavirus; personal protective equipment' performed on 1 May 2020. Non-English guidelines and literatures were excluded. SUMMARY On the basis of our methodology, we included a total of 30 documents, including 5 resources from tier 1, 14 resources from tier 2 and 15 from tier 3. Different levels of protection are necessary. Whenever performing an aerosol generating procedure, maximum protection should be ensured, this includes FFP3 respirator, fluid resistant gown, goggles or face-shield and disposable gloves. Similar protection should be used for handling COVID-19-positive/suspected case but the use of FFP2 respirator is acceptable. During routine outpatient clinic in cases of negative triage, it is recommended to use ASTM III surgical mask, plastic apron, disposable gloves and eye protection with goggles or face-shield. Lastly, patients should be encouraged to wear surgical masks whenever possible.},

Over a short span of time, the structures of therapeutic target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 were identified based on the homology modelled structure of similar SARS-CoV transmission of 2003. Since the onset of the disease, the research community has been looking for a potential drug lead. Out of all the known resolved structures related to SARS-CoV, Main protease (Mpro) is considered an attractive anti-viral drug target on the grounds of its role in viral replication and probable non-interactive competency to bind to any viral host protein. To the best of our knowledge, till date only one compound has been identified and tested in-vivo as a potent inhibitor of Mpro protein, addressed as N3 (PubChem Compound CID: 6323191) and is known to bind irreversibly to Mpro suppressing its activity. Using computational approach, we intend to identify a probable natural fungal metabolite to interact and inhibit Mpro. After screening various small molecules for molecular docking and dynamics simulation, we propose Pyranonigrin A, a secondary fungal metabolite to possess potent inhibitory potential against the Main protease (Mpro) expressed in SARS-CoV-2 virus.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus expresses many Microbial Surface Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules (MSCRAMM's) to recognize host extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules to initiate colonization. The MSCRAMM, fibronectin binding protein A (FnBPA), is an important adhesin for S. aureus infection. FnBPA also binds with fibrinogen (Fg) by using a unique ligand binding mechanism called dock, lock and latch. Nanoparticles, especially nanosilver particles have been widely used in a variety of biomedical applications which includes disease diagnosis and treatment, drug delivery and implanted medical device coating. In a biological system, when protein molecules encounter nanoparticle, they can be absorbed onto its surface which results in the formation of protein corona. In the present study, we have analysed the fibrinogen binding ability of rFnBPA(189-512) in the presence of silver nanoparticles by employing techniques like gel shift assay, Western blot, size exclusion chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, bio-layer interferometry and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results indicate that rFnBPA(189-512) is unable to bind to Fg in the presence of a nanoparticle. This could be due to the inaccessibility of the Fg binding site and conformational change in rFnBPA(189-512). With nanoparticles, rFnBPA(189-512) undergoes significant structural changes as the $\beta$-sheet content has drastically reduced to 10{\%} from the initial 60{\%} at higher concentration of the nanoparticle. Pathogenic bacteria interact with its surrounding environment through their surface molecules which includes MSCRAMMs. Therefore MSCRAMMs play an important role when bacteria encounter nanoparticles. The results of the present study suggest that the orientation of the protein during the absorption on the surface of a nanoparticle as well as the concentration of the nanoparticle, will dictate the function of the absorbed protein and in this case the Fg binding property of rFnBPA(189-512).},

Here we aimed at defining in-depth the clinical features and the neural correlates of the delusion. Ninety-six stroke patients in a sub-acute or chronic phase of the illness were assessed with a full ad-hoc protocol to evaluate the embodiment of an alien arm under different conditions. A sub-group of seventy-five hemiplegic patients was also evaluated for the embodiment of the movements of the alien arm. Fifty-five patients were studied to identify the neural bases of the delusion by means of voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping approach. Our results show that, in forty percent of the whole sample, simply viewing the alien arm triggered the delusion, but only if it was a real human arm and that was seen from a 1st person perspective in an anatomically-correct position. In the hemiplegic sub-group, the presence of the embodiment of the alien arm was always accompanied by the embodiment of its passive and active movements. Furthermore, the delusion was significantly associated to primary proprioceptive deficits and to damages of the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. To conclude, we show that the pathological embodiment of an alien arm is well-characterized by recurrent and specific features and might be explained as a disconnection deficit, mainly involving white matter tracts. The proposed exhaustive protocol can be successfully employed to assess stroke-induced disorders of body awareness, unveiling even their more undetectable or covert clinical forms.},

Now COVID-19 has been spread all over the world and declared epidemics by WHO. It has caused a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Due to the rapid increase of SARS-CoV-2 infections and unavailability of antiviral therapeutic agents, developing an effective SAR-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently required. SARS-CoV-2 which is genetically similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an enveloped, single and positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome comprising 29,891 nucleotides, which encode the 12 putative open reading frames responsible for the synthesis of viral structural and nonstructural proteins which are very similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV proteins. In this review we have summarized various vaccine candidates i.e., nucleotide, subunit and vector based as well as attenuated and inactivated forms, which have already been demonstrated their prophylactic efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, so these candidates could be used as a potential tool for the development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.},

abstract = {Purpose: In this study, we sought to develop a self-navigation strategy for improving the reconstruction of diffusion weighted 3D multishot echo planar imaging (EPI). We propose a method for extracting the phase correction information from the acquisition itself, eliminating the need for a 2D navigator, further accelerating the acquisition. Methods: In-vivo acquisitions at 3T with 0.9 mm and 1.5 mm isotropic resolutions were used to evaluate the performance of the self-navigation strategy. Sensitivity to motion was tested using a large difference in pitch position of the head. Using a multishell diffusion weighted acquisition, tractography results were obtained at (0.9 mm)3 to validate the quality with conventional acquisition. Results: The use of 3D multislab EPI with self-navigation enables 3D diffusion-weighted spin echo EPI acquisitions that have the same efficiency as 2D single-shot acquisition. For matched acquisition time the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between 3D and 2D acquisition is shown to be comparable for whole-brain coverage with (1.5 mm)3 resolution and for (0.9 mm)3 resolution the 3D acquisition has higher SNR than what can be obtained with 2D acquisitions using current state-of-art multiband techniques. The self-navigation technique was shown to be stable under inter-volume motion. In tractography analysis, the higher resolution afforded by our technique enabled clear delineation of the tapetum and posterior corona radiata. Conclusion: The proposed self-navigation approach utilized a self-consistent phase in 3D diffusion weighted acquisitions. Its efficiency and stability were demonstrated for a plurality of common acquisitions. The proposed self-navigation approach allows for faster acquisition of 3D multishot EPI desirable for large field of view and/or higher resolution.},

In the present study, commercial grade (50 nm) and chemically synthesized (40 nm) gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were aggregated at sub-zero temperatures, followed by disruption of the AuNP aggregates via nanosecond laser-ablation and subsequent effect on biological interactions. AuNPs were characterized pre/post laser-ablation via UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, etc. The process of freezing (aggregation) and laser-ablation (dispersion) was performed multiple times, in order to compare the yield of nanoparticles after each cycle of laser-ablation. Further, AuNPs pre/post laser-ablation were assessed for cytotoxicity, protein-corona formation, and cell-uptake by in vitro studies using RAW264.7, Caco-2 and Neuro-2 a cell lines. Aggregates for both the types of AuNPs displayed fragmentation following first cycle of laser-ablation. In addition, AuNPs obtained after fragmentation of the aggregates showed reduction in diameter and reshaping, as compared to native AuNPs. The size and shape of the nanoparticles after second and third cycle of laser-ablation was same as that obtained after first cycle of ablation. Both laser-ablated and native AuNPs showed similar effects on viability of RAW 264.7 and Caco-2 cells, after 24 h and 48 h of exposure. Cell uptake of native and laser-ablated AuNPs was observed to be a size dependent phenomenon. Present findings showed that nanosecond laser ablation of cryoaggregated AuNPs lead to changes in the physical properties of AuNPs post ablation like size and shape, however, biological interaction with cells remained same. This work is first report on biological interactions of AuNPs generated via laser-ablation of cryoaggregated AuNPs.},

abstract = {Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures suggest a widespread alteration of white matter (WM) microstructure in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The chronotherapeutic combination of repeated total sleep deprivation and morning light therapy (TSD+LT) can acutely reverse depressive symptoms in approximately 60{\%} of patients, and it has been confirmed as a model antidepressant treatment to investigate the neurobiological correlates of rapid antidepressant response. Methods: We tested if changes in DTI measures of WM microstructure could parallel antidepressant response in a sample of 44 patients with a major depressive episode in course of BD, treated with chronoterapeutics for one week. We used both a tract-wise and a voxel-wise approach for the whole-brain extraction of DTI measures of WM microstructure: axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean diffusivity (MD), and fractional anisotropy (FA). Results: Compared to baseline level, at one-week follow up we observed a significant increase in average FA measures paralleled by a significant decrease in MD measures of several WM tracts including cingulum, corpus callosum, corona radiata, cortico-spinal tract, internal capsule, fornix and uncinate fasciculus. The degree of change was associated to clinical response. Conclusions: This is the first study to show changes of individual DTI measures of WM microstructure in response to antidepressant treatment in BD. Our results add new evidence to warrant a role for chronotherapeutics as a first-line treatment for bipolar depression and contribute identifying generalizable neuroimaging-based biomarkers of antidepressant response.},

abstract = {Childhood maltreatment is associated with altered brain structure and function and is a major risk factor for psychopathology, including reactive attachment disorder (RAD). However, whether changes to white matter microstructural integrity are associated with RAD is unclear. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess group differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) in patients with RAD (n = 25; mean age = 13.2) to typically developing (TD) controls (n = 33; mean age = 13.0). To further interpret differences in FA, additional parameters such as mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity (RD) were assessed. We found that FA values in the body of corpus callosum (CC) and in the projection and thalamic pathways, including the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corona radiata (anterior, posterior, and superior), were significantly higher in the RAD than in the TD group. Additionally, RAD group showed significantly lower RD values in the body of the CC and abovementioned pathways than TD group. Our findings indicate that RAD is associated with altered structure of the CC and projection and thalamic pathways, which may play a role in emotion regulation. The aberrant development of these tracts in RAD may reflect stress-related psychophysiological responses.},

abstract = {The digestive tract is an important target organ for microplastics (MPs). However, little is known about the effects of digestive treatment on the intestinal toxicity of MPs. In this study, an in vitro digestive process was applied to transform 100 nm and 5 $\mu$m polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs). Intestinal toxicities of original PS-MPs and transformed PS-MPs (t-PS-MPs) were determined using an in vitro Caco-2 monolayer model. Results showed that the digestive process did not alter the chemical constitution of PS-MPs, but formed a corona on the surface of PS-MPs. The 100 nm PS-MPs showed higher intestinal toxicity than 5 $\mu$m PS-MPs. Digestive treatment relieved cytotoxicity and transport function disorder of the Caco-2 monolayer induced by the original PS-MPs. Moreover, the combined toxicities of PS-MPs and arsenic were also decreased by digestive treatment. However, the in vitro digestive process increased the proinflammatory effects of PS-MPs. The formation of a corona on the PS-MP surface, which lead to a change in size, Zeta potential, and adsorbed compounds, might induce the above influence of digestive treatment. Our study suggests that direct cytotoxicity assays of PS-MPs might misestimate their intestinal effects, which provide new lights to the toxicity evaluation of PS-MPs by oral exposure.},

abstract = {This work demonstrates the ability of aqueous phase corona discharge to chemically reduce bromate and chlorate ions, common disinfection byproducts, to bromide and chloride ions, respectively. A high voltage pulse was applied to a needle electrode, submerged in the target solution, to generate highly reactive oxidative and reductive species in a temperature-controlled reactor. Optimal water matrix conditions were sought through changing the solution pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration. Additionally, several oxidative species scavengers were investigated, including methanol, ethanol, sucrose, and D-sorbitol. Chemical reduction rates were improved at low pH (3.5). The presence of dissolved oxygen significantly reduced the chemical reduction rate, and thus high solution temperature (50 °C) also achieved better chemical reduction. All oxidative species scavengers improved the chemical reduction rate; however, methanol and ethanol were superior as these compounds generate hydrogen bubbles in the presence of plasma, which deoxygenates the solution further improving the chemical reduction rate. The application of this technology to 30 $\mu$M bromate and chlorate solutions, under optimal water matrix conditions and with the addition of 72 g/L-COD methanol, achieved greater than 95{\%} removal of the target compounds within 60 min. Increasing the initial concentration of the target compounds to 300 $\mu$M required 90 and 150 min to achieve similar chemical reductions for bromate and chlorate, respectively.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of both healthy and diseased tissues underscores its importance in human physiology. Previous studies suggest that HA can be used as a probe to qualitatively monitor cell surface levels of CD44 and other important HA receptors; however, these studies use mixtures of HA at various molecular weights. Using fluorescently labeled HA, we evaluated the apparent differences of low (25 kilodalton) and high (700 kilodalton) molecular weight HA interacting with breast cancer cell lines of varying levels of CD44. Our results confirm that CD44 expression and the apparent level of HA interaction correlates with molecular weight. Importantly, we show that HA only binds a small fraction of the major CD44 isoform, CD44S, on cell surfaces and that CD44S interactions account for {\textless}50{\%} of the total HA bound to cell surfaces. Although increased fluorescence level correlates with higher molecular weight of HA, this appears to be an artifact of chain length and not a result of multivalent binding between HA and CD44S. Accordingly, we verify that HA binding characteristics of cell surfaces is similar to previous artificial membrane models which proposed that HA anchors to CD44S and forms a non-binding corona of HA that extends beyond the surface.},

abstract = {In managing thalamic gliomas, total surgical removal is the most effective way of increasing overall survival. However, the thalamus is a difficult target because of surrounding neurovascular structures. According to the lesion's size/location/growth pattern, relation to neighboring structures, and surgeon's experience, most thalamic lesions can be reached through one of the 4 free surfaces: lateral ventricle, velar, cisternal, and third ventricle surfaces of the thalamus (3VsT).1-3 Approaching the thalamic lesions through the lateral side disrupts the integrity of internal capsule and corona radiata; thus, we never prefer this approach. For the removal of the lesions on the 3VsT, a transcallosal approach can be considered, but with this approach, we cannot reach 3VsT without harming the velar surface.  In this 3-dimensional video, we demonstrate an endoscope-assisted contralateral perimedian supracerebellar suprapineal (CPeSS) approach to a glioma on the 3VsT. The patient, a 49-yr-old man, had progressive dizziness for a month. With the patient in a semisitting position, total resection was achieved via the endoscope-assisted CPeSS approach. This approach is entirely transcisternal-transventricular and is a natural route to the 3VsT. Although the route is longer than the ipsilateral approach, it requires no retraction and provides more direct and wider visualization. It allows complete visualization of the lateral border of the lesion. A perimedian approach also avoids the major tentorial bridging veins, which are mostly at the midline. High-definition neuroendoscope was a great adjunct that helped to visualize residual tumors at hidden corners.  We suggest this approach for thalamic lesions on the third ventricle surface of the thalamus.  The patient consented to the publication of his images and a written consent was obtained.},

Despite smoking being listed as a risk factor to contract Covid-19, only a low proportion of the smokers suffered from SARS-corona infection in China 2003, and from Covid-19 in China, Europe and the US. We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO(2) concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO. Specialized iNO machines can now be developed to provide the drug intermittently in short bursts at high concentration dose, which would then provide both a preventative drug for those at high risk, as well as an effective treatment, without the health hazards associated with smoking.},

abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic has provoked drastic countermeasures including shutdowns of public services. We wanted to describe the effects of a 6 week shutdown of a large German botulinum toxin (BT) outpatient clinics on patients and their well-being. 45 patients (age 61.9 ± 9.8 years, 29 females, 16 males) receiving BT therapy (319.3 ± 201.9MU-equivalent, treatment duration 8.3 ± 5.5 years) were surveyed with a standardised questionnaire. The shutdown delayed BT therapy by 6.6 ± 2.3 weeks. 93{\%} of the patients noticed increased muscle cramps and 82{\%} increased pain reducing their quality of life by 40.2 ± 19.5{\%}. For 23 patients with cervical dystonia this reduction was 41.1 ± 18.3{\%}, for 3 patients with blepharospasm 33.3 ± 15.3{\%}, for 9 patients with spasticity 37.8 ± 15.6{\%}, for 4 patients with pain conditions 37.4 ± 35.7{\%} and for 3 patients with hemifacial spasm 27.5 ± 17.1{\%}. After the shutdown 66{\%} of patients perceived BT therapy as more important than before, 32{\%} perceived it as unchanged. For all patients long-term availability of BT therapy was very important or important. 98{\%} of the patients perceived the shutdown as inadequate and felt their patient rights not respected. The shutdown confirmed the considerable burden of disease caused by dystonia, spasticity, hemifacial spasm and various pain conditions and the importance of BT therapy to treat them. Any shutdown severely affects these patients and needs to be avoided.},

abstract = {The ionization source is the central system of analytical devices such as mass spectrometers or ion mobility spectrometers. In this study, a recently developed flexible microtube plasma (F$\mu$TP) is applied as an ionization source for a custom-made drift tube ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) for the first time. The FµTP is based on a highly miniaturized, robust and a small-footprint dielectric barrier discharge design with an outstanding ionization efficiency. In this study, the experimental setup of the FµTP was further improved upon to achieve optimal coupling conditions in terms of the ion mobility spectrometry sensitivity and the plasma gas consumption. One major focus of this study was the adjustment of the electrical operation parameters, in particular, the high voltage amplitude, frequency and duty cycle, in order to minimize the electric field disturbances and yield higher signals. Additionally, the consumption of helium plasma gas was reduced by refining the FµTP. It was found that the ionization efficiency could be significantly enhanced by increasing the plasma high voltage and through application of a duty cycle up to 90:10. Plasma gas flows could be reduced down to 3 mL min(-1) by increasing the plasma high voltage amplitude. Furthermore, a smaller wire electrode design enables the operation of the FµTP with nitrogen and clean air. Moreover, detection limits of a homologous series of ketones in the range of 330 ppt(v) (N(2)-FµTP, 2-decanone) down to 20 ppt(v) (He-FµTP, 2-octanone) could be reached in the optimized setup. To sum up, this feasibility study demonstrates the potential of the optimized FµTP as a powerful ionization source for ion mobility spectrometry especially with regard to ionization efficiency.},

The reasons for this should be sought in the processes of aging and chronic latent inflammation, i.e. immunosenescence and inflammaging. Laboratory medicine specialists are currently focused on proving the presence of the virus and defining biomarkers that would enable the prediction of disease progression. For now, it has been shown that useful biomarkers can include general biomarkers of inflammation (parameters of complete blood count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin), biomarkers of myocardial damage (high sensitivity troponin I/T, B-type natriuretic peptide, and N-terminal B type natriuretic peptide), and vascular biomarkers (D-dimer, prothrombin time, fibrinogen). Their actual diagnostic specificity, sensitivity and predictive value need to be tested on a larger number of subjects.

abstract = {The protein corona has served as a central dogma and a nuisance to the applications of nanomedicine and nanobiotechnology for well over a decade. Here we introduce the emerging field of amyloidosis inhibition, which aims to understand and harness the interfacial phenomena associated with a nanoparticle interacting with pathogenic amyloid proteins. Much of this interaction correlates with our understanding of the protein corona, and yet much differs, as elaborated for the first time in this Perspective. Specifically, we examine the in vitro, in silico and in vivo features of the new class of "amyloid protein corona", and discuss how the interactions with nanoparticles may halt the self-assembly of amyloid proteins. As amyloidosis is driven off pathway by the nanoparticles, the oligomeric and protofibrillar populations are suppressed to ameliorate their cytotoxicity. Furthermore, as amyloid proteins spread via the transport of bodily fluids or cross seeding, amyloidosis is inherently associated with dynamic proteins and ligands to evoke the immune system. Accordingly, we ponder the structural and medical implications of the amyloid protein corona in the presence of their stimulated cytokines. Understanding and exploiting the amyloid protein corona may facilitate the development of new theranostics against a range of debilitating amyloid diseases.},

abstract = {Self-assembly of proteins into well-organized proteinosomes has attracted great interest due to the potential medical and biological applications of the structures. Herein, a new concept of electrostatic assisted fabrication of proteinosomes is proposed. The self-assembly is performed by using multi-step dialysis approach, where negatively charged bovine serum albumin-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (BSA-PNIPAM) bioconjugate and positively charged enzyme (lysozyme or trypsin) are initially dissolved in phosphate buffer (PB) solution at a high salt concentration, and subsequently the protein solution is dialyzed against PB solutions at low salt concentrations, resulting in the formation of biofunctional proteinosomes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cryo-TEM and light scattering results all demonstrate the formation of hollow structures. The wall of a proteinosome is composed of BSA and enzyme (lysozyme or trypsin), and PNIPAM chains of the bioconjugate are in the corona stabilizing the structure. In comparison with the native enzymes, the enzyme molecules in the assemblies basically retain their bioactivities. The proteinosomes formed by BSA-PNIPAM and lysozyme can be dissociated in the presence of trypsin, and those self-assembled by BSA-PNIPAM and trypsin are able to be self-hydrolyzed, resulting in the dissociation of the structures in aqueous solution. The size and morphology changes of the proteinosomes in the hydrolysis are studied.},

abstract = {Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely serious infection with an extremely  high death rate worldwide. In March, the disease was declared a "global pandemic" by the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R (0) was less than one. Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations. It should be mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve is quite small.},

abstract = {The world-wide crisis of COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily lives, global  economies, intra/inter-countries political outlook and educational systems. Schools and colleges in India and abroad are under lock-down to maximize social distancing and minimize the spread of infection amongst students and teaching staff. Health sciences related universities and researchers are forced to adopt non-contact teaching and research. Present article highlights the positive impact and opportunities provided by COVID-19 crisis to health care research and academic set-up. We have compiled ethical, effective and practical guidelines to mitigate the impact on health care related research and academic front during these pandemic times in an Indian perspective. These guidelines and management suggestions can be modified to suit region based cases and can be applied in global perspective also. The suggestions in the current article provide a working collaboration of students and teachers to effectively connect on virtual platforms to strengthen their research output, giving suggestions of data-sharing and rapid review of proposals by online review ethical boards. This time is proposed to be used for generating a positive impact on health and research sector to use each adversity as an opportunity.},

abstract = {Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in early 2020 provides a rich data  source for exploring the ecological determinants of this new infection, which may be of relevance as the pandemic develops.Objectives: Assessing the spread of the COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and precipitation.Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25° latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6{\%}) contained at least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.Results: The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2{\%}) of cells, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from -28.0°C to 30.1°C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4°C to 23.0°C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm(-2) and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier conditions were associated with lower incidence.Conclusion: Though not demonstrating cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.},

@article{Barilla2020,
abstract = {: ACE2 receptor has a broad expression pattern in the cellular membrane and provides  a protective action against the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, this enzyme has become of extreme interest during the pandemic infection of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This virus invades alveolar epithelium and cardiomyocytes using ACE2 as a transmembrane receptor. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory peptide that degrades Ang II into Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating the biological effects of the AT1 receptor. The binding between the spike protein of COVID-19 and the enzyme is crucial for the virus to enter the target cells, but whether an increase in ACE2 activity could facilitate the infection is not yet demonstrated. However, this aspect has raised many concerns about the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in infected patients or patients at risk of infection. It appears that cellular infection leads to a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increase in the activity of the Ang II--AT1 axis, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, myocarditis, and hypercoagulability with the possibility of exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome, induction of pulmonary embolism, or appearance of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker drugs should be continued in infected patients, as their discontinuation can increase Ang II activity and induce injury to the lungs or cardiovascular system.},

abstract = {We formulate a deterministic epidemic model for the spread of Corona Virus Disease  (COVID-19). We have included asymptomatic, quarantine and isolation compartments in the model, as studies have stressed upon the importance of these population groups on the transmission of the disease. We calculate the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] and show that for [Formula: see text] the disease dies out and for [Formula: see text] the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we establish that [Formula: see text] is most sensitive to the rate of quarantine and isolation and that a high level of quarantine needs to be maintained as well as isolation to control the disease. Based on this we devise optimal quarantine and isolation strategies, noting that high levels need to be maintained during the early stages of the outbreak. Using data from the Wuhan outbreak, which has nearly run its course we estimate that [Formula: see text] which while in agreement with other estimates in the literature is on the lower side.},
