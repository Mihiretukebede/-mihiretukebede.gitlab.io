abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridizations using polynucleotide transcript probes (poly-FISH) usually exhibit a ring-shaped halo or corona-like fluorescence signal, whereas hybridizations with oligonucleotide probes (oligo-FISH) result in a uniform and evenly distributed fluorescence throughout the cell. The superiority of poly-FISH in comparison to oligo-FISH regarding the signal intensity and the detection of cells with a low ribosome content suggested a further investigation of the possibilities of polynucleotide probes. Poly-FISH has previously only been described for bacterial cells. In the present study it could also be successfully applied to several yeast species. In addition to that the properties of polynucleotide probes were analyzed by using varying probe lengths and concentrations. This led to the formulation of a hypothesis to explain the characteristic "halo" signal observed with polynucleotide probes. This "network hypothesis" suggests the formation of a network of probes based on the secondary structure of the single stranded RNA probes. Due to the limited permeability of the cell envelope, only part of the probe is linked to its intracellular target site, while the remaining part is located outside the cell and can form a network by hybridizing with single stranded probes, resulting in the ring-shaped fluorescence signal around the cell. The hypothesis was supported by a number of control experiments including in silico and in vitro analysis of the secondary structure of the probes and hybridizations with probes of defined secondary structures. The network concept provides a new basis for a wider application of poly-FISH.},

Poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(styrene)-b-1,2-poly(butadiene) (PEO-b-PS-b-PB) triblock copolymer "OSB" forms core-corona spherical micelles in aqueous solution, and the two hydrophobic blocks S and B are mixed homogeneously within the micelle core. PEO-b-PS-b-PB:C6F13I triblock copolymer "OSF" was prepared by selective fluorination of the B block in OSB with n-perfluorohexyl iodide. Fluorination of the B block induces internal segregation into an inner F core and an intermediate S shell. Furthermore, the strong incompatibility that results from fluorination drives a shape change into an oblate ellipsoid. These micellar morphologies are confirmed by combined light, neutron, and X-ray scattering measurements, as well as TEM imaging. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 American Chemical Society.},

Among these, piezoelectric polymer films with thicknesses between several tens and a few hundreds of micrometers as well as coaxial cables with piezoelectric polymer layers are highly suitable and attractive for the detection of mechanical loads. In addition to good piezoelectric properties, materials for such sensors should have high mechanical strength. Therefore, the most common materials are nonporous piezoelectric polymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or its copolymer with trifluoroethylene (P(VDF-TrFE)). Here, P(VDF-TrFE) polymer films as well as the operating principle and the geometry of piezoelectric polymer cables are described. As active piezoelectric cable layer, P(VDF-TrFE) (76/24) was employed. After electrical poling with one or more point-to-cable corona discharges, the polarization in the P(VDF-TrFE) layer was investigated. Poling parameters, such as electric field and poling time, were varied. The resulting polarization was characterized with measurements of polarization profiles across the film or the cable-layer thickness as well as with the determination of other electromechanical quantities. The optimized poling process yields good piezoelectric properties In the piezoelectric polymer layers as well as useful sensor properties of the piezoelectric polymer cable, which are assessed and discussed.},

They are mainly distributed in the ileum and appendix of animals and humans but their distribution in the cardiac glandular area has not been reported. A study of stomach histology in the Bactrian camel has revealed that the nodules are distributed as a band-like region along the ventral wall of the stomach neck, at the beginning of the cranial enlargement and on the lesser curvature. The mucous folds are thicker in these regions than where there are no aggregated lymphoid nodules. The nodules appeared similar to ileal aggregated lymphoid nodules found in other animals and consisted of typical polymorphological lymphatic nodules arranged in a single continuous row occupying the submucosa and forming mucosal folds together with the mucous membrane. The whole mucous membrane with cardiac glands, diffuse lymphatic tissue and solitary lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria were found to cover the aggregated lymphoid nodule regions, but some nodules with a typical corona extended into the lamina propria and were covered with follicle-associated epithelium devoid of cardiac glands.These findings indicate that the stomach of the Bactrian camel possesses not only a special structure of digestion but also has characteristic immunological morphology. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Beta emitting source wires or seeds have been adopted in clinical practice of intravascular brachy-therapy for coronary vessels. Due to the limitation of penetration depth, this type of source is normally not applicable to treat vessels with large diameter, e.g., peripheral vessel. In the effort to extend application of its beta source for peripheral vessels, Novoste has recently developed a new catheter-based system, the Corona™ 90Sr/90Y system. It is a source train of 6 cm length and is jacketed by a balloon. The existence of the balloon increases the penetration of the beta particles and maintains the source within a location away from the vessel wall. Using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo system, we have calculated the two-dimensional (2-D) dose rate distribution of the Corona™ system in water for a balloon diameter of 5 mm. The dose rates on the transverse axis obtained in this study are in good agreement with calibration results of the National Institute of Standards and Technology for the same system for balloon diameters of 5 and 8 mm. Features of the 2-D dose field were studied in detail. The dose parameters based on AAPM TG-60 protocol were derived. For a balloon diameter of 5 mm, the dose rate at the reference point (defined as r0 = 4.5 mm, 2 mm from the balloon surface) is found to be 0.010 28 Gy min-1 mCi-1. A new formalism for a better characterization of this long source is presented. Calculations were also performed for other balloon diameters. The dosimetry for this source is compared with a 192Ir source, commonly used for peripheral arteries. In conclusion, we have performed a detailed dosimetric characterization for a new beta source for peripheral vessels. Our study shows that, from dosimetric point of view, the Corona™ system can be used for the treatment of an artery with a large diameter, e.g., peripheral vessel. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.},

abstract = {Difficulty in foreskin retraction and phimosis are risk factors for penile carcinoma that may be related to the anatomically variable length of the foreskin. This observation has stimulated us to postulate the hypothesis that foreskin length is related to penile cancer. To compare the foreskin in the general population and patients with penile cancer, an anatomic classification of foreskin was designed. We examined the foreskin of 215 uncircumcised males without cancer (age range 15-93 years) and the foreskin of 23 patients with cancer (age range 31-90 years). Foreskin types were classified as long (with the preputial orifice located beyond glans meatus and entirely covering the glans), medium (with the preputial orifice located between meatus and glans corona), and short (with the preputial orifice located between corona and coronal sulcus). Phimosis was defined as a nonretractable prepuce of the long type. We found that 77{\%} of noncancer population cases had long foreskin and that only 7{\%} of these cases were phimotic. Cancer patients showed long foreskin in 78{\%} of the cases, and phimosis was significantly frequent in this group (52{\%}) as compared with the other (p {\textless}0.001). Coexistence of a long foreskin and phimosis may explain the high incidence of penile cancer in some geographic regions. To better document these findings, a comparison of foreskin types in countries with high and low incidence of penile cancer will be interesting. However, because phimosis appears to be a major factor, the presence of long foreskin may be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cancer development. For these reasons we support preventive circumcision in patients with long and phimotic foreskins living in high-risk areas. Cancers not related to long foreskins and phimosis may be causally different.},

abstract = {A mandatory step in performing micromanipulation techniques, studying sperm-oocyte interactions and evaluating morphological aspects of oocyte quality is the removal of cumulus cells from oocytes or zygotes at various stages. In cattle, cumulus removal shortly before fertilization invitro strongly decreases sperm penetration rates. This study was conducted to evaluate the function of the cumulus oophorus during bovine fertilization in vitro. The importance of cumulus secretions during IVF was investigated by inseminating cumulus-denuded oocytes (CDOs) in fertilization medium supplemented with individual cumulus secretions, such as progesterone or hyaluronic acid. None of these substances increased the fertilization rate of CDOs. However, fertilizing CDOs in cumulus-conditioned medium or on a cumulus monolayer partially restored the reduction in fertilization rate (P {\textless} 0.05). The fertilization rate of CDOs inseminated on a cumulus monolayer further increased when physical contact between the gametes and the monolayer was prevented by fertilizing them inside a culture plate insert placed on the monolayer (P {\textless} 0.05). Finally, the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and O2 concentration during IVF was studied. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence revealed a higher ROS load in conditioned medium of cumulus-enclosed oocytes (CEOs) than in that of CDOs after sperm-oocyte co-incubation (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, lowering the external O2 concentration from 20 to 5{\%} decreased the fertilization rate of both CEOs and CDOs, but had a higher impacton CEOs (P {\textless} 0.05). Inconclusion, this study provides evidence that the cumulus oophorus benefits the fertilizing ability of penetrating spermatozoa by creating a complex microenvironment of both cumulus secretions and metabolic products around the oocyte. Gap junctional communication between the oocyte and corona cells as well as sperm trapping by the cumulus oophorus seem to be essential factors in supporting fertilization. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

In order to accommodate lower flow rates in the range 1-10 $\mu$l/min, both sheath liquid and nebulizing gas were coaxially supplied to the nebulizer as an arrangement of pneumatically assisted electrospray interface. Since this paper focused on the primary study of the modified APCI interface, the performance of the interface was first evaluated by the direct infusion of a reserpine solution. Optimization of several APCI parameters, such as temperature of APCI vaporizer, nebulizing gas flow and APCI corona discharge current, were accomplished. The orifice dimension for the nebulizing gas flow was largely independent of the MS sensitivity when the nebulizing gas flow rate was ca. 0.4 l/min. A successful CE-APCI-MS separation is obtained using the modified APCI interface. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interaction between the spermatozoon and the zona pellucida during the first steps of fertilization was analysed on approximately 500 polyploid and unfertilized IVF oocytes by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Oocytes demonstrate high inter- and intra-individual variations in size and morphology which do not correlate either with the maturity of the oocytes or with the age of the women. During gamete interaction, corona radiata cells are widely dispersed around the zona but are still in contact with it through cytoplasmic filaments. Channels between granulosa cells guide spermatozoa towards the zona. In the course of fertilization, different types of attachment of the spermatozoon to the oocyte occur. Most commonly, a flat, tangential attachment of the sperm head to the surface of the zona appears, which is then followed by intrusion into the zona in precisely this horizontal position. However, vertical binding with penetration by the tip of the head first also occurs. In oocytes where large, cluster-like numbers of bound spermatozoa are visible, vertical binding and penetration is the most usual position. In the process of gamete interaction, both spermatozoa and zona pellucida are actively involved. Spermatozoa, including their tails, which are attached to the zona, are overgrown by filaments of zona material. These filaments of the zona are made of granules, which are the basic components of zona material. After the removal of the zona pellucida by laser, the oolemma becomes visible. It is covered by microvilli of highly variable numbers. Between these microvilli, cortical granules are evident, and appear even before sperm penetration.},

abstract = {Silicon amendments to hydroponic nutrient solutions have been used successfully in Canada to suppress powdery mildew (PM) caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea on cucumber (Cucumis sativus). In contrast, preliminary trials in Florida greenhouses failed to achieve the level of disease suppression reported in the literature for Canadian studies. A series of greenhouse experiments were conducted in Florida to determine the factors involved in reducing the effectiveness of silicon amendments for PM suppression on cucumber. Three horticultural practices (cultivar, nutrient solution formula, and rooting medium) and two environmental factors (light intensity and temperature) were tested in combination with silicon amendments for their effects on the suppression of PM on cucumber. When plants were irrigated with a standard nutrient solution amended with potassium silicate at 0 mg/liter, the cucumber cv. Vetomil was found to be resistant and cvs. Corona, Cilla, Farbio, and Toska were found to be susceptible to PM. Susceptible cultivars irrigated with potassium silicate at 100, 150, or 200 mg/liter exhibited a slight but statistically significant reduction in PM over the course of a 49-day trial. Although PM in the cultivar trial was slightly lower in treatments with added silicon, disease suppression with silicon was not commercially useful because it failed to increase fruit yields. Nutrient solution formula, rooting medium, and light intensity had no effects on the levels of PM suppression, regardless of whether plants were irrigated with potassium silicate at 0 or 100 mg/liter. Temperature was found to act in a synergistic manner with silicon. The greatest effect of temperature on PM suppression was observed at 20°C in which cucumber plants, irrigated with silicon at 100 mg/liter, exhibited significant reductions in the numbers of PM colonies per leaf. Disease suppression by silicon was observed at 25 and 30°C, but the magnitude of the disease suppression was significantly lower than when plants were maintained at 20°C. The effect of temperature on PM suppression by silicon may explain the difference in results between previous experiments in Canada, where greenhouse temperatures averaged 20 to 25°C, and the current study in Florida, where greenhouse temperatures averaged 24 to 32°C.},

abstract = {An 82-year-old man without notable medical history was admitted to our hospital following subacute deterioration of apettite, disorientation and strange behavior. There was spasticity of the right extremities without weakness. LDH and serum soluble IL2 receptor antibody levels were elevated, and as well as the protein level and IgG levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. CT scanning of the brain revealed a lesion at the left corona radiata. The patient's level of consciousness was worsening, and follow-up study of the brain showed a new lesion in the left occipital lobe. Intravascular lymphomatosis was therefore suspected. We performed a skin biopsy from two typical senile angiomas. In one of these biopsy specimens, a capillary hemangioma was present in the mid-reticular dermis and it was filled with abnormal B cells. The diagnosis of intravascular B cell lymphoma (IVL) was thus established. IVL is a rare subtype of extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma with a poor outcome. However, it is recently thought that if the diagnosis is established early, aggressive chemotherapy increases survival. Senile angioma is a skin eruption that is considered prevalent for the most part in elderly people. If a patient is suspected to have IVL, and there is no appropriate site of biopsy, it might be beneficial to try a skin biopsy aiming at senile angiomas for early diagnosis.},

abstract = {In this fourth of a series of papers that describe long-term cloud research at the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing at Salt Lake City, Utah, an approximately 10-year record of polarization lidar and photographic observations is analyzed to characterize the occurrence of optical displays in our local varieties of midlatitude cirrus clouds. The frequencies of occurrence of various types of halo, arc, and corona displays are evaluated according to their appearance and longevity over nominal 1-h observation periods and to the meteorological source of the cirrus. We find that complex halo-arc displays are rare at our locale and that even the so-called common 22 degree halo occurs infrequently as a complete long-lived ring. For example, only approximately 6{\%} of the 1561-h daytime cirrus periods have bright and prolonged 22 degree halos, although a total of 37.3{\%} have some indications of this halo, even if they are brief and fragmentary. Other fairly frequent features are the 22 degree upper tangent arc (8.6{\%}), 22 degree parhelia (8.5{\%}), and solar corona (7.2{\%}). Of the optical displays observed, 83.6{\%} are refraction based, only 1.9{\%} are due to reflection phenomena, and a surprising 15.4{\%} are caused by diffraction. Complex halo-arc displays are disproportionally associated with cirrus formed in tropical or subtropical airflow and also contain more horizontally oriented planar ice crystals. Lidar linear depolarization ratios from a subset of vivid displays show significant differences between halo- and the corona-producing cirrus, reflecting the effects of particle shape. Halos are associated with relatively warm cirrus that contain randomly and horizontally oriented planar ice crystals, whereas the colder corona cirrus produce much stronger depolarization from crystals too small to be uniformly oriented. Comparisons are made with available information from other locales, and we attempt to explain the geographical differences in terms of basic cirrus cloud processes.},

Because anomalous vessels in the retropubic region are at risk in groin or pelvic surgeries, they have an importance not only for general surgery but also for orthopaedics. Because it is hard to distinguish these vessels, they can be injured during ilioinguinal incision, which can lead to massive uncontrolled bleeding. For this purpose, 54 cadaver halves were dissected to determine the occurrence and location of the corona mortis anastomosis. We found venous corona mortis in 11 halves (20.37{\%}).

abstract = {Background: The recent development of a computer-assisted polarization microscopy system (Polscope) with which the meiotic spindle can be visualized in living oocytes on the basis of its birefringence permits analysis of the meiotic spindles of oocytes subjected to ICSI. Previous studies have shown that the meiotic spindle is not always aligned with the first polar body (PB) in metaphase II human oocytes prepared for ICSI. In the present study, the relationship between the degree of meiotic spindle deviation from the first PB location and ICSI outcome was analysed. Methods: Oocytes were divided into four groups according to the angle of meiotic spindle deviation from the PB position. The angle of deviation was 0-5°, 6-45°, 46-90° and {\textgreater}90° for groups I to IV respectively. Results: The rates of normal [2 pronuclei (PN)] and abnormal (1PN or {\textgreater}2PN) fertilization did not differ between groups I, II and III. However, the rate of normal fertilization was lower among oocytes in which the meiotic spindle deviation angle was {\textgreater}90°; this led to an increased proportion of tripronucleated zygotes that failed to extrude the second PB. When embryos developed from normally fertilized oocytes were evaluated on day 3 after ICSI, no relationship was found between the angle of meiotic spindle deviation and embryo quality. The meiotic spindle was not detected in only 9{\%} of oocytes, and these showed a higher incidence of fertilization and cleavage abnormalities than did oocytes in which the spindle was detected. When oocytes at metaphase I after cumulus oophorus and corona radiata removal were matured in vitro, the meiotic spindle was detected in 53.8{\%} of those that reached metaphase II. In these in-vitro-matured oocytes the meiotic spindle was always aligned with the first PB, suggesting that misalignment seen in those oocytes matured in vivo resulted from PB displacement during manipulations for cumulus and corona removal. Conclusion: High degrees of misalignment between the meiotic spindle and the first PB predict an increased risk of fertilization abnormalities. However, when normal fertilization had occurred, the cleavage potential of embryos developing from such oocytes was not impaired. These findings facilitate the selection of oocytes for ICSI in situations when the creation of supernumerary embryos is to be avoided.},

Helical MHD is relevant to the astrophysical flows such as in the solar corona, or the interstellar medium, and in the dynamo problem. The derivation involves the new writing of the general form of tensors for that case, for either vectors or (pseudo)axial vectors. It is shown that, for general third-order tensors, four generating functions are needed when taking into account the nonmirror invariance of helical fluids, instead of two as in the fully isotropic case. The new equation obtained, denoted by VKH-HM, links the dissipation of magnetic helicity to the third-order correlations involving combinations of the components of the velocity, the magnetic field, and the magnetic potential. Finally, in the long-time and nonresistive limit, this relationship leads to a linear scaling with separation of the third-order tensor, correlating the two normal components of the electromotive force and of the magnetic potential. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ultrastructure of rat thymus tissues with rat coronavirus (RCV) infection for clarifying the mechanism responsible for the morphological changes of the cells infected by RCV. METHODS: Routine electron microscopy was performed for observing RCV-infected rat thymus tissues. RESULTS: Following RCV infection, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pools of different dimensions were observed in the cytoplasm of the thymic epithelial reticular cells, merging subsequently with each other into larger ER lakes filled with particles of mature RCV, or viral inclusion bodies. After germination on the ER membrane, the viruses entered the matrix of the ER lake to mature and were eventually excreted to the extracellular space. The RCV particles were spherical in shape with a diameter of 100-130 nm and two distinct membranes, the outer one being the envelope and the inner one the nuclear capsid to enclose the viroplasm. Between the envelop and nuclear capsid was a electron-lucent middle layer comprising one to two thin membranous structures. Large quantity of short spike-like projections starting from the nucleus capsid penetrated the middle layer and the envelop to reach the glycoprotein coat and formed a corona-like structure. Mature RCV particles were distributed around the ER pools, cytoplasm, and intercellular space, and the RCVs in the endosome/lysosome were devoid of the envelop and nuclear capsid. CONCLUSION: The ER lakes are involved in the maturation of the viruses, and the envelop and nuclear capsid of the virus entering the cells from extracellular space are removed and degraded in the endosome/lysosome. Replications of virus occurs in plasma of the thymic epithelial reticular cells, and no RCV can be detected in the thymocytes.},

Furthermore, the PEG-ODN conjugate in the PIC micelle was stable against deoxyribonuclase (DNase I) digestion and has no interaction with the serum component because of the steric stabilization of the highly dense PEG corona surrounding the PIC core. These characteristics of the PIC micelles entrapping the PEG-ODN conjugate are promising for their utility as a novel ODN delivery system.},

abstract = {Chemical modification of the proteins bovine serum albumin, $\alpha$-lactalbumin, $\beta$-lactoglobulin and chicken lysozyme by 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3-HP) yielded compounds which exerted antiviral activity in vitro as compared with the native unmodified proteins. Of the three enveloped viruses tested, human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and porcine respiratory corona virus, only HSV-1 proved sensitive to the 3-HP-proteins. All of the chemically modified proteins presented antiviral activity against HSV-1 when assayed before, during or after infection. However, to achieve HSV-1 inhibition, significantly higher concentrations of the modified proteins were required if present before infection as compared to during or after infection. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of HSV-1 infection. Proteolytical digestion of albumin, $\alpha$-lactalbumin, $\beta$-lactoglobulin and lysozyme by trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin yielded several peptide fragments with antiherpetic activity. Chemical modification of these peptide fragments by 3-HP generated peptides with antiviral activity, however, this was almost always combined with a cytotoxic effect on the Vero cells. Overall, our results suggest that targeted chemical modification of some natural products might provide compounds effective against HSV-1 infection. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The number of baryons detected in the low-redshift (z {\textless} 1) Universe is far smaller than the number detected in corresponding volumes at higher redshifts. Simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe show that up to two-thirds of the 'missing' baryons may have escaped detection because of their high temperature and low density. One of the few ways to detect this matter directly is to look for its signature in the form of ultraviolet absorption lines in the spectra of background sources such as quasars. Here we show that the amplitude of the average velocity vector of 'high velocity' O VI (O5+) absorption clouds detected in a survey of ultraviolet emission from active galactic nuclei decreases significantly when the vector is transformed to the frames of the Galactic Standard of Rest and the Local Group of galaxies. At least 82 per cent of these absorbers are not associated with any 'high velocity' atomic hydrogen complex in our Galaxy, and are therefore likely to result from a primordial warm-hot intergalactic medium pervading an extended corona around the Milky Way or the Local Group. The total mass of baryons in this medium is estimated to be up to ∼1012 solar masses, which is of the order of the mass required to dynamically stabilize the Local Group.},

abstract = {New amphiphilic block copolymers based on oligomeric polyethylenimine and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PEI-PLGA) were synthesized by directly coupling PLGA with a carboxyl terminal group to PEI. The block copolymers were prepared by varying the length of the hydrophobic PLGA block (Mn=6, 10, and 21K), while that of the hydrophilic PEI block (Mn=423) was fixed. PEI-PLGA block copolymers were found to be self-assembled in water by using a PLGA segment as a hydrophobic aggregate block and a PEI segment as a hydrophilic corona-forming block. The block copolymers formed micelle-like aggregates with critical association concentration (cac) in the range of 1.54-2.57×10-3g/l in water. It was found that the size and cac of the aggregates depended on the hydrophobic block length and the ionic state of the PEI block. The aggregate size decreased and the cac increased, when the PLGA block length decreased and the PEI block was protonated. As a general program aimed at the development of a new nanoscopic drug carrier, the cellular uptake behavior of PEI-PLGA aggregates was compared with that of plain PLGA nanoparticles by using confocal microscopy. The results showed that PEI-PLGA aggregates was readily adsorbed onto the cell surfaces and translocated into the cytoplasm, implying their versatile applicability as a drug carrier. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Most reports of micrographia associated with focal brain lesions have related this finding to damage in the left basal ganglia. Here we describe the case of a 68-year-old man presenting with reversible micrographia accompanied by hypophonia in the absence of extrapyramidal signs after cerebral infarction in the left subcortical region. At the time of the patient's admission, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequence showed the lesion to principally involve the corona radiata, with some involvement of the putamen. Neurologically, mild right-sided brachiofacial hemiparesis and grasp reflexes - a frontal lobe sign - were observed. As his micrographia and hypophonia improved, the patient's grasp reflexes improved in parallel. In addition, recovery of regional cerebral blood flow in the left frontal lobe was confirmed by single photon emission computed tomography (technetium-99 m HMPAO). The present case suggests the possibility that the function of frontal-subcortical circuit might also be involved in the production and improvement of micrographia and that micrographia and hypophonia may share a common pathophysiology.},

abstract = {We study the junction between two solid objects, formed by polymer connectors which are supposed to freely explore the two grafting surfaces. We focus on the sphere-plane and sphere-sphere geometries. Because the chains are mobile, they are able to adapt both the local grafting density and their conformation to the position of the surfaces. Using a scaling approach, we show that, in chemical equilibrium, local grafting density is non-monotonic, and the junction can be divided into two different regions: the center, where connectors are compressed and exert a repulsive force between the objects (high excluded-volume interactions) and an external corona, where chains are stretched and attract the two objects. The relative importance of these regions varies for different separations and depends on surface geometries. When an external force is applied, this spatially inhomogeneous constraint exerted by the junction leads to specific force-distance profiles, which differ from profiles in the case of fixed connectors. An effective interaction potential and the adhesion energy are computed, showing a strong dependence on the geometry of surfaces.},

Among the morphologies observed, stripes are intrinsically fascinating and have potential for technological applications including nanolithography and nanoelectricity. Examples of materials featuring stripe patterns include Langmuir monolayers, magnetic films, lipid monolayers, liquid crystals and polymer films. Stripe formation is generally attributed to the competition between short-range attractive forces and long-range repulsion arising from dipole interactions. Here we show that stripe phases may result from a different mechanism based on a purely repulsive isotropic short-range pair potential with two characteristic length scales. We consider a two-dimensional (2D) assembly of particles consisting of a hard core surrounded by a soft corona and find that at densities where the hard-and-soft core radii compete with each other, decreasing the temperature induces a transition from a disordered state to an orientationally ordered phase characterized by stripe patterns.},

abstract = {One of the most intriguing aspects of mitosis is the ability of kinetochores to hold onto plus ends of microtubules that are actively gaining or losing tubulin subunits. Here, we show that CLASP1, a microtubule-associated protein, localizes preferentially near the plus ends of growing spindle microtubules and is also a component of a kinetochore region that we term the outer corona. A truncated form of CLASP1 lacking the kinetochore binding domain behaves as a dominant negative, leading to the formation of radial arrays of microtubule bundles that are highly resistant to depolymerization. Microinjection of CLASP1-specific antibodies suppresses microtubule dynamics at kinetochores and throughout the spindle, resulting in the formation of monopolar asters with chromosomes buried in the interior. Incubation with microtubule-stabilizing drugs rescues the kinetochore association with microtubule plus ends at the periphery of the asters. Our data suggest that CLASP1 is required at kinetochores for attached microtubules to exhibit normal dynamic behavior.},

To improve the removal efficiency of SO2 and NOx, ammonia (NH3) and propylene (C3H6) were used as chemical additives. It was observed that the pulsed corona induced plasma chemical process made significant NOx and SO2 conversion with reasonable electric power consumption. The ammonia injection was very effective in the enhancement of SO2 removal. NO removal efficiency was significantly improved by injecting a C3H6 additive. In the experiments, the removal efficiencies of SO2 and NOx were approximately 99 and 70{\%}, respectively. The specific energy consumption during the normal operation was approximately 1.4 Wh/m3, and the nanopulse conversion efficiency of 64.3{\%} was achieved with the pulsed corona induced plasma chemical process.},

abstract = {Surface properties of polymeric devices that are used to regenerate nervous damage are a point to be considered for axon regeneration in nerve system. In our previous studies, we prepared a wettability gradient on polyethylene (PE) surfaces using a corona discharge treatment from a knife-type electrode whose power increases gradually along the sample length. The PE surfaces were oxidized gradually with increasing power. The effect of surface wettability on the different types of cells has an important role for cell adhesion and proliferation. The purpose of this study is to investigate neurite formation on polymer surfaces with different wettability. Induction and growth of neurites from the rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells attached on the polymer surfaces with different hydrophilicity were investigated using the wettability gradient PE surfaces prepared by a corona discharge treatment. Neurites were investigated for number and length of neurites in terms of surface wettability. It was observed that neurite formation of PC-12 cells was increased more onto the positions with moderate hydrophilicity of the wettability gradient surface than onto the more hydrophobic or hydrophilic positions. From those results, it could be assumed that initial adhesion of PC-12 cells was caused by more calf serum (CS) protein than nerve growth factor (NGF), whereas the neurite formation of PC-12 cells was caused by more NGF than CS protein. It follows from what has been said thus far that PC-12 cells are a differentiated neuronal phenotype with a long neurite at around the position 2.5 cm (water contact angle of about 55 deg). In conclusion, surface wettability plays an important role for neurite formation on the polymer surfaces for axon regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor MRI provides unique directional diffusion information that can be used to estimate the patterns of white matter connectivity in the human brain. In this study, the behavior of an algorithm for white matter tractography is examined. The algorithm, called TEND, uses the entire diffusion tensor to deflect the estimated fiber trajectory. Simulations and imaging experiments on in vivo human brains were performed to investigate the behavior of the tractography algorithm. The simulations show that the deflection term is less sensitive than the major eigenvector to image noise. In the human brain imaging experiments, estimated tracts were generated in corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, fronto-occipital fasciculus, and uncinate fasciculus. This approach is promising for mapping the organizational patterns of white matter in the human brain as well as mapping the relationship between major fiber trajectories and the location and extent of brain lesions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Background: A sound knowledge of retropubic pelvic vascular anatomy is pivotal to the successful performance of endoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) inguinal hernioplasty. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the incidence and anatomy of iliopubic and aberrant obturator vessels. Methods: Between July 2001 and March 2002, a prospective endoscopic evaluation of retropubic vascular anatomy was performed on patients who underwent TEP. Endoscopic photographs of the vasculature over-lying the superior pubic ramus in the recruited patients were captured on a computer. Results: The retropubic vascular anatomy of 121 patients, who underwent either unilateral (n = 100) or bilateral (n = 21) TEP was examined. The iliopubic artery and vein were invariably present in every patient, and traversed along the iliopubic tract toward the pubic symphysis. The aberrant obturator artery was present in 31 pelvic halves, giving an overall incidence of 22{\%}. The aberrant obturator vein existed between the external iliac and obturator venous system in 27{\%} (n = 38) of the 141 pelvic halves examined. The overall incidence of corona mortis, in the form of either an aberrant obturator vein or artery, was 40{\%} (n = 56). Conclusions: Iliopubic vein and artery are universal findings in every patient. Both aberrant obturator artery and vein cross the superior pubic rami, and are therefore susceptible to injuries during dissection of the Bogros space and stapling of the mesh onto Cooper's ligament. Awareness of these aberrant vessels will help to reduce bleeding and subsequent morbidity. Tracing along the aberrant vessel can easily identify the obturator fora-men, which is an anatomic landmark that indicates an adequate inferior dissection of the preperitoneal space.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor MR imaging (DTI) provides information on diffusion anisotropy, which can be expressed with three-dimensional (3D) white matter tractography. We used 3D white matter tractography to show the corticospinal tract in eight patients with acute or early subacute ischaemic stroke involving the posterior limb of the internal capsule or corona radiata and to assess involvement of the tract. Infarcts and the tract were shown simultaneously, providing information on their spatial relationships. In five of the eight patients, 3D fibre tract maps showed the corticospinal tract in close proximity to the infarct but not to pass through it. All these patients recovered well, with maximum improvement from the lowest score on manual muscle testing (MMT) up to the full score through rehabilitation. In the other three patients the corticospinal tract was shown running through the infarct; reduction in MMT did not necessarily improve favourably or last longer, other than in one patient. As 3D white matter tractography can show spatial relationships between the corticospinal tract and an infarct, it might be helpful in prognosis of gross motor function.},

abstract = {We sought to determine the clinical pictures, topography and pathogenesis of patients with unilateral single or multiple corona radiata infarcts. We defined corona radiata ischemic stroke if the patient had a focal neurological deficit and a relevant non-hemorrhagic infarction confined to the vascular territory of a long medullary artery proved by CT and MRI with contrast. We compared risk factors and clinical feature between subtypes of corona radiata infarcts. The study sample represents 1,2{\%} of the patients (68/5500) with first-ever stroke in our Registry, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. There were 37 patients (54{\%}) with single infarct presenting 17 different complete or partial sensory-motor symptoms with dysarthria; 14 patients (21{\%}) with unilateral multiple infarcts in one hemisphere had oftenly complete sensorimotor deficits with some neuropsychological impairment; among 17 patients (25{\%}) with multiple infarcts in both hemisphere, one half had bilateral motor and sensory symptoms, and neuropsychological deficits, visual field defects were uncommon. Seventeen patients (25{\%}) had dysarthria, which was no localizing value. Hypertension was the most frequent vascular risk factor in 62{\%} of patients, smoking in 28{\%}, diabetes mellitus in 26{\%}, hypercholesterolemia in 9{\%}, and atrial fibrillation in 7{\%}. The main cause of corona radiata infarcts was small-artery disease with long-standing hypertension in 40 patients (59{\%}), large-artery disease in 19{\%}, cardioembolism in 12{\%}. Most of the patients (88{\%}) had leukoaraiosis, and patients with bilateral multiple infarcts, leukoaraiosis was more frequent than in those with unilateral single infarct (P = .016; {\textless} .05). Despite clinical similarity to that found in superficial and deep infarcts, incomplete motor and sensory symptoms and MRI allows to delineate simultaneous uni- or multiple infarcts in the corona radiata. After an acute and immediate onset, outcome at 6 months of stroke onset is in general benign except those with bilateral infarcts. The coexistence of small-artery disease with leukoaraiosis suggest similar vascular risk factors and physiopathological mechanism. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 by National Stroke Association.},

abstract = {Background: Although known as common causes of upper respiratory infections, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses are poorly studied as inducers of wheezing in infants, and their possible role in the development of childhood asthma has not been investigated. Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma. Methods: In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992-1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999. Results: Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33{\%}) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12{\%}), and coronaviruses in none. Rhinoviruses were present as single viral findings in 22 (81{\%}) of the 27 rhinovirus-positive cases, and rhinovirus infections were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy. Enteroviruses were commonly encountered in mixed infections and had no association with atopy. As single viral findings, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma (P = .047; odds ratio, 4.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.02-16.77 versus rhinovirus-negative cases [by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry)]. Conclusion: Our results present rhinoviruses as important inducers of wheezing even in infancy. The association with atopy and subsequent asthma calls for reevaluation of the role of rhinoviruses in the development of asthma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment-induced white matter (WM) injury in medulloblastoma survivors, as manifested by deterioration of cognitive function, is prevalent. However, no reliable imaging method exists for early detection and quantification. Our goal was to determine whether anisotropy of WM is reduced in medulloblastoma survivors and whether fractional anisotropy (FA) can be used as an index for evaluation of treatment-induced WM injury. METHODS: We evaluated nine medulloblastoma survivors treated with surgery, cranial irradiation, and chemotherapy by use of diffusion-tensor (DT) imaging and compared FA findings in selected WM sites (cerebellar hemispheres, pons, medulla oblongata, frontal periventricular WM, parietal periventricular WM, and corona radiata) with those of healthy age-matched control subjects. FA maps were compared with conventional T2-weighted images. FA was also compared with age at treatment, time interval since treatment, and deterioration of school performance. The two-tailed paired t test was used to determine statistical significance (P {\textless} .05). RESULTS: Significant reduction of FA (P {\textless} .05) was seen in all anatomic sites in the patient group compared with FA in control subjects, except in the frontal periventricular WM, even in areas with normal appearance on T2-weighted images. FA reduction ranged from 12.4-19{\%} (mean, 16.5{\%}). Compared with control subjects, posterior fossa and supratentorial WM FA in patients were reduced by 14.6{\%} (SD 1.9{\%}) and 18.4{\%} (SD 0.55{\%}), respectively (P = .029). Reduction of supratentorial WM FA correlated with younger age at treatment ({\textless} 5 years), longer interval since treatment ({\textgreater} 5 years), and deterioration of school performance. CONCLUSION: DT imaging and use of the index FA is potentially useful for early detection and monitoring of treatment-induced WM injury in children with medulloblastoma.},

The total current obtained with the negative corona discharge was about 100 times larger than that of IMS based on 63Ni, which results in a lower detection limit and a wider linear dynamic range. The detection limits for PETN, TNT and RDX were 8 × 10-11, 7 × 10-11 and 3 × 10-10 g, respectively. The calibration plots for these explosives showed linear dynamic ranges of about four orders of magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An antisense oligonucleotide (ODN), c-myb, was covalently conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) via an acid-cleavable phosphoramidate linkage to form a diblock copolymer-like structure. The phosphoramidate linkage between ODN and PEG was completely cleaved within 5 h in an endosomal acidic condition (pH 4.7). When complexed with a cationic fusogenic peptide, KALA, the ODN/PEG conjugate self-associated to form polyelectrolyte complex micelles in an aqueous solution. The anionic ODN segments were ionically interacted with cationic KALA peptide to form an inner polyelectrolyte complex core, while the PEG segments constituted a surrounding corona. Effective hydrodynamic volume of the micelles was ca. 70 nm with a very narrow size distribution. The polyelectrolyte complex micelles, composed of c-myb ODN-PEG conjugate and KALA, were transported into cells far more efficiently than c-myb ODN itself. They also exhibited higher antiproliferative activity against smooth muscle cells. This study demonstrates that the DNA/PEG hybrid micelles system can be applied for the delivery of antisense oligonucleotide.},

With ammonia doping at 2.39 mg m-3 in air and a water content of approximately 80 mg m-3 in the positive mode the observed response was attributable to the formation of [(H2O)nNH4]+ and [(H2O)n(NH3)NH4]+ in the reaction region. The observed responses in the negative mode were more complex with evidence for the formation [(H2O)nO2]-, [(H2O),nCO3]-, [(H2O)nHCO3]-, [(H2O)nCO4]- and [(H2O)nNO3]-. The responses due to these species were clearly discernible in the resultant mobility spectra, with enough oxygen-based species formed to support analytically useful responses.},

Unfertilized oocytes and gestation day 1 and 2 embryos were assessed morphologically, and the results suggested that absence or thinning of the zona pellucida (ZP) is related to infertility. However, the morphological characteristics of oocytes before ovulation and recovery from the effects of NAC were not clarified. In the present study, the ovarian follicles were histopathologically examined and the recovery of reproductive function was evaluated to investigate the effects of NAC. Female Sprague-Dawley rats at 10 weeks of age received NAC intravenously at 1000 mg/kg/day for more than 1 week. Thinning of the ZP was observed in the ovarian follicles in all stages of growth by light microscopy. Outflow of the components of the ZP between the corona radiata and disarrangement of the corona radiata were more pronounced in growing follicles than in large secondary follicles. Similar findings were observed by electron microscopy, and the effects of NAC were limited to the ZP. Infertility and thinning of the ZP were observed in the no-recovery NAC group, but not in the recovery NAC group, in which animals recovered within four estrous cycles after NAC administration. It has been reported that the ZP is expressed by oocytes or by both oocytes and granulosa cells, but no changes were noted in these cells. The present findings suggest that NAC affects the ZP directly and that reproductive function may recover from the effects of NAC.},

abstract = {Coronas are simulated in color by use of the Mie scattering theory of light by small droplets through clouds of finite optical thickness embedded in a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere. The primary factors that affect color, visibility, and number of rings of coronas are droplet size, width of the size distribution, and cloud optical thickness. The color sequence of coronas and iridescence varies when the droplet radius is smaller than approximately 6-microm. As radius increases to approximately 3.5 microm, new color bands appear at the center of the corona and fade as they move outward. As the radius continues to increase to approximately 6 microm, successively more inner rings become fixed in the manner described by classical diffraction theory, while outer rings continue their outward migration. Wave clouds or rippled cloud segments produce the brightest and most vivid multiple ringed coronas and iridescence because their integrated dropsize distributions along sunbeams are much narrower than in convective or stratiform clouds. The visibility of coronas and the appearance of the background sky vary with cloud optical depth tau. First the corona becomes visible as a white aureole in a blue sky when tau approximately 0.001. Color purity then rapidly increases to an almost flat maximum in the range 0.05 {\textless} or = tau {\textless} or = 0.5 and then decreases, so coronas are almost completely washed out by a bright gray background when tau {\textgreater} or = 4.},

abstract = {Particles dispersed in a liquid crystal above the nematic-isotropic phase transition are wetted by a surface-induced corona of paranematic order. Such coronas give rise to pronounced two-particle interactions. In this paper, we report details on the analytical and numerical study of these interactions published recently [Phys. Rev. Lett. [Formula presented] 3915 (2001)]. We especially demonstrate how for large particle separations the asymptotic form of a Yukawa potential arises. We show that the Yukawa potential is a surprisingly good description for the two-particle interactions down to distances of the order of the nematic coherence length. Based on this fact, we extend earlier studies on a temperature induced flocculation transition in electrostatically stabilized colloidal dispersions [Phys. Rev. E [Formula presented] 2831 (2000)]. We employ the Yukawa potential to establish a flocculation diagram for a much larger range of the electrostatic parameters, namely, the surface charge density and the Debye screening length. As a distinguished feature, a kinetically stabilized dispersion close to the nematic-isotropic phase transition is found. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Background: The technique of freezing oocytes is still not widely used. Reasons cited for this include the technique's low efficacy and the risk of aneuploidy. However, the introduction of technical changes (the type and concentration of cryoprotective substances; slow freezing and rapid thawing; and fertilization by ICSI) has led to improved results. We present four pregnancies obtained using mature oocytes (in metaphase II) that had been frozen and thawed. The oocytes were donated by young women who were not patients. Methods: The frozen oocytes (n = 88) came from seven donors aged 18-25 years. The metaphase II oocytes, morphologically normal in appearance, were denuded of their cumulus-corona complex. The cryoprotective freezing solution contained 1,2-propanediol (1.5 mol/l) and sucrose (0.3 mol/l). Freezing was slow and thawing rapid. The oocytes were fertilized by ICSI. Results: Seventy-nine of the 88 thawed oocytes survived (89.8{\%}); 58 were fertilized (73.4{\%} of all those microinjected); and 26 were transferred (44.8{\%} of all those fertilized). Four pregnancies were produced after seven transfers (57.1{\%}). Five children were born from four pregnancies. Conclusions: With the freezing/thawing technique used, oocyte survival was high (∼90{\%}). The pregnancy rate with frozen oocytes was similar to that obtained using fresh oocytes from donors (∼50{\%}).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether diffusion-tensor magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can depict abnormalities in patients with a diagnosis of developmental delay but structurally normal brain MR imaging results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty pediatric patients who received a diagnosis of developmental delay underwent brain MR examinations, including diffusiontensor MR imaging. The MR findings in these patients were compared with those in 10 age-matched neurodevelopmentally healthy children. Diffusion constant (Dav) and anisotropy were measured bilaterally in regions of interest in the centrum semiovale, corona radiata, internal capsule, corpus callosum, and subcortical white matter of the frontal and parieto-occipital lobes. By using a one-tailed Student t test in the positive direction for Dav and in the negative direction for anisotropy and P {\textless} .05 to indicate a significant difference, the Dav and anisotropy values for children with developmental delay were compared with those for children who were neurodevelopmentally healthy. RESULTS: The children with developmental delay had significant increases in Dav in all measured structures (P, {\textless}.001 to {\textless}.03). Significant decreases in anisotropy were detected in all white matter fiber tracts studied (P, {\textless}.001 to {\textless}.03) except the posterior limb of the internal capsule. CONCLUSION: In the children with developmental delay, diffusion-tensor MR imaging depicted decreases in anisotropy and increases in Dav in the white matter fiber tracts, which appeared to be normal at conventional MR imaging. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2003.},

abstract = {In contrast to IVF, in ICSI the surrounding cumulus and corona cells must be removed completely, as only denuded oocytes can be successfully manipulated by the holding pipette. This ancillary effect of ICSI allows us to focus on the morphology of preimplantation development from the earliest stages. Early prognosis regarding the developmental fate of oocytes would help to limit a negative impact of culture conditions. However, little evidence is available that non-invasive selection at the oocyte stage (first polar body, granular cytoplasm) may be of prognostic value. Recently, certain patterns of pronuclei (number and the distribution of nucleoli) at the zygote stage were found to correlate with treatment outcome in IVF and ICSI cycles, offering an additional prognostic tool prior to cleavage. As there is evidence that embryo selection on day 2 or 3 based on morphological criteria (fragmentation, number of blastomeres, multinucleation, uneven cleavage) may be imprecise, patients might benefit from extended embryo culture to day 5. However, not all major chromosomal aberrations are incompatible with blastocyst formation, and prolonged culture in vitro does not exclusively select embryos with a normal chromosomal complement. Consequently, special care should be taken to minimize the presence of aneuploid concepti in culture. In addition, multiple selection at different stages of development will be required to filter out the correct 'candidate' embryo which will result in a healthy newborn.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe the anatomical variations of the corona mortis, a vascular  anomaly that may lead to dangerous hemorrhage and possible death. CASE REPORT: A 46-year-old male cyclist was involved in a collision with a car, during which he sustained fractures to the left ribs and pelvic ring. Abdominal ultrasound imaging demonstrated a large (12x6x7 cm) nonhomogeneous mass ventral to the bladder, suggestive of a hematoma, which was confirmed on computed tomography. During angiography, 2 branches of the internal iliac artery were identified as sources of the bleeding; these were successfully embolized with microcoils, but the bleeding continued. Examination of the external iliac system found a lacerated aberrant obturator artery arising from the inferior epigastric branch of the external iliac artery, a condition known as the corona mortis. Additional embolization quelled the hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Coil embolization of the internal iliac artery branches is very effective in managing hemorrhage due to pelvic fractures, but variations in the origin of the obturator artery from the internal or external iliac artery may be additional sources of bleeding.},

In this invention a commercially available atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) chamber, employed without any corona discharge (no-discharge APCI), has been modified with the insertion of a gold surface, leading to a significant improvement in the ionization efficiency. The ionization of the sample takes place by both gas-phase and surface-activated processes. This new ionization source is able to generate ions with high molecular mass and low charge states, leading to improved sensitivity and reduced noise. The new device has been tested in the analysis of some peptides. A comparison between the performance with and without the presence of the surface, and the optimization of the operating conditions (nebulizing gas flow, sample solution flow, pH of solution, and surface area), are reported and discussed.

abstract = {It is well known that the morphology of block copolymer aggregates depends on polymer properties such as the molecular weight, the relative block length, and the chemical nature of the repeat unit. Recently, we have shown that if aggregates are allowed to self-assemble in solution, then in addition to the above factors, a high degree of control over the aggregate architecture can be achieved by adjusting the solution conditions. Factors such as the water content in the solvent mixture, the solvent nature and composition, the presence of additives (ions, surfactants, and homopolymer) and the polymer concentration were successfully employed to control the aggregate shape and size. In this paper, we review a series of studies performed in our group to show how solution properties can control architecture of aggregates prepared from a given copolymer. The control mechanism is explained in terms of the effect of each property on the forces that govern the formation of any given morphology, namely the core-chain stretching, corona-chain repulsion and interfacial tension.},

abstract = { In 2003, powdery mildew of greenhouse pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) was reported simultaneously in two commercial greenhouses at two separate locations near Langley in southern British Columbia. Trace amounts of mildew on the foliage of cv. Zamboni in one operation, and 10 to 80{\%} of the foliage of cv. Triple Four was affected in an organic operation, with losses in fruit yield of 2 to 4 kg/m2, were noted. The greenhouse pepper industry in British Columbia in 2001 comprised 76 ha with sales of {\$}41.3 million (Canadian). Affected areas appeared as a white, powdery coating on the abaxial leaf surface of older foliage while diffuse chlorotic spots were present at corresponding locations on the adaxial surface. In some cases, pale yellow spots appeared on the adaxial portion of the affected foliage during later stages of disease development (2). Hyaline, single-celled pyriform and cylindrical conidia were present in 40:60 proportion, respectively. Both conidia had a network of crests and granules sometimes with tiny thorn-like projections on the surface. These projections were evident also on the lower half of conidiophores. Pyriform conidia ranged in length from 53.8 to 79.5 \mum (mean = 68.0, SE = 0.8), and in width from 12.9 to 28.0 \mum (mean = 20.1, SE = 0.6, n = 50) with a mean length to width ratio of 3.5. Cylindrical conidia had a length from 48.2 to 84.0 \mum (mean = 66.0, SE = 0.9), and in width from 13.4 to 25.2 \mum (mean = 18.6, SE = 0.4, n = 50) with a mean length to width ratio of 3.6. Short conidial chains borne on conidiophores consisted of a basal pyriform conidium followed by cylindrical conidium. No cleistothecia were observed. Stomatal penetration and extensive endophytic mycelial growth in the mesophyll layer were evident in foliar tissue cleared with glacial acetic acid/EtOH (1:2) and stained with lactophenol cotton blue. To confirm pathogenicity, a suspension of 2 × 104 conidia/ml from infected pepper leaves was applied onto the abaxial and adaxial leaf surfaces of 60-, 42-, and 28-day-old greenhouse pepper cv. Cubico, tomato cv. Trust, and cucumber cv. Corona, respectively. Plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 25/21°C day/night temperature and 80{\%} relative humidity. Control plants in the same chamber were treated identically but not inoculated. After 21 days, inoculated pepper plants developed foliar powdery mildew symptoms on the abaxial surface, including sporulation similar to that of naturally infected plants. Occurrence of the fungus on the abaxial surface of pepper foliage, presence of endophytic mycelium, and the morphological characteristics of the imperfect state confirm the identity of the fungus (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Leveillula taurica (L{\'{e}}v.) G. Arnaud on pepper in British Columbia. The disease was first reported in Ontario, Canada in 1999 (1).

abstract = {Aim of the study: to evaluate the episodes of non-tubercular spondylodiskitis diagnosed between 1998 and 2002 at Ospedale S. Corona, Pietra Ligure (SV). Methods: prospective evaluation of vertebral osteomyelitis classified as spontaneous or iatrogenic if associated with procedures on the spinal cord, with detection of associated risk factors, localization, etiology and treatment. Results: 45 episodes, 71{\%} spontaneous and 29{\%} iatrogenic were observed. Associated risk factors were present in 47{\%} of spontaneous spondylodiskitis. Lumbosacral localization was detected in 68{\%} of spontaneous and 100{\%} of iatrogenic episodes. Other localizations in spontaneous spondylodiskitis were dorsal (25{\%}) or cervical (7{\%}). Methicillin-sensitive staphylococci caused the majority of spontaneous spondylodiskitis, while methicillin-resistant strains were more frequently involved in iatrogenic episodes. Among spontaneous spondylodiskitis, 63{\%} healed with antibiotics for 8 weeks, but surgery was often needed in dorsal localizations. In iatrogenic forms antibacterial therapy for 8 weeks-6 months was effective in cases not associated with foreign bodies but their presence always required surgery for healing. Conclusions: spondylodiskitis is more frequently localized at the lumbosacral level. Beta-lactams are generally effective in spontaneous episodes, while iatrogenic episodes often require associations of drugs. Surgery may be required in the case of dorsal localization or in the presence of foreign bodies.},

abstract = {Objective: Clinical classifications attempt to summarize a large amount of information in a few indices. CEAP is the most comprehensive and widely used classification of chronic venous disorders. The objective was to evaluate, in a routine clinical setting, the information associated with each CEAP clinical class and their ascending severity and additivity. Methods: This work was a multicenter evaluation of newly designed software dedicated to the management of venous diseases. Forty-nine angiologists from nine European countries entered a total of 872 full records of unselected patients. The data were analyzed to evaluate the informational value of each of the clinical classes and to test their ascending severity and additivity, with monovariate and multivariate statistical techniques with SPSS/PC software on the database of the 872 right lower limbs. Results: The series consisted of 700 women (80.3{\%}) and 172 men, aged 18 to 100 years (median, 53 years). The ascending severity of the classes was shown with the statistical association of higher severity C classes with the age of the patient, a history of previous deep vein thrombosis, the diameter class of the most dilated varicose vein, venous symptoms, and the presence of a corona phlebectatica. The additivity, as measured with the Cronbach $\alpha$ coefficient analysis, was satisfactory in highest classes but poorer within the first three classes, and factor analysis of correspondences showed the heterogeneity of the variables that make the classification. Conclusion: The information summarized with the CEAP clinical classes shows a good ascending severity but a poorer additivity. These limitations seem to be related to the heterogeneity of the information content, which suggests some refinements of this basic tool for clinical research in the field of chronic venous disorders.},

abstract = {This paper presents a report on the ionization/dissociation of some representative chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) induced by corona discharges in air at atmospheric pressure. Both positive and negative ions formed from Freons 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC 113a), 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane (CFC 113), and 1,1,1,2-tetrachlorodifluoroethane (CFC 112a) were analyzed using an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) instrument. Energy-resolved mass spectra were obtained by modulating the kinetic energy of the ions via adjustment of the sampling cone potential (Vcone). Positive ion spectra of the CFCs (M) at low Vcone show no signals due to either M+{\textperiodcentered} or MH+ but only those due to species [M - Cl]+ and CX3+ (X = Cl, F), likely formed via C-Cl and C-C bond cleavages following ionization via charge exchange. Charge localization in the products of C-C bond cleavage in M-{\textperiodcentered} is driven by the stability of the neutral fragment. At low Vcone the hydrates [M - Cl]+(H2O) are also observed. In the case of 1,1,2,-trichlorotrifluoroethane, [M - F]+ species also form as a result of ion-molecule reactions. As Vcone is increased collision-induced dissociation of [M - Cl]+ and [M - F]+, i.e., the perhalogenated cations C2X5+ (X = Cl, F), takes place via carbene elimination. In some cases such elimination is preceded or accompanied by rearrangements involving transfer of halogen from one carbon to the other. Evidence is also presented for the occurrence of a condensation reaction of C2Cl3F2+ with water to form a C2Cl2F2HO+ species via elimination of HCl. Negative ion spectra are dominated by Cl- and its ion-neutral complexes with M and with water. Additional components of the plasma include ion-neutral complexes O3-(M), the molecular anion M- (observed only with 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane), and an interesting species corresponding to [M - Cl + O]-. The origin and structure of these [M - Cl + O]- species are discussed in terms of available thermochemical and reactivity data and current mechanistic views concerning reaction of O2- with halogenated compounds. The observation of both positive and negative ions containing oxygen is of special relevance to development of new processes for the treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) based on oxidative decomposition induced by corona discharges in air at room temperature and pressure.

abstract = {Mechanisms of post-stroke recovery are still poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that cortical reorganisation in the unaffected hemisphere plays an important role. A 59 year old man developed a small lacunar infarct in the left corona radiata, which then caused marked deterioration in a pre-existing left hemiparesis that had resulted from an earlier right putaminal haemorrhage. Functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that the paretic left hand grip activated the ipsilateral left motor areas, but not the right hemispheric motor areas. This suggests that partial recovery of the left hemiparesis had been brought about by cortical reorganisation of the left hemisphere and intensification of the uncrossed corticospinal tract. The subsequent small infarct may have damaged the uncrossed tract, thereby causing the pre-existing hemiparesis to deteriorate even further.},

abstract = {The corona-like spikes or peplomers on the surface of the virion under electronic microscope are the most striking features of coronaviruses. The S (spike) protein is the largest structural protein, with 1,255 amino acids, in the viral genome. Its structure can be divided into three regions: a long N-terminal region in the exterior, a characteristic transmembrane (TM) region, and a short C-terminus in the interior of a virion. We detected fifteen substitutions of nucleotides by comparisons with the seventeen published SARS-CoV genome sequences, eight (53.3{\%}) of which are non-synonymous mutations leading to amino acid alternations with predicted physiochemical changes. The possible antigenic determinants of the S protein are predicted, and the result is confirmed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with synthesized peptides. Another profound finding is that three disulfide bonds are defined at the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the E (envelope) protein, based on the typical sequence and positions, thus establishing the structural connection with these two important structural proteins, if confirmed. Phylogenetic analysis reveals several conserved regions that might be potent drug targets.},
