METHODS: Artery blood gas analysis indexes were determined in 38 of 103 cases of SARS patients during acute stage, the relationship between the change of blood gas analysis index and prognosis of patients with SARS was analyzed. RESULTS: The lower partical pressure of carbon dioxide in artery (PaCO2), partical pressure of oxygen in artery (PaO2) in blood was, the higher death rate was. pH in blood had no significant influence on the prognosis of SARS patients. The prognosis of SARS patients were worse and the death rate was higher when patient had two or more acid-base disturbance. CONCLUSION: The artery blood gas analysis is useful for judging the conditions and prognosis of patients with SARS, and is beneficial for clinical treatment.},

abstract = {A Special "Fever and Cough" Clinic was set up at the Children's Hospital Affiliated to Capital Institute of Pediatrics for children with symptoms of fever and cough in late April when the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was at its peak in Beijing to separate the children with fever from others during their visit to the Outpatient Department. OBJECTIVE: For patients with fever, normal or low count of white blood cell and with suspected pneumonia suggested by X-ray, it was urgent to determine the etiological agents of the diseases before they were admitted to the hospital. METHODS: Throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens were collected from those patients and common respiratory virus antigens including influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types I, II, and III were tested by indirect immunofluorescent assay. The patients with atypical pneumonia diagnosed by X-ray and evidences of common respiratory virus infection were admitted to the regular ward for children with respiratory diseases. Children with pneumonia demonstrated by X-ray and negative for common respiratory viruses were admitted to the isolated ward for suspected SARS patients for the first step and further viral etiological studies were requested. RT-PCR was performed for those patients to detect gene fragments of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RhV) and enterovirus (EV) in their specimens. Nested RT-PCR was also developed to detect SARS coronavirus gene fragment from the specimens. Primer sequences for SARS virus detection with the PCR were selected according to the primer sequences published online by WHO on April 18, 2003. All the primers derived from the sequence at the 1b frame of coronavirus replicase gene and products with a size of 368 or 348 bp were expected with 2 different primer pairs. RESULTS: Amplicons with the sizes of 368 bp and 348 bp were obtained from a throat swab specimen collected from a 17 years old girl, who was admitted to the isolated ward because of high fever (39.5 degrees C) for 7 days, cough for 2 days, low WBC count, and pneumonia shown by X-ray when she visited the "Fever and Cough" Clinic, and without known history of contact with probable SARS patient. Antigens for the common respiratory viruses were all negative, RT-PCR for HMPV, RhV and EV were also negative while RT-PCR with different primer pairs for SARS virus were all positive which indicated that SARS coronavirus gene fragments were amplified from the specimen from this girl. The amplified fragment with a size of 368 bp was sequenced and the sequence was compared with those in the GenBank. The sequence shared 100{\%} homology with the sequences from 1b frame of replicase genes from all 17 of SARS coronaviruses published in the GenBank so far, and shared very low homology with 2 reference strains of human coronavirus as well as other animal coronaviruses. The serum collected before her discharge from the hospital (19 days after the onset of the disease) showed SARS specific IgM and IgG antibodies. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the patient was a confirmed case of SARS. It is of great importance to differentiate SARS patients from those infected with common respiratory viruses during SARS epidemic, especially for pediatric patients, because most of the patients visiting the outpatient department present with the symptoms of fever, cough and normal WBC count. The data mentioned above indicate that antigen and gene detections for those common respiratory viruses are useful methods for the differentiation to avoid the spread of SARS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Investigate the features of outbreak epidemic, clinical disease progression of the first SARS cases in Beijing and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic regimen. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (11 men and 18 women, 20 - 74 years old age range) were diagnosed with infectious SARS and admitted in our hospital from the March 5th to April 14th, 2003 in this study. The data of clinical presentation and disease progression of all the patients including index subject as the infectious SARS resource patient, her family infected members and 21 health care workers were abstracted. RESULTS: The first SARA outbreak in Beijing was characterized with the cluster feature of resource patient family members and health care providers. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 14 days. All the patients had a fever (temperature {\textgreater} 38 degrees C for over 24 hours) and other manifestations as reported before. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive pathologic air-space disease. Twenty patients showed the severe syndrome with various time ranged from 1 day to 14 days. Two patients died of progressive acute respiratory distress disease. The histologic analysis of one death patient showed diffuse alveolar damage in the two lungs. Twenty-six patients receiving the combined therapy including use of corticosteroid, antiviral ribavirin agents after the onset of symptoms and showed they had an acute self-limited disease course. The oldest patient (74 year old, male) received the healthy convalescent plasma infusion (50 ml) from recovered SARS subject and completely recovered within 21 days, having a shorter disease course. CONCLUSION: SARS is a kind of new self-limited and acute infectious disease. Early diagnosis, early isolation, early antiviral therapy for patients and efficient prevention for health care providers are urgently recommended. In particular, a combinational therapy of use of antiviral agents, preventive antibacterial antibiotics and pulsed dosage of corticosteroid can efficiently raise the clinical recovery rate and decrease mortality of SARS patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiologic agents of the SARS and develop diagnostic method for this disease. METHODS: Thirty-six nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from 27 patients with SARS in Shenzhen were collected. The samples were aliquotted to three parts and subjected to molecular assays for human metapneumovirus, chlamydia and a novel coronavirus, which was reported recently to be the etiologic agent of SARS. Nested RT-PCR was used to amplify the RNA polymerase gene of the novel coronavirus and the PCR products were sequenced directly or after cloned to pMD18-T vector. RESULTS: Human metapneumovirus and chlamydia genes were detected in none of the specimens using the RT-PCR and nested-PCR, respectively. The novel coronavirus gene were amplified in 6 of 36 specimens, the sequence analysis indicated that this novel coronavirus is unrelated to any other coronavirus reported previously. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid alignment between this coronavirus and others was not more than 40{\%} and 70{\%} to 82{\%}, respectively, while the nucleotide sequence cloned from the 6 patients were identical. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS patients in Shenzhen were infected with coronavirus and this novel coronavirus is associated with SARS. The sequence analysis indicated that the coronavirus from SARS patients in Shenzhen is the same as that identified from other areas such as Canada and Hong Kong. A specific diagnostic nested RT-PCR was developed to identify this novel coronavirus infection.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), now known to be caused by a coronavirus, probably originated in Guangdong province in southern China in late 2002. The first major outbreak occurred in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, between January and March 2003. This study reviews the clinical presentation, laboratory findings and response to four different treatment protocols. Case notes and laboratory findings were analysed and outcome measures were collected prospectively. The SARS outbreak in Guangdong province and the outbreak in Guangzhou associated with hospitals in the city are described, documenting clinical and laboratory features in a cohort of 190 patients randomly allocated to four treatment regimens. Patients were infected by close contact in either family or health-care settings, particularly following procedures likely to generate aerosols of respiratory secretions (e.g. administration of nebulized drugs and bronchoscopy). The earliest symptom was a high fever followed, in most patients, by dyspnoea, cough and myalgia, with 24 {\%} of patients complaining of diarrhoea. The most frequent chest X-ray changes were patchy consolidation with progression to bilateral bronchopneumonia over 5-10 days. Thirty-six cases developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of whom 11 died. There was no response to antibiotics. The best response (no deaths) was seen in the group of 60 patients receiving early high-dose steroids and nasal CPAP (continuous airway positive pressure) ventilation; the other three treatment groups had significant mortality. Cross-infection to medical and nursing staff was completely prevented in one hospital by rigid adherence to barrier precautions during contact with infected patients. The use of rapid case identification and quarantine has controlled the outbreak in Guangzhou, in which more than 350 patients have been infected. Early administration of high-dose steroids and CPAP ventilation appears to offer the best supportive treatment with a reduced mortality compared with other treatment regimens.},

After treatment, most lesions were absorbed completely, but slowly in patients with multi-lobe consolidation and/or extensive interstitial infiltration. CONCLUSION: Special clinical and imaging findings could be found in SARS cases. The prognosis of SARS patients is related to the degree of lesions detected by radiography and CT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To explore the pathological features and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to provide evidence for the clinical treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS: Pathological features of 2 cases of full autopsy and 4 cases of needle biopsy tissue samples from the patients who died from SARS were studied by light and electron microscopy. The distribution and quantity of lymphocyte subpopulations in the lungs and immune organs from SARS patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The location and semi-quantitative analysis of SARS coronavirus in the tissue specimens were studied by electron microscopy, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In total of 6 cases, diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar cell proliferation were common. The major pathological changes of 2 autopsy cases of SARS in lung tissues were acute pulmonary interstitial and alveolar exudative inflammation, and 2 autopsy and one biopsy lung tissues showed alveolar hyaline membrane formation. Terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamation of lung tissues in one autopsy and 2 biopsy cases were noted. Among 6 cases, 2 biopsy cases presented early pulmonary fibrosis and alveolar organization. Meanwhile, the immune organs, including lymph nodes and spleens from 2 autopsy cases of SARS whose disease courses were less than 12 days showed extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, reactive macrophage/histocyte proliferation, with relative depression of mononuclear and granulocytic clones in the bone marrows. However, spleen and bone marrow biopsy tissue samples from 4 dead SARS cases whose clinical course lasted from 21 to 40 days presented repairing changes. SARS coronaviruses were mainly identified in type I and II alveolar epithelia, macrophages, and endothelia; meanwhile, some renal tubular epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, mucosal and crypt epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tracts, parenchymal cells in adrenal glands, lymphocytes, testicular epithelial cells and Leydig's cells were also detected by electron microscopy combined with in situ hybridization. The semi-quantitative analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed that the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes were about 80{\%} of the total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium, with a few CD4+ lymphocytes CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ or CD20+ lymphocyte subpopulations were obviously decreased and there was imbalance in number and proportion, while CD57+, CD68+, S-100+ and HLA-DR+ cells were relatively increased in lymph nodes and spleens. CONCLUSIONS: Histologically, the pulmonary changes could be divided into acute inflammatory exudative, terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamative and proliferative repair stages or types during the pathological process of SARS. SARS coronavirus was found in multi-target cells in vivo, which means that SARS coronavirus might cause multi-organ damages which were predominant in lungs. There were varying degrees of decrease and imbalance in number and proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations in the immune organs of the patients with SARS. However, these changes may be reversible. It was found that cellular immune responses were predominant in the lungs of SARS cases, which might play an important role in getting rid of coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune mediated injury.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the early X-ray and CT findings of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Chest radiography and CT were performed in 28 patients with SARS within one to three days after onset of the disease. CT examinations included conventional spiral CT and high-resolution CT (HRCT). The radiographic and CT findings of these patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Abnormal CT findings were noted in all the patients, but abnormal chest radiographic findings in 17 cases (60.7{\%}, 17/28). CT showed single small focal patchy opacities in 23 patients (82.1{\%}, 23/28), including oval ground-glass opacities in 20 patients, lobular distribution ground-glass opacities in 2 and small patchy consolidation in one. Multi-focal ground-glass opacities were found in 2 patients and extensive opacities in three. In the 28 patients, a total of 31 lesions were found in the upper (7, 22.6{\%}), middle (3, 9.7{\%}), and lower lobes (21, 67.7{\%}). The diameter of the lesions ranged from 20 to 35 mm. CONCLUSION: The dominant feature of early SARS patients is focal patchy opacity in the lung, and oval small ground-glass opacities are the common morphological findings on CT.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 108 SARS in-patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 108 cases, 35 males (32.4{\%}) and 73 females (67.6{\%}), aged 37 +/- 9 (range 13 approximately 83 years), most were white-collar workers, medical workers accounting for 28.7{\%}. 87.0{\%} had a definite contact history. 20.4{\%} were complicated by other internal diseases. The main clinical manifestations included fever, cough, pectoralgia, chest distress, headache, etc. Involvement of multiple organs was often. The incubation period was 2 approximately 14 days. The course included early stage, progressive stage, climax, and convalescence. Mild type accounted for 4.6{\%}, common type 39.8{\%}, severe type 20.4{\%}, and extremely severe type 35.2{\%}. At the early stage, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count and ratio of lymphocyte, proalbumin, transferring, CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) cell count were remarkably decreased, and C-reactive protein, alpha-acid glycoprotein, and alpha(2)-globulin were remarkably increased. X-ray chest film showed solitary or multiple local exudative changes, mostly in pulmonary lower field. During the progressive stage the hyaline or consolidation images were enlarged. High solution CT showed solitary or multiple cotton wadding like images and ground glass-like or consolidation images. Hypoxemia was common. At the progressive stage application of adrenocortical hormones and non-invasive mechanical ventilation helped stop the progress of disease. Ninety-four cases were discharged, 14 cases died. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) regards SARS as one of epidemic febrile diseases. Treatment by combination of TCM and Western medicine was effective. CONCLUSION: SARS mainly affects youth and people in their prime of life. It has its own characteristic clinical manifestations. The classification system of 5 types and 4 stages helps judge the condition. Treatment by combination of TCM and Western medicine is encouraged.},

abstract = {In March 2003, SARS-CoV, a novel coronavirus which has been proved to be a pathogen causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The complete genome of SARS-CoV has been sequenced by international collaboration including China. In the present study, the genome sequences were collected from NCBI and genomic characterization was analyzed. SARS-CoV has a genome of 28-30 kb including 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames), which is consistent with that of coronavirus family, and its genome organization is similar to those of other coronaviruses as well. SARS-CoV evolutionally closes to other coronavirus in their corresponding proteins, such as spike protein, small membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein. In some regions of the genome, the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV was significantly different from that of other coronavirus, and has a self-conservative genomic sequence. Moreover, its encoding protein sequences were greatly different from those of other coronavirus. The analysis indicated that SARS-CoV has lower redundancy, that is, it has a high variation possibility. It may not be a variant of other coronaviruses but a novel coronavirus, which existed independently in nature and was not recognized by human being before, although SARS-CoV is morphologically similar to other coronavirus and belongs to coronavirus family. The sequences of its genes and encoding proteins are substantially different from those of other coronavirus.},

METHODS: Klenow-FragELTM DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit and immunohistochemical alkaline phosphatase detection reagent kit were used to detect cell apoptosis and expressions of CD68, CD20, CD4, CD8 and CD45RA in the pathological tissues of SARS patients. RESULTS: Apoptotic cells increased significantly in the spleen, lung and lymph nodes of SARS patients as compared with normal tissues. The apoptotic cells included pneumocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, and CD68+ monocytes were observed in abundance in the lung, spleen and lymph nodes of SARS patients. In the lung tissue of the patients, few CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells and CD4+/CD8+ T cells were spotted, and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells along with CD4+/CD8+ T cells were also significantly decreased in the spleen and lymph nodes, where few conserved B and T cells underwent apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Apoptosis is a general phenomenon in SARS, and the invasive cells in the pathological tissues are primarily monocytes, suggesting that apoptosis and invasion of monocyte play important roles in the progression of SARS. The cell apoptosis and decreased number of T cell and B cells in the lungs and CD4+/CD8+ T cells and CD20+/CD45RA+ B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes indicate that the SARS virus may exercise immune cell-killing effect to some extent during its pathogenesis.},

METHODS: Clinical data of 5 inpatients with SARS-complicated pregnancy in second and third trimesters from 4(th) February to 17(th) March 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Five patients were all primigravida (including 2 twins). Two were infected in second trimester while the other 3 in third trimester with 2 hospital-acquired infections and 3 community-acquired infections. All patients had fever (5/5), 3 chills or rigor, 4 cough; 2 with decreased lymphocyte, 2 decreased platelet, 3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 4 hypoalbuminemia, 5 abnormal chest radiographs. All 5 patients were cured with 1 requiring intensive care. 5 neonates including 1 twins have been followed up without evidence of SARS infections up to now. In a twin-pregnancy 1 fetus was lost while the pregnant's situation is stable. CONCLUSIONS: Common diagnostic criteria were Suitable for SARS-complicated pregnancy in second and third trimesters, but attention should be paid to the interaction between SARS and special pathological changes during pregnancy. Patients should be isolated and monitored intensively with timely cesarean section in severe cases, which could significantly decrease the maternal-perinatal mortality. The use of corticosteroids and psychological supports need further study.},

For this purpose, the incidence of micronuclei was evaluated by applying the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. Cytotoxicity was also investigated using the cytokinesis-block proliferation index. The experiments were performed on peripheral blood from 20 healthy donors, and several conditions were tested by varying the duration of exposure, the specific absorption rate (SAR), and the signal [continuous-wave (CW) or GSM (Global System of Mobile Communication) modulated signal]. The following exposures were carried out: (1) CW intermittent exposure (SAR = 1.6 W/kg) for 6 min followed by a 3-h pause (14 on/off cycles); (2) GSM signal, intermittent exposure as described in (1); (3) GSM signal, intermittent exposure as described in (1) 24 h before stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (8 on/off cycles); (4) GSM signal, intermittent exposure (SAR = 0.2 W/kg) 1 h per day for 3 days. The SARs were estimated numerically. No statistically significant differences were detected in any case in terms of either micronucleus frequency or cell cycle kinetics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since the outbreak of a highly contagious new pneumonia, atypical pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Guangzhou area, 33 children with this syndrome were treated in the authors' hospital. The present study aimed to understand clinical characteristics and prognosis of pediatric SARS patients in Guangzhou area. METHODS: Clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, therapeutic approaches and prognosis of the 33 children with SARS in Guangzhou area were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 33 cases, 17 were males and 16 were females. The age was between 3 months to 13 years, and 3 - 12 years old patients accounted for 82{\%}. Five (15{\%}) cases had an evident history of contacting SARS patient before the symptoms occurred. Another 5 (15{\%}) cases had a history that contacts of these patients (family members or friends) developed fever and/or cough later. The most common symptoms in this cohort were fever (100{\%}) and cough (91{\%}). Most of the cases had high fever, higher than 39 degrees C. Near half of the cases had nonproductive cough. The initial blood cells count showed that total white blood cell (WBC) count was (2.5 - 9.7) x 10(9)/L. In 22 (67{\%}) cases the WBC count was {\textless} 5.0 x 10(9)/L, and in 10 (30{\%}) WBC was (5.0 - 7.0) x 10(9)/L, in 18 cases most of the WBC were lymphocyte count. Chest radiograph showed patchy infiltrates, in 15 cases the changes were unilateral, and in 18 were bilateral. The radiologic changes developed fast, in some cases the changes progressed from one side to both sides. The opacity was absorbed slowly, significant absorption took in average two weeks. Elevated ALT was found in 3 cases and elevated CK-MB in 2 cases. Treatment included isolation, good ventilation of the ward, bed rest, supportive regimens, low volume oxygen inhalation, use of Chinese traditional medicine, antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, and anti-inflammation therapy. All the patients recovered and discharged from hospital after a mean period of 10.0 +/- 3.8 days. CONCLUSION: SARS in children may have its own characteristics. The main clinical manifestations were high fever and cough while no severe toxic symptoms, nor respiratory failure was seen; few symptoms or signs suggesting involvement of systems other than respiratory system were seen. Chest radiograph showed uni- or bilateral asymmetric air-space infiltrates which could worsen quickly and were absorbed slowly. Though there were severe changes in the lung, the patients might not have corresponding symptoms or signs. The total white blood cell count in peripheral blood did not increase. All the patients studied had a favorable outcome after the combined treatment.},

METHODS: Serial roentgenography and CT of 61 confirmed SARS patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The onset symptom was fever in all patients. In the early phase of SARS, the main abnormal appearance was single or bilateral localized patchy clouding opacity on roentgenography, which progressed rapidly. The area of opacity peaked at about 2 weeks, involving the majority area of the lung in 57{\%} of the patients. The area involved was correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms. The opacity disappeared gradually in 5 weeks in 84{\%} of the patients. Lungs complicated infection were found in 6 patients with a prolonged duration of the illness. Among the 61 patients, 4 died. CT scan was performed in 16 SARS patients in the recovery phase, of whom 13 showed lung fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Lung infiltration in early phase develops rapidly and involves most area of the lung in advanced phase in most SARS patients. Lungs fibrosis was found in some patients in the recovery phase.},

abstract = {The complete genomic nucleotide sequence (29.7kb) of a Hong Kong severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strain HK-39 is determined. Phylogenetic analysis of the genomic sequence reveals it to be a distinct member of the Coronaviridae family. 5' RACE assay confirms the presence of at least six subgenomic transcripts all containing the predicted intergenic sequences. Five open reading frames (ORFs), namely ORF1a, 1b, S, M, and N, are found to be homologues to other CoV members, and three more unknown ORFs (X1, X2, and X3) are unparalleled in all other known CoV species. Optimal alignment and computer analysis of the homologous ORFs has predicted the characteristic structural and functional domains on the putative genes. The overall nucleotides conservation of the homologous ORFs is low ({\textless}5{\%}) compared with other known CoVs, implying that HK-39 is a newly emergent SARS-CoV phylogenetically distant from other known members. SimPlot analysis supports this finding, and also suggests that this novel virus is not a product of a recent recombinant from any of the known characterized CoVs. Together, these results confirm that HK-39 is a novel and distinct member of the Coronaviridae family, with unknown origin. The completion of the genomic sequence of the virus will assist in tracing its origin.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to duration of illness. Cases that were 10 or fewer days in duration demonstrated acute phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases with a time course greater than 10 days showed organizing phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, TTF-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by RT-PCR in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue including the one negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies. Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insights into mechanisms of DAD.},

abstract = {AIM: To obtain the information of ligand-receptor binding between the S protein of SARS-CoV and CD13, identify the possible interacting domains or motifs related to binding sites, and provide clues for studying the functions of SARS proteins and designing anti-SARS drugs and vaccines. METHODS: On the basis of comparative genomics, the homology search, phylogenetic analyses, and multi-sequence alignment were used to predict CD13 related interacting domains and binding sites in the S protein of SARS-CoV. Molecular modeling and docking simulation methods were employed to address the interaction feature between CD13 and S protein of SARS-CoV in validating the bioinformatics predictions. RESULTS: Possible binding sites in the SARS-CoV S protein to CD13 have been mapped out by using bioinformatics analysis tools. The binding for one protein-protein interaction pair (D757-R761 motif of the SARS-CoV S protein to P585-A653 domain of CD13) has been simulated by molecular modeling and docking simulation methods. CONCLUSION: CD13 may be a possible receptor of the SARS-CoV S protein, which may be associated with the SARS infection. This study also provides a possible strategy for mapping the possible binding receptors of the proteins in a genome.},

Using a novel approach (combining electrophysiological and morphological techniques), we examined the structures of the typical slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (SARs) located in the lung periphery. We recorded SAR activities in the cervical vagus nerve, identified the receptive field, dissected the SARs in blocks, fixed and processed these blocks for immunohistochemical staining using anti-Na+/K+-ATPase, and examined the blocks under a confocal microscope. These SAR structures have multiple endings that have terminal knobs. Some structures that are located in the airway walls have terminal knobs buried in smooth muscle. Others are in the most peripheral part of the lung, and their terminal knobs have no obvious relation to smooth muscle, suggesting that muscle contraction may not be a direct factor for SAR activation.},

Thus, to develop and expression protein fragment from spike protein gene are the purposes of this experiment. Partial spike gene fragments (751-1925 bp, 2005-3410 bp, 1-1925 bp and 32-3659 bp) and its intact gene were cloned into pET32 or pGEX vectors, and transformed into competent Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (pLysS), respectively. 63, 78, 98, 160 and 164 kD fusion proteins were successfully expressed with amounts of 35{\%}, 34{\%}, 24{\%}, 17{\%} and 5{\%} of total cell protein. The soluble parts of the cell crude extract were then partially purified by GST affinity chromatography.},

abstract = {The purposes of the present studies were to examine the androgen receptor (AR) binding ability and in vitro functional activity of multiple series of nonsteroidal compounds derived from known antiandrogen pharmacophores and to investigate the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of these nonsteroidal compounds. The AR binding properties of sixty-five nonsteroidal compounds were assessed by a radioligand competitive binding assay with the use of cytosolic AR prepared from rat prostates. The AR agonist and antagonist activities of high-affinity ligands were determined by the ability of the ligand to regulate AR-mediated transcriptional activation in cultured CV-1 cells, using a cotransfection assay. Nonsteroidal compounds with diverse structural features demonstrated a wide range of binding affinity for the AR. Ten compounds, mainly from the bicalutamide-related series, showed a binding affinity superior to the structural pharmacophore from which they were derived. Several SARs regarding nonsteroidal AR binding were revealed from the binding data, including stereoisomeric conformation, steric effect, and electronic effect. The functional activity of high-affinity ligands ranged from antagonist to full agonist for the AR. Several structural features were found to be determinative of agonist and antagonist activities. The nonsteroidal AR agonists identified from the present studies provided a pool of candidates for further development of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) for androgen therapy. Also, these studies uncovered or confirmed numerous important SARs governing AR binding and functional properties by nonsteroidal molecules, which would be valuable in the future structural optimization of SARMs.},

METHODS: Subsets of blood T lymphocyte in 93 patients with SARS were detected by flow cytometer. The patients comprised 40 men and 53 women, aged 17 - 88 years (average 44 years). The results detected in 64 normal subjects and 50 patients with AIDS served as controls. RESULTS: The numbers of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes all significantly decreased in acute phase of SARS patients compared with those in normal persons. Their findings was different from what we observed in patients with AIDS who had decreased CD(4)(+), but increased CD(8)(+) counts. The counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes decreased more apparently in patients with critical SARS. All the five patients who died had CD(4)(+) counts less than 200/microl. As the patients' conditions improved, the counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) gradually returned to normal. CONCLUSION: The patients with SARS were found having damage of cellular immunity markedly.},

Three major lessons were learned as a result of the SARS epidemic in 2003, involving communication, evidence-based action and global partnerships. It is proposed that a series of broadband global response networks should be developed. At a technical level the networks are essentially in place, such as the Internet2 global network. Suitable peripheral devices also exist.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of glucocorticosteroids on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and chest X ray changes after discontinuation of glucocorticosteroids treatment. METHODS: To retrospectively study the clinical characteristics of 5 cases with SARS and chest X ray changes after discontinuation of glucocorticosteroids. RESULTS: 5 cases were medical workers and had exposure to SARS patients. The incubation periods were 2 to 7 days. They had high fever from the onset of the disease. There were lung infiltrates 1 to 6 days after fever and then methylprednisolone was given to them. Two or three days after glucocorticosteroids treatment, clinical symptoms in these patients were disappeared. The clinical symptoms in case 1, cases 2, case 4 and case 5 weren't deteriorated after discontinuation of methylprednisolone while the presentation in chest X ray was progressed 3-6 days later. No more methylprednisolone was given to the patients and the infiltrates in chest X ray was gradually absorbed in 5-11 days. The temperature in case 3 was elevated again and the shadow in chest X ray was progressed after discontinuation of methylprednisolone due to the low dosage of glucocorticosteroids. When the dosage of methylprednisolone was increased, the temperature tended to be normal and the lung infiltrates began to absorb gradually. CONCLUSION: For the patients with non-severe SARS, if the symptoms were disappeared after discontinuation of glucocorticosteroids, the lung shadow may be progressed. we can closely observe the condition of the disease and no more glucocortisteroids needed to be given to the patients. The lung shadow could be absorbed gradually.},

This report summarizes the hematological findings in SARS patients and proposes a hypothesis for the pathophysiology of SARS coronavirus related abnormal hematopoiesis. Hematological changes in patients with SARS were common and included lymphopenia (68{\%} - 90{\%} of adults; 100{\%} of children, n = 10), thrombocytopenia (20{\%} - 45{\%} of adults, 50{\%} of children), and leukopenia (20{\%} - 34{\%} of adults, 70{\%} of children). The possible mechanisms of this coronavirus on blood system may include (1) directly infect blood cells and bone marrow stromal cells via CD13 or CD66a; and/or (2) induce auto-antibodies and immune complexes to damage these cells. In addition, lung damage in SARS patients may also play a role on inducing thrombocytopenia by (1) increasing the consumption of platelets/megakaryocytes; and/or (2) reducing the production of platelets in the lungs. Since the most common hematological changes in SARS patients were lymphopenia and immunodeficiency. We postulate that hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, by mobilizing endogenous blood stem cells and endogenous cytokines, could become a hematological treatment for SARS patients, which may enhance the immune system against these virus.},

METHODS: RT-PCR was performed using SARS coronavirus-specific primers to amplify the polymerase gene fragment of SARS-associated coronavirus from specimens of suspected and established SARS cases. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. All the obtained sequences were compared with the sequence of published SARS-associated coronavirus, and alignment was proceeded with other coronavirus sequences. RESULTS: Specific amplicons can be amplified from the sputum samples, throat swab and plasma of most SARS patients, and 8 were random selected and sequenced. All of them possessed 100{\%} homology with the published SARS-associated coronavirus sequence, while all the negative controls were RT-PCR negative. Nucleotide-sequence and amino acid-sequence alignment of the fragment BNI109 with other six known coronavirus show that the fragment BNI109 is more close to bovine coronavirus(BCV) and murine hepatitis virus(MHV). The BNI109 fragment showed 75{\%} homology with BCV and MHV at amino acid level. CONCLUSION: The polymerase fragment BNI109 of SARS coronavirus is highly conservative and is suitable for detecting SARS-associated coronavirus using RT-PCR method.},

abstract = {The R (replicase) protein is the uniquely defined non-structural protein (NSP) responsible for RNA replication, mutation rate or fidelity, regulation of transcription in coronaviruses and many other ssRNA viruses. Based on our complete genome sequences of four isolates (BJ01-BJ04) of SARS-CoV from Beijing, China, we analyzed the structure and predicted functions of the R protein in comparison with 13 other isolates of SARS-CoV and 6 other coronaviruses. The entire ORF (open-reading frame) encodes for two major enzyme activities, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and proteinase activities. The R polyprotein undergoes a complex proteolytic process to produce 15 function-related peptides. A hydrophobic domain (HOD) and a hydrophilic domain (HID) are newly identified within NSP1. The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets. Findings suggest that it is possible to obtain information about the phylogeny of SARS-CoV, as well as potential tools for drug design, genotyping and diagnostics of SARS.},

abstract = {Annotation of the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) is indispensable to understand its evolution and pathogenesis. We have performed a full annotation of the SARS-CoV genome sequences by using annotation programs publicly available or developed by ourselves. Totally, 21 open reading frames (ORFs) of genes or putative uncharacterized proteins (PUPs) were predicted. Seven PUPs had not been reported previously, and two of them were predicted to contain transmembrane regions. Eight ORFs partially overlapped with or embedded into those of known genes, revealing that the SARS-CoV genome is a small and compact one with overlapped coding regions. The most striking discovery is that an ORF locates on the minus strand. We have also annotated non-coding regions and identified the transcription regulating sequences (TRS) in the intergenic regions. The analysis of TRS supports the minus strand extending transcription mechanism of coronavirus. The SNP analysis of different isolates reveals that mutations of the sequences do not affect the prediction results of ORFs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To primarily investigate the changing mode of anti-SARS coronavirus IgG antibody in clinically diagnosed SARS patients and the possibility of subclinical infection in physicians and nurses through close association with SARS patients. METHODS: The plasma levels of anti-SARS coronavirus IgG antibody of 57 normal subjects, 127 physicians and nurses worked in SARS wards for one month and 73 SARS patients with different course of SARS were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Plasma anti-SARS coronavirus IgG antibody was not detected in normal subjects and the clinical personnel. After 0-7 days, 8-10 days, 11-14 days, 15-20 days of onset of disease, the positive rates were 0.33{\%}, 52{\%}, 86{\%} respectively, and the general positive rate was 61{\%}. CONCLUSION: The specificity and sensitivity of ELISA to detect plasma anti-SARS IgG antibody were satisfactory. Cases with positive reaction could be diagnosed as patients already infected by the virus. The specific IgG antibody didn't emerge in some patients in the early stage of the disease, and the negative results didn't indicate that they were not infected. And follow-up investigation should be made in those patients. Unlike common epidemic infectious diseases, SARS probably hadn't the potentiality of subclinical infection.},

abstract = {AIM: To constructed a three-dimensional (3D) model for the 3C like (3CL) proteinase of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and to design inhibitors of the 3CL proteinase based on the 3D model. METHODS: Bioinformatics analyses were performed to search the homologous proteins of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase from the GenBank and PDB database. A 3D model of the proteinase was constructed by using homology modeling technique. Targeting to the 3D model and its X-ray crystal structure of the main proteinase (Mpro) of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), virtual screening was performed employing molecular docking method to identify possible 3CL proteinase inhibitors from small molecular databases. RESULTS: Sequence alignment indicated that the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was extremely homologous to TGEV Mpro, especially the substrate-binding pocket (active site). Accordingly, a 3D model for the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase was constructed based on the crystal structure of TGEV Mpro. The 3D model adopts a similar fold of the TGEV Mpro, its structure and binding pocket feature are almost as same as that of TGEV Mpro. The tested virtual screening indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the MDDR database might dock into both the binding pockets of the TGEV Mpro and the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase. CONCLUSIONS: Either the 3D model of the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase or the X-ray crystal structure of the TGEV Mpro may be used as a starting point for design anti-SARS drugs. Screening the known proteinase inhibitors may be an appreciated shortcut to discover anti-SARS drugs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the transmission process of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to evaluate the infectiveness of SARS patients in different periods of disease epidemics. METHODS: Standardized questionnaire was used to conduct case investigation and contact tracing by combining the field investigation and telephone interview. Transmission process, infectivity, transmission chain and contact history of SARS were studied through data analyses. RESULTS: On 25th March 2003, a 91 year old man was admitted to Hospital J in Beijing with stroke and fever. He died on 30th March. From 31st March, there was an outbreak of SARS among his contacts in the family and in the hospital he was admitted to. Contacts would include his relatives, other co-patients and health care workers in the Hospital J. Chinese Field Epidemiology Training Program trainees conducted an investigation of the outbreak. Among the 207 contacts of the index cases through different generations, there were 36 cases of SARS (attack rate 17{\%}) patients with one death. There were 12 cases having directly contact with the index case and 13 cases with one secondary case. The transmission chains of this outbreak could clearly be depicted. All the cases had close contacts during the symptomatic period of their index patients. Among the relatives, 85{\%} of the cases had 3 - 5-day contact with their index patients after the onset of the illnesses. There was no significant difference between the two attack rates-70{\%} for whose who had contact with the patient before and after illness onset) and 67{\%} for those who only had contact after the onset of the illness. Out of the 44 social acquaintances and 38 of the family members who had contacts with the index patients during the incubation period, no one was found ill. Among the close contacts at the hospital who had no protection when providing care to the patient, the attack rate was found over 80{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: All the secondary cases of this outbreak had a history of direct and close contacts to the index patients after the onset of the illness. There was no evidence indicating that SARS cases were infectious during their incubation period.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the mechanism of strong inflammatory response in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHODS: 24 patients managed with a standard corticosteroid protocol developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital were followed up for 2 months and their clinical outcomes were documented. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were determined by quantitative ELISA during the course of disease respectively. 12 healthy blood donors were used as normal controls. RESULTS: All SARS patients had remarkably increased plasma IL-8 concentrations (median 31.23 ng/L) at the onset of disease compared with those of normal controls (6.28 ng/L, P {\textless} 0.01). Along with the course of disease IL-8 concentration kept going up and 75{\%} (18/24) patients reached a peak median concentration of 149.65 ng/L (P {\textless} 0.01) at the third and fourth weeks. IL-8 came back to normal control levels one month after discharged from hospital. Meanwhile, SARS patients also showed high a TNF alpha level (median 23.12 ng/L) (P {\textless} 0.01) at the second week and reached a peak median of 136.35 ng/L (P {\textless} 0.05) at the third an fourth weeks. One month after discharged from hospital the plasma TNF alpha concentration fell down to a median of 94.88 ng/L, but it was still much higher than normal controls (3.77 ng/L, P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSION: The SARS-associated coronovirus infection may cause complex cytokine cascade. IL-8 and TNF alpha probably play important roles in mediating strong inflammatory response, which are thought to be responsible for lung injury in SARS patients.},

METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with SARS referred to the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases (GIRD), China from December 22, 2002 to March 2003 were studied retrospectively. The data reviewed included those of clinical manifestations, laboratory investigation and roentgenology. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 42 men and 36 women, aged 20 - 75 years (mean 37.5 +/- 11.6 years), including 44 infected health-care professionals. Clinical symptoms of these patients were fever (100{\%}), coughing (88{\%}), and dyspnea (80{\%}). Routine blood test revealed WBCs {\textless}4.0 x 10(9)/L in 12 patients (15{\%}), (4.0 -10.0) x 10(9)/L in 49 (63{\%}), and over 10.0 x 10(9)/L in 17 (22{\%}) [average (7.6 +/- 5.0) x 10(9)/L]. The level of neutrophilic granulocyte was 0.75 +/- 0.13 and that of lymphocyte was 0.18 +/- 0.11. Chest X-ray and CT scanning revealed changes related to pneumonia. The transmission of the disease was likely via close contact with contagious droplets. The prevalences of acute lung injury (ALI,37 patients) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 21 of the 37 patients) were considerably high among the patients. Seven patients who developed ARDS complicated with MODS died. CONCLUSIONS: A history of close contact, fever, X-ray signs of pneumonia and normal or lowered WBC counts are favorable for the diagnosis of SARS. Recognition of ALI as the important index for critical SARS and comprehensive supportive management are of paramount importance in decreasing the mortality of patients with SARS.},

There were 12 cases (15.3{\%}) with WBCs {\textless} 4.0 x 10(9) /L, 49 cases (62.8{\%}) ranging between (4.0 -10.0) x 10(9) /L and 17 cases (21.8{\%}) over 10.0 x 10(9) /L. The average was (7.58 +/- 4.96) x 10(9) /L, with 0.75 +/- 0.14 (neutrophil) and 0.18 +/- 0.11 (lymphocyte). Chest films and CT scanning revealed changes related to pneumonia. The transmission of the disease was likely via close contact with contagious droplets. The prevalences of acute lung injury (ALI, in 37 cases) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, 21 out of 37 cases) were considerably high among the patients. Seven patients who developed ARDS complicated with multiple organs dysfunction syndrome (MODS) died. CONCLUSIONS: A history of close contact, fever, sign of pneumonia by X-ray and normal-to-lowered WBC counts are favorable for the diagnosis of SARS. Recognition of ALI as the important index for critical SARS and comprehensive supportive management are of paramount in decreasing the mortality of the disease.},

METHODS: The primers and the fluorescence-labeled probe were designed and synthesized according to the published sequence of the SARS-associated coronavirus genes. A F-PCR diagnosis kit for detecting the coronavirus was developed, and 115 clinical nasopharyngeal gargling liquid samples were tested. RESULTS: The sequence of PCR amplified products completely matched the related sequence of the SARS-associated coronavirus genome. Forty-nine out of 67 samples from identified SARS patients and 8 of 18 samples from persons having close contact with SARS patients showed positive results. All 30 samples from healthy controls were negative. CONCLUSION: The F-PCR method established may be a rapid, accurate and efficient way for screening and for the early diagnosis of SARS patients.},

METHODS: Clinical data in this cohort were collected prospectively as they were identified. RESULTS: The outbreak started with a SARS patient from the community on 30 January 2003, followed by a total of 96 people [76 women and 20 men; mean age (29.5 +/- 10.3) years; 93.8{\%} of whom were health care workers] infected in a short period of time after their exposure to this source patient. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 20 days, with a mean of (5.9 +/- 3.5) days. The initial temperature was (38.3 +/- 0.6) degrees C, while the highest was (39.2 +/- 0.6) degrees C (P {\textless} 0.001), with a mean fever duration of (9.0 +/- 4.2) days. Other common symptoms included fatigue, cough, mild sputum production, chills, headache, general malaise and myalgia. The radiographic changes were predominantly bilateral and in the middle or lower lung zones. Leukopenia was observed in 67.7{\%} of this cohort. The mean lowest oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1){\%} with supplementary oxygen through a nasal cannula. 68.8{\%} of the patients were treated with methylprednisolone for a mean period l of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. Ninety-five patients (99.0{\%}) had a complete clinical recovery, and 1 patient died of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mean hospitalized duration was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. CONCLUSION: SARS appears to be highly contagious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression. Corticosteroids, antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although used empirically, might be of some benefits in shortening the clinical course.},

Clinical data in this cohort were collected prospectively as they were identified. RESULTS: (1) The incubation period ranged from 1 to 20 (mean: 5.9 +/- 3.5) days. The duration of hospitalization was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. (2) The initial temperature was (38.3 +/- 0.6) degrees C, while the highest was (39.2 +/- 0.6) degrees C (P {\textless} 0.001), with fever duration of (9.0 +/- 4.2) days. (3) Other most common symptoms included fatigue (93.8{\%}), cough (85.4{\%}), mild sputum production (66.7{\%}), chills (55.2{\%}), headache (39.6{\%}), general malaise (35.4{\%}) and myalgia (21.9{\%}). (4) The radiographic changes were predominantly bilateral in the middle or lower lung zones. The number of affected lung fields was 1.2 +/- 0.8 on presentation, which increased to 2.9 +/- 1.4 after admission (P {\textless} 0.001). The interval from the beginning of fever to the onset of abnormal chest radiographs was (3.5 +/- 2.3) days, which increased in size, extent, and severity to the maximum (6.7 +/- 3.5) days later. The time before the lung opacities were basically absorbed was (14.9 +/- 7.8) days. (5) Leukopenia was observed in 67.7{\%} of this cohort. The time between the onset of fever and leukopenia was (4.4 +/- 2.3) days, with the lowest white blood cell count of (2.80 +/- 0.72) x 10(9)/L. (6) The lowest arterial oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1){\%} with supplementary oxygen. (7) Antibiotical therapies included tetracyclines (91.0{\%}), aminoglycosides (83.3{\%}), quinolones (79.2{\%}); 18.8{\%} of the patients received a combination of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, while 11.5{\%} received a combination of tetracyclines and quinolones, and 63.5{\%} received a combination of tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and quinolones. Vancomycin was used in 13.5{\%} of the patients. (8) 68.8{\%} of the patients were treated with methylprednisolones for a mean interval of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. (9) Human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, antiviral drugs (oral ribavirin or oseltamivir) were used respectively in 68.6{\%}, 46.9{\%} and 92.7{\%} of the patients. (10) Ninety-five patients (99.0{\%}) had a complete clinical recovery, and only 1 patient (1.0{\%}) died. CONCLUSIONS: SARS appears to be quickly infectious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression, and mostly bilateral lung involvement on chest radiographs. Proper administration of glucocorticosteroids seems to be of some benefits. Antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although empirically, might be useful to shorten the clinical course.},

abstract = {The genome comparison of inter-species and intra-species can give us much information about the origin and evolution of viruses. There are 137 mutation sites in the 17 genomes of SARS-CoV,and the mutation rate is about 8.04 x 10(-3) substitution/site/year. The distribution of the segregating sites is not steady,the most variable region appears in S1 protein,and the nucleotide sequence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has very few mutation sites. The substitution bias of nucleotide acids and amino acids indicates the non-random drift products. The comparison of genome structures of SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses shows that SARS-CoV and IBV share the same genome structure. Phylogenetic analyses of conserved genes of coronaviruses indicate that SARS-CoV is a new branch of coronaviruses and appears more close to the group II coronaviruses. Interestingly,SARS-CoV shares some different features with different groups of coronaviruses. Additional analyses show that the first ORFs between S and E genes of some coronaviruses are transmembrane proteins and share the common motif,indicating the possible common ancestor. From the host distribution of different groups of coronaviruses and the phylogeny of s2m,we can deduce that avian is the probable natural host of SARS-CoV.},

abstract = {The E (envelope) protein is the smallest structural protein in all coronaviruses and is the only viral structural protein in which no variation has been detected. We conducted genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV. Based on genome sequencing, we predicted the E protein is a transmembrane (TM) protein characterized by a TM region with strong hydrophobicity and alpha-helix conformation. We identified a segment (NH2-{\_}L-Cys-A-Y-Cys-Cys-N{\_}-COOH) in the carboxyl-terminal region of the E protein that appears to form three disulfide bonds with another segment of corresponding cysteines in the carboxyl-terminus of the S (spike) protein. These bonds point to a possible structural association between the E and S proteins. Our phylogenetic analyses of the E protein sequences in all published coronaviruses place SARS-CoV in an independent group in Coronaviridae and suggest a non-human animal origin.},

The case illustrates the importance of a break in fever between the viraemic and lung inflammatory phases of the illness that occurs before radiographic changes and which may obscure diagnosis.

RESULTS: In the real-time RT-PCR assay, the extent of SARS related coronavirus amplification was measured in terms of the increase in fluorescence during the amplification process. The 145 bp fragment of PCR product was further confirmed by conventional PCR assay and proved by DNA sequencing to be identical to the target sequence to which the probe was hybridized. CONCLUSION: This assay has a broad application for clinical diagnosis and surveillance investigation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) varies widely in the way that asymptomatic carriers are believed to exist in the community. Still there are severe forms of illness in which the patients deteriorate unexpectedly within hours. This study delineates clinical characteristics of such fatal cases of SARS for the purpose of identifying patients with poor outcome. METHOD: Patients with the diagnosis of probable or suspected SARS admitted to the Taipei Veterans General Hospital during the period from March 26, 2003 to May 25, 2003 were included. The medical records of fatal cases were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: During the study period, thirty-six probable cases and 17 suspected cases of SARS were identified. Eight probable but none of the suspected cases died from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with multiple organ dysfunction after a median of 6-day hospital stay (range, 1-30 days). All but 2 patients acquired the infection nosocomially. Of the fatal cases, four were males and 4 females, with the median age of 65 years (range, 29-76 yrs). All except 3 had co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values were abnormal ({\textgreater} 200 U/L) in all patients. The chest radiograph of these fatal cases consistently showed multifocal infiltration over the unilateral or bilateral lobe of the lung. CONCLUSIONS: Patients of SARS who had advanced age, co-morbid conditions, highly elevated LDH and multifocal infiltration over chest radiograph should be closely monitored and actively treated.},

DESIGN: Analysis of the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of patients with SARS. SETTING: Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. Subjects All patients with a diagnosis of SARS between 11 March and 29 March 2003 who had no pre-existing haematological disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to examine factors associated with adverse outcome. RESULTS: 64 male and 93 female patients were included in this study. The most common findings included lymphopenia in 153 (98{\%}) of the 157 patients, neutrophilia in 129 (82{\%}), thrombocytopenia in 87 patients (55{\%}), followed by thrombocytosis in 77 (49{\%}), and isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time in 96 patients (63{\%}). The haemoglobin count dropped by more than 20 g/l from baseline in 95 (61{\%}) patients. Four patients (2.5{\%}) developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. Lymphopenia was shown in haemato-lymphoid organs at postmortem examination. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced age and a high concentration of lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent predictors of an adverse outcome. Subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes were analysed in 31 patients. The counts of CD4 positive and CD8 positive T cells fell early in the course of illness. Low counts of CD4 and CD8 cells at presentation were associated with adverse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal haematological variables were common among patients with SARS. Lymphopenia and the depletion of T lymphocyte subsets may be associated with disease activity.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 11, 2003, to April 2, 2003, 74 patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of SARS underwent CT of the thorax; all underwent thin-section CT except for one patient who underwent conventional CT. Group 1 (n = 23) patients had symptoms of SARS in keeping with criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a positive chest radiograph. Group 2 (n = 17) patients had a high clinical suspicion of SARS but a normal radiograph. Group 3 (n = 34) patients had minor symptoms and a normal chest radiograph. The thin-section CT images were analyzed for ground-glass opacification or consolidation, lesion size in each lung segment, peripheral or central location, interstitial thickening, and other abnormalities. RESULTS: Thin-section CT scans were abnormal only for patients in groups 1 and 2. The patient with only conventional CT scans was in group 3; scans for group 3 patients were normal. Affected segments were predominantly in the lower lobes (91 of 149 affected segments). Common findings included ground-glass opacification, sometimes with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening. The size of each lesion and the total number of segments involved were smaller in group 2 patients. A majority of patients in group 1 (14 of 23) had mixed central and peripheral lesions. In group 2, however, peripheral lesions were more common (10 of 17). In both groups, a purely central lesion was uncommon (one of 23 in group 1 and two of 17 in group 2). CONCLUSION: Common thin-section CT features of SARS are ground-glass opacification and lower lobe and peripheral distribution.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the radiographic appearances and pattern of progression of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chest radiographs obtained at clinical presentation and during treatment in 138 patients with confirmed SARS (66 men, 72 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 20-83 years) were assessed. Radiographic appearances of pulmonary parenchymal abnormality, distribution, and extent of involvement on initial chest radiographs were documented. Recognizable patterns of radiographic progression were determined by comparing the overall mean percentage of lung involvement for each patient on serial radiographs. RESULTS: Initial chest radiographs were abnormal in 108 of 138 (78.3{\%}) patients and showed air-space opacity. Lower lung zone (70 of 108, 64.8{\%}) and right lung (82 of 108, 75.9{\%}) were more commonly involved. In most patients, peripheral lung involvement was more common (81 of 108, 75.0{\%}). Unifocal involvement (59 of 108, 54.6{\%}) was more common than multifocal or bilateral involvement. No cavitation, lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion was demonstrated. Four patterns of radiographic progression were recognized: type 1 (initial radiographic deterioration to peak level followed by radiographic improvement) in 97 of 138 patients (70.3{\%}), type 2 (fluctuating radiographic changes) in 24 patients (17.4{\%}), type 3 (static radiographic appearance) in 10 patients (7.3{\%}), and type 4 (progressive radiographic deterioration) in seven patients (5.1{\%}). Initial focal air-space opacity in 44 of 59 patients (74.6{\%}) progressed to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement during treatment. CONCLUSION: Predominant peripheral location; common progression pattern from unilateral focal air-space opacity to unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement during treatment; and lack of cavitation, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion are the more distinctive radiographic findings of SARS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The importation of SARS was responsible for the outbreaks in Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Canada at a time when this new disease had not been identified. We report the incidence and impact of cases of SARS imported to Singapore between 25 February and 31 May 2003, and describe national measures to prevent further importation. METHODS: Information on imported cases of SARS and measures taken at entry points to Singapore was retrieved from the Ministry of Health and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. RESULTS: Of the 6 imported cases, which all occurred before screening measures were implemented at the airport, only the first resulted in extensive secondary transmission. Of 442973 air passengers screened after measures were implemented, 136 were sent to a designated hospital for further SARS screening; none was diagnosed as having SARS. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS outbreak in Singapore can be traced to the first imported case. The absence of transmission from the other imported cases was probably a result of relatively prompt identification and isolation of cases, together with a low potential for transmission. New imported SARS cases therefore need not lead to major outbreaks if systems are in place to identify and isolate them early. Screening at entry points is costly, has a low yield and is not sufficient in itself, but may be justified in light of the major economic, social and international impact which even a single imported SARS case may have.},

abstract = {Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described homologue of the vasoactive peptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Like ACE, ACE2 is an integral (type I) membrane zinc metallopeptidase, which exists as an ectoenzyme. ACE2 is less widely distributed than ACE in the body, being expressed at highest concentrations in the heart, kidney and testis. ACE2 also differs from ACE in its substrate specificity, functioning exclusively as a carboxypeptidase rather than a peptidyl dipeptidase. A key role for ACE2 appears to be emerging in the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7), allowing it to act as a counter-balance to the actions of ACE. ACE2 has been localised to the endothelial and epithelial cells of the heart and kidney where it may have a role at the cell surface in hydrolysing bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II present in the circulation. A role for ACE2 in the metabolism of other biologically active peptides also needs to be considered. ACE2 also serendipitously appears to act as a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Studies usingace2 (-/-) mice, and other emerging studiesin vivo andin vitro, have revealed that ACE2 has important functions in cardiac regulation and diabetes. Together with its role as a SARS receptor, ACE2 is therefore likely to be an important therapeutic target in a diverse range of disease states.},

The result showed 2/66 cases(3.0{\%}) were positive of SARS-CoV-IgG antibody and 66 cases were negative of SARS-CoV-IgM antibody in the 66 cases healthy controls; in 31 cases with SLE, positive rates of SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody were 58.1{\%} (18/31) and 29{\%} (9/31), respectively, in which 7 cases(22.6{\%}) were positive of both SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody. All samples of positive SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody were negative by RT-PCR. The ELISA kit coated by non-purification antigen may induce the false-positive of SARS-CoV antibody in patients with SLE. This result suggested that the specificity of ELISA tests for SARS was excellent and has low false-positive rates when using SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody tests. A possible cause of false-positive of SARS-CoV-IgG and IgM antibody in SLE patients is coated antigens with SARS-CoV and Vero-E6 cells in ELISA methods.},

METHODS: The RNAs of the virus contained in the sputum samples from established SARS patients were extracted and reversely transcripted, followed by nested PCR using the reversely transcripted cDNA as the template. The PCR products were cloned then into the pMD18-T vectors, followed by sequence analysis. RESULTS: Specific fragments were amplified from the sputum samples of SARS patients, which were confirmed by DNA cloning and sequencing to belong to SARS-associated coronavirus. The Result of Blast shows only the difference in one nucleic acid from the TOR2 strain of SARS-associated coronavirus. CONCLUSION: Sequence analysis has confirmed the existence of SARS-associated coronavirus in the sputum samples of SARS patients, and nested RT-PCR is a quick, easy, and convenient way for the detection of the virus.},

A majority of lesions were located in the middle and lower field (70.9{\%}) with peripheral distribution (69{\%}). Other findings on CT included intralobular and interlobular septal thickening (carzy-paving pattern) (36.4{\%}), bronchiectasis (18.2{\%}) and small pleural effusion (22.7{\%}). CONCLUSION: Common radiologic findings of SARS are ground-glass opacification and mixed lesions of GGO with irregular consolidation and/or granulomas and lower location and peripheral distribution.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics, related risk factors, measures for its control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Data on epidemiological features, pathogens and measures for control were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Since Jan 2003, infectious atypical pneumonia (AP) has become epidemic in Guangzhou city. The first autochthonous case was identified on Jan 2nd. Number of cases started to increase since February and reached peak in the early 10 days of February. Hereafter the epidemic tended to decline in March and since early April, the average number of new cases began to decrease, less than 10 per day. Epidemiological studies revealed that the number of cases aged between 20 and 50 was higher than that below the age of 20. Of the total 966 cases, 429 were males versus 537 females. Geographically, the epidemics covered all 13 districts of Guangzhou, but 95{\%} of the cases concentrated in 7 urban districts. As for professional distribution, health care workers accounted for 28.67{\%} of the total cases. There were 36 deaths, aged from 5 to 89, with half of them older than 60. Out of the victims, 38.9{\%} of them had complications as hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and COPD etc. Data regarding the clustering features of cases showed that there were 42 families having 2 or more cases in one family, while 277 health workers suffered from SARS were concentrated in 28 hospitals. Only one outbreak took place in a public setting but no outbreak was reported in schools. Relevant research also indicated that SARS could be classified as an air-borne infectious disease, transmitted through aerosol and droplets, but close contact also played an important role in the mode of transmission. The disease was highly infectious, suggesting that people who had close contact with patients in the place with poor ventilation was in greater risk of getting infection. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 11 days (mainly from 3 to 8 days), with an average of 5 days. According to our observation, the following measures might be effective such as: early diagnosis, isolation and treatment provided to the patients, and suspected cases under medical observation should also be put in separate places. Improving ventilation and regular disinfection over air and stuff in hospital wards were also recommended. In order to prevent iatrogenic infection, sense on self-protection among health care workers must be strengthened. Patients were not allowed to be visited by any one other than hospital staff. CONCLUSION: SARS is a preventable disease and can be under control. It is of great importance to prevent clustered SARS cases and the prevention of iatrogenic infection is essential.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiologic characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to evaluate the effectiveness on its major control measures in Tianjn. METHODS: Adopting two case reports 1 and 2, designed by the Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a unified case-tracing table including the map of the distribution of close contacts to SARS patients. With those methods, investigation on patients and their close contacts at hospital wards, families, communities and institutions of the patients were carried out. RESULTS: From April 13 through May 8, 2003, there were 175 SARS cases including imported ones, were identified with an incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100,000. Among them, 14 died with a fatality of 8.0{\%}. The whole process of epidemic in Tianjin was less than one month with the following features: (1) 93.7{\%} of the total SARS cases in Tianjin were directly or indirectly transmitted by a super-spreader. (2) 68.6{\%} of the total SARS patients were concentrated in 3 hospitals A, B and C which was menifastated in 'clustering'. Through study on the rest of the SARS patients, results showed that 16.8{\%} of them were transmitted through family close contact and 2.3{\%} due to contact to colleagues. However, 12.6{\%} of the patients were not able to show evidence that they had any contact to a diagnosed SARS patient. At the early stage of the epidemic, a number of medical practitioners were infected, taking up 38.2{\%} of the total SARS cases. Among the total number of 1 975 medical workers who participated in the SARS medical cares and treatments, 3.4{\%} of them got infected. During the outbreak, all index cases and chains of transmission seemed to be clear, with only 3 patients not able to be traced for the source of infection, taking up 2{\%} of the total SARS patients in Tianjin. Among the 10 index cases, only the super spreader and another one index case transmitted the virus to their contacts but the rest of index cases did not cause any secondary infection. CONCLUSION: Though SARS is clinically severe and can be spreaded quickly, the epidemic can be under control within a short period of time if chains of SARS transmission are broken down and effective measures as isolation and quarantine against patients as well as underscoring awareness among the publics in a scientific way, being carried out.},

abstract = {The Coronaviridae family is characterized by a nucleocapsid that is composed of the genome RNA molecule in combination with the nucleoprotein (N protein) within a virion. The most striking physiochemical feature of the N protein of SARS-CoV is that it is a typical basic protein with a high predicted pI and high hydrophilicity, which is consistent with its function of binding to the ribophosphate backbone of the RNA molecule. The predicted high extent of phosphorylation of the N protein on multiple candidate phosphorylation sites demonstrates that it would be related to important functions, such as RNA-binding and localization to the nucleolus of host cells. Subsequent study shows that there is an SR-rich region in the N protein and this region might be involved in the protein-protein interaction. The abundant antigenic sites predicted in the N protein, as well as experimental evidence with synthesized polypeptides, indicate that the N protein is one of the major antigens of the SARS-CoV. Compared with other viral structural proteins, the low variation rate of the N protein with regards to its size suggests its importance to the survival of the virus.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has promptly established a network of international laboratories consisting of 13 members around the 10 countries to facilitate the identification of the causative agent of SARS. A novel coronavirus, SARS virus, fulfilling all of Koch's postulates was announced to be the primary aetiological agent of SARS on April 16 by WHO shortly after the Canadian scientists released the full-length genome sequence of SARS virus (Tor2) on April 12. China is now facing a formidable task to fight SARS. In this article, we present a brief summary on the biological characteristics of coronavirus with its associated diseases, and make some suggestions on how to curb this outbreak and how to cure SARS disease based on the potential targets of this novel virus.},

METHODS: Vero E6 cells infected with lung autopsy samples or nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS patients of Beijing and Guangzhou were inoculated. The supernatant and cultured cells exhibiting identifiable cytopathic effect (CPE) were prepared for electron microscopic study. RESULTS: Examination of CPE cells on thin-section revealed characteristic coronavirus particles within the cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles and extracellular space. They were mainly spherical or oval in shape, annular or dense, about 80 nm in diameter. Negative-stain electron microscopy identified coronavirus particles in culture supernatant, 80 - 120 nm in diameter, with club-shaped surface projections. Elongated, rod-, kidney- or other irregular shaped virons with the size of 100 - 200 nm by 60 - 90 nm were also found in the cultured cells infected with the lung samples from the Guangdong patients. Infectious virons entered cells by endocytosis or membrane fusion and released through a budding process. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a novel coronavirus as the causative agent of SARS. Most viral particles showed typical characteristics of coronavirus. The potential role of special shape viruses is expected to be further investigated.},

METHODS: Each SARS case was interviewed by trained investigator using standardized questionnaire followed a descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Four hundred and three SARS cases were identified and 27 of them died from March 18 and May 31, 2003. The incidence rate of SARS was 18.0/100,000 with case fatality rate as 6.7{\%} in Haidian district, Beijing. Seventy-four percent of patients were adults with higher risk in age group of 20 - 29 year. SARS patients were scattered around in 32 out of 33 streets and villages in this district. The disease appeared to be sporadic but the case of outbreaks in family or university only seen in three streets. The course of SARS epidemic in this district could be divided into three phases: initial-which last for days, peak-21 days and then rapid decline-for 26 days. Number of patients having had a history of close contact to other SARS were gradually decreasing along with the process of the epidemics (trend chi(2) = 8.800, P = 0.003). Seventy-two point seven percent of the SARS cases had been exposed to the injection in the hospital settings. When the epidemics came to a rapid decline, 85.7{\%} of the patients diagnosed during that period could be traced down to have had the history of contacting SARS cases within their own families. The distribution of occupation was also showed significantly different in the three respective stages (chi(2) = 36.41, P {\textless} 0.01). Among the patients who could not be identified as having confirmed contact history, 26.6{\%} having had outward activities and 47.6{\%} of them visited hospitals, especially during the peak stage. CONCLUSION: The intensity of SARS epidemic among the residents of Haidian district was recognized as similar to the other parts of Beijing. Nosocomial infection in hospital settings was most important cause responsible for the transmission of SARS in this district.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reminds us that sudden disease emergence is a permanent part of our world--and should be anticipated in our planning. Historically the emergence of new diseases has had little or no impact beyond a small, localized cluster of infections. However, given just the right conditions, a highly virulent pathogen can suddenly spread across time and space with massive consequences, as has occurred on several occasions in human history. In the wake of the SARS outbreak, we are now forced to confront the unpleasant fact that human activities are increasing the frequency and severity of these kinds of emergences. The idea of more frequent biological "invasions" with economic and societal impacts comparable to SARS, presents stakeholders in and the global economy with unprecedented new risks, challenges and even opportunities. As a major contributor to economic stability, the insurance industry must follow these trends very closely and develop scenarios to anticipate these events.},

abstract = {STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term effects and quality of life (QoL) of using sacral anterior root stimulation (SARS) in spinal cord injured patients. SETTING: Neurosurgical and Urological Departments of a large teaching hospital and a large rehabilitation centre in the Netherlands. METHODS: In all, 42 patients with complete spinal cord injury (SCI) implanted between 1987 and 2000 were included. A questionnaire was constructed to determine complications, technical failures and personal experiences of the patients. The Qualiveen questionnaire was used and the outcome was compared with data obtained from a reference group of 400 SCI patients with neurogenic bladder problems not using the bladder controller. The Qualiveen questionnaire measures disease-specific aspects in four domains with respect to limitations, constraints, fears and feelings and general QoL aspects, suitable for use in SCI patients with urinary disorders. RESULTS: The results of 37 patients are presented. Our results with the bladder controller with respect to medical and technical complications and infection rates are similar to the results presented by others. From users' experiences, the most important advantages reported were a decreased infection rate (68{\%}), improved social life (54{\%}) and continence (54{\%}). Comparison of the obtained results of our patient group with the Qualiveen questionnaire with a reference group not using the bladder controller indicates that the specific impact of urinary disorders in the four domains on QoL is reduced and that general QoL is improved. CONCLUSION: SARS is effective and safe for neurogenic bladder management in patients with complete SCI. Users' experiences are positive. Furthermore, this therapy seems to reduce the effects of urinary-disorder-specific QoL aspects, and to increase the QoL in general.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced into Canada by a visitor to Hong Kong who returned to Toronto on Feb. 23, 2003. Transmission to a family member who was later admitted to a community hospital in Toronto led to a large nosocomial outbreak. In this report we summarize the preliminary results of the epidemiological investigation into the transmission of SARS between 128 cases associated with this hospital outbreak. METHODS: We collected epidemiologic data on 128 probable and suspect cases of SARS associated with the hospital outbreak, including those who became infected in hospital and the next generation of illness arising among their contacts. Incubation periods were calculated based on cases with a single known exposure. Transmission chains from the index family to hospital contacts and within the hospital were mapped. Attack rates were calculated for nurses in 3 hospital wards where transmission occurred. RESULTS: The cases ranged in age from 21 months to 86 years; 60.2{\%} were female. Seventeen deaths were reported (case-fatality rate 13.3{\%}). Of the identified cases, 36.7{\%} were hospital staff. Other cases were household or social contacts of SARS cases (29.6{\%}), hospital patients (14.1{\%}), visitors (14.1{\%}) or other health care workers (5.5{\%}). Of the 128 cases, 120 (93.8{\%}) had documented contact with a SARS case or with a ward where there was a known SARS case. The remaining 8 cases without documented exposure are believed to have had exposure to an unidentified case and remain under investigation. The attack rates among nurses who worked in the emergency department, intensive care unit and coronary care unit ranged from 10.3{\%} to 60.0{\%}. Based on 42 of the 128 cases with a single known contact with a SARS case, the mean incubation period was 5 days (range 2 to 10 days). INTERPRETATION: Evidence to date suggests that SARS is a severe respiratory illness spread mainly by respiratory droplets. There has been no evidence of further transmission within the hospital after the elapse of 2 full incubation periods (20 days).},

We performed a retrospective case series analysis to assess clinical outcome and identify pretreatment prognostic correlates of SARS, managed under a standardized treatment protocol. We studied 127 male and 196 female patients with a mean age of 41+14 (range 18-83). All patients, except two, received ribavirin and steroid combination therapy. In 115 (36{\%}) patients, the course of disease was limited. Pneumonitis progressed rapidly in the remaining patients. Sixty-seven (21{\%}) patients required intensive care, and 42 (13{\%}) required ventilator support. Advanced age, high admission neutrophil count, and high initial lactate dehydrogenase level were independent correlates of an adverse clinical outcome. SARS-associated coronavirus caused severe illnesses in most patients, despite early treatment with ribavirin and steroid. This study has identified three independent pretreatment prognostic correlates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a major infectious disease pandemic that occurred in early 2003, and one of the diagnostic criteria is the presence of chest radiographic findings. OBJECTIVE: To describe the radiographic features of SARS in a cluster of affected children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chest radiographs of four related children ranging in age from 18 months to 9 years diagnosed as having SARS were reviewed for the presence of air-space shadowing, air bronchograms, peribronchial thickening, interstitial disease, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, hilar lymphadenopathy and mediastinal widening. RESULTS: Ill-defined air-space shadowing was the common finding in all the children. The distribution was unifocal or multifocal. No other findings were seen on the radiographs. None of the children developed radiographic findings consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All four children showed significant resolution of the radiographic findings 4-6 days after the initial radiograph. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition of these features is important in implementing isolation and containment measures to prevent the spread of infection. SARS in children appears to manifest as a milder form of the disease as compared to adults.},

Hong Kong and China have been most severely affected by this new infectious disease. The elderly population is highly vulnerable, and mortality in those older than 65 years is more than 50{\%}. In our study, 27 health care workers and 40 elderly residents in a nursing home were interviewed to investigate their level of knowledge of SARS and its prevention. Most of the elderly residents knew little regarding SARS and prevention strategies, despite access to outside news by TV, radio, and visitors. Also, the worry and fear of an outbreak of SARS among staff working in the nursing home was considered to be high. Tailored education programs to promote awareness and prevention of SARS for the elderly are needed. Also, more in-service training, support, and counseling are strongly indicated for staff to promote disease prevention and improve quality of care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Information on the clinical features of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) will be of value to physicians caring for patients suspected of having this disorder. METHODS: We abstracted data on the clinical presentation and course of disease in 10 epidemiologically linked Chinese patients (5 men and 5 women 38 to 72 years old) in whom SARS was diagnosed between February 22, 2003, and March 22, 2003, at our hospitals in Hong Kong, China. RESULTS: Exposure between the source patient and subsequent patients ranged from minimal to that between patient and health care provider. The incubation period ranged from 2 to 11 days. All patients presented with fever (temperature, {\textgreater}38 degrees C for over 24 hours), and most presented with rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles and percussion dullness. Lymphopenia was observed in nine patients, and most patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease. Two patients died of progressive respiratory failure; histologic analysis of their lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy a mean (+/-SD) of 9.6+/-5.42 days after the onset of symptoms, and eight were treated earlier with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide for 4+/-1.9 days, with no clinical or radiologic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: SARS appears to be infectious in origin. Fever followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise is the key complex of signs and symptoms from which the syndrome derives its name. The microbiologic origins of SARS remain unclear.},

abstract = {A common feature of cellular telephony is the use of a 'hands-free' audio extension lead connected to a waist-worn handset. Interaction between the transmitting antenna, the wire and the user's body can occur, with detrimental effects including polar pattern degradation, reduced efficiency and localized increases in specific absorption rate (SAR). Using a realistic full-body model of an adult male, finite difference time domain analysis was employed to investigate the coupling between a hip-mounted 1.8 GHz handset fitted with a monopole antenna and a 1 m long wire representing a hands-free wire. Conduction current densities were computed for three identifiable coupling modes: magnetic-only, conductive-only and combined conductive-and-magnetic. Magnetic-only coupling was dominant. Without the lead, placing the handset at waist height led to a 42.8{\%} increase in the total energy deposited in the body, compared to use at the head. Introducing the lead further increased the body loss, with a reduction in system radiation efficiency from 52{\%} to 43.7{\%}. Without the hands-free lead, the peak 1 g and 10 g SARs were 0.450 W kg(-1) and 0.265 W kg(-1), respectively, for 125 mW transmit power. With the hands-free lead connected, these values increased to 1.14 W kg(-1) and 0.430 W kg(-1), respectively.},

METHODS: There were 91 patients with common SARS, and 23 patients with severe SARS, and 61 common pneumonia patients served as the controls. The liver functions of all the patients were measured. RESULTS: The rate of anomaly liver function in the common SARS patients group was 68.1{\%}, which was higher than that in the common pneumonia patients group (24.6{\%}), chi2=27.7, P{\textless}0.01. The changes mainly existed in the mild to moderate elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. The severe SARS patients were older and the changing rate of liver function was as high as 95.7{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The damage possibility of liver function in SARS patients is higher than that in common pneumonia patients. The damage is light and related to SARS itself. The damage of liver function in the severe SARS patients may have close relationship with age.},

abstract = {New techniques and software have enabled ubiquitous use of structure-activity relationships (SARs) in the pharmaceutical industry and toxicological sciences. We review the status of SAR technology by using examples to underscore the advances as well as the unique technical challenges. Applying SAR involves two steps: Characterization of the chemicals under investigation, and application of chemometric approaches to explore data patterns or to establish the relationships between structure and activity. We describe generally but not exhaustively the SAR methodologies popular use in toxicology, including representation of chemical structure, and chemometric techniques where models are both unsupervised and supervised. The utility of SAR technology is most evident when supervised methods are used to predict toxicity of untested chemicals based only on chemical structure. Such models can predict on both an ordinal scale (e.g., active vs inactive) or a continuouis scale (e.g., median lethal dose [LD50] dose). The reader is also referred to a companion paper in this issue that discusses quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods that have advanced markedly over the past decade.},

In the meantime, SARS has been recognized in patients on all five continents. A novel coronavirus, which is not related to the hitherto known coronaviruses, has been proven to be associated with the disease. Our genomic analyses strongly suggest that the new SARS-coronavirus did not emerge through mutation or recombination and that it has probably been transmitted from a so far not identified animal species to humans. Therefore, it is most likely that SARS virus is a zoonotic agent. A broad body of knowledge originating from research in veterinary medicine indicates that development of vaccines against the SARS-coronavirus may be problematic. The potential danger of such vaccines should not be neglected during the process of vaccine development.},

During that time we investigated the clinical features, treatment, and nursing care of 36 patients and reported on 12 of these patients' perceptions of their illness experience. PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical features, treatment, nursing care and perceptions of the illness experience of patients with SARS in Hong Kong in order to better inform nurses caring for patients with this highly contagious and potentially lethal disease. METHOD: We abstracted data from the medical and nursing records on the clinical features, treatment and nursing care of 36 patients (21 women, 15 men) in whom SARS was diagnosed and who were admitted to the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between March 15 and April 15, 2003. A review of the hospital's policy and procedures on infection control was also undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the patients to elicit their perceptions of the illness experience. FINDINGS: The most common symptoms were cough (83{\%}), dyspnea (80.6{\%}), malaise (69.4{\%}) and fever (61{\%}). Less common symptoms included headache (38.9{\%}), diarrhea (38.9{\%}), dizziness (30.6{\%}), myalgia (25{\%}), chills (19.4{\%}), nausea and vomiting (19.4{\%}) and rigor (the occurrence of a sensation of hot-and-cold and shivering in addition to teeth chattering and bed shaking) (8.3{\%}). All 36 patients received a combination of corticosteroids and ribavirin. The patients were at risk of drug-related adverse reactions and deterioration of respiratory function, and nursing vigilance was required. CONCLUSION: Nursing patients with SARS was challenging as the disease was highly contagious and potentially lethal, and not much was known about this disease. In addition to the use of frontline treatment, infection control and sensitivity to individual responses to sudden and catastrophic illness were required to support these patients. From this outbreak of SARS, we have learned the importance of infection control in containing and controlling the disease. Other lessons included the need to strengthen the surge capacity in our hospitals and support health care workers during the crisis.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia that apparently originated in Guangdong Province of the People's Republic of China in late 2002. This first came to the world's attention in late February 2003, and has since spread worldwide. As of June 23rd 2003, the disease had been reported from 32 countries or regions globally, affecting 8459 people; 805 individuals (9.5 {\%} of the total affected) have died of the disease. A novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS- CoV) has been found in various specimens taken from patients with SARS. Although there has been rapid development of tests to detect SARS Co-V, these tests presently have certain limitations. Definitions of suspected, confirmed and probable cases have been formulated. Measures currently used for the management of patients with SARS include isolation, ribavirin, corticosteroid therapy and mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, almost 10 {\%} of affected patients succumb to their illness, underlying the need for developing more effective therapy. It remains to be seen how long it will take to bring this epidemic under control.},

Coronaviruses are exceptionally large RNA viruses and employ complex regulatory mechanisms to express their genomes. Here, we determined the sequence of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), isolate Frankfurt 1, and characterized key RNA elements and protein functions involved in viral genome expression. Important regulatory mechanisms, such as the (discontinuous) synthesis of eight subgenomic mRNAs, ribosomal frameshifting and post-translational proteolytic processing, were addressed. Activities of three SARS coronavirus enzymes, the helicase and two cysteine proteinases, which are known to be critically involved in replication, transcription and/or post-translational polyprotein processing, were characterized. The availability of recombinant forms of key replicative enzymes of SARS coronavirus should pave the way for high-throughput screening approaches to identify candidate inhibitors in compound libraries.},

The eggs were exposed either continuously throughout the whole 21 days of incubation (long-term exposure) or in a short-term exposure (1-2 h/day). The temperatures of the embryonic tissue and the amniotic fluid, respectively, were measured with inserted temperature probes. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between exposure and temperature changes in exposed tissues, without considering biological and medical effects. This knowledge is of general interest for studies of nonthermic teratological or embryo-lethal effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Throughout the entire 21 days of embryonic development, the mean temperature increases in the eggs during the exposure were found to be up to 0.25 degrees C for a power flux density of 1.25 mW/cm(2) and increased to 2.3 degrees C for 9.0 mW/cm(2). The corresponding maximum whole-body SARs for the embryos over the 21 days of embryonic development were 1.45 and 10.44 W/kg, respectively. At 0.75 mW/cm(2) (0.87 W/kg) the extent of the RF-field induced hyperthermia was within the measurement accuracy (+/-0.1 degrees C) of the temperature probes used in the tests. The field-induced temperature increase was greatest in the first week of incubation and was less pronounced in the last (third) week before hatching. In both the short- and the long-term exposures, the temperature of the exposed tissue and the amniotic fluid, respectively, reached its maximum (asymptotic) approximately 40-50 min after the RF field was switched on. After the field was switched off, the temperature inside the exposed eggs returned to its initial value within 40-50 min.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyse the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics in Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control strategies against it. METHODS: Data from legal communicable diseases surveillance reporting system was analyzed epidemiologically. RESULTS: The first SARS case was reported in Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region on March 27, 2003. Up to May 20, there were 446 cumulative SARS cases in the whole region (with 287 confirmed cases and 159 suspected cases) and 61 cumulative recovered cases had been discharged from the hospitals (56 confirmed cases and 5 suspected cases). Another 131 cases were excluded the original diagnoses of SARS including 10 confirmed cases and 121 suspected cases. 25 confirmed cases died with a mortality rate of 8.7{\%}. Cumulatively, the number of reported cases were distributed in 30 counties in 9 prefectures. Statistical analysis on time sequence of the occurrence of cases showed that majority (67.7{\%} of the total) of the cases concentrated in between April 13 and April 29. The number of cases had started to decrease since April 24 with an average of 5.3 cases per day between May 3 and May 8 and an average of 0.3 cases per day between May 9 and today. CONCLUSIONS: SARS epidemics in our region could be divided into three phases. The first phase fell in between March 18 and April 15 with the first case being imported, the number of cases rose sharply, covering 14 counties in 6 prefectures, having a feature of family clustering. The second phase was from April 16 to April 28, with the appearance of secondary infection, having sharp rise of the cases and spreading to 24 counties in 10 prefectures. One of the major features was that hospitals had become the important sources of secondary infection. Finally, the third phase was between April 29 and May 20, with small wave crests of cases, spreading to 38 counties in 10 prefectures with a high proportion of cases with no history of direct contact with diagnosed SARS patients. Thus, no obvious transmission chain was noticed at this phase.},

abstract = {The putative NTPase/helicase protein from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is postulated to play a number of crucial roles in the viral life cycle, making it an attractive target for anti-SARS therapy. We have cloned, expressed, and purified this protein as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion in Escherichia coli and have characterized its helicase and NTPase activities. The enzyme unwinds double-stranded DNA, dependent on the presence of a 5' single-stranded overhang, indicating a 5'o 3' polarity of activity, a distinct characteristic of coronaviridae helicases. We provide the first quantitative analysis of the polynucleic acid binding and NTPase activities of a Nidovirus helicase, using a high throughput phosphate release assay that will be readily adaptable to the future testing of helicase inhibitors. All eight common NTPs and dNTPs were hydrolyzed by the SARS helicase in a magnesium-dependent reaction, stimulated by the presence of either single-stranded DNA or RNA. The enzyme exhibited a preference for ATP, dATP, and dCTP over the other NTP/dNTP substrates. Homopolynucleotides significantly stimulated the ATPase activity (15-25-fold) with the notable exception of poly(G) and poly(dG), which were non-stimulatory. We found a large variation in the apparent strength of binding of different homopolynucleotides, with dT24 binding over 10 times more strongly than dA24 as observed by the apparent Km.},

METHODS: Subgroups of blood T lymphocytes in 93 patients with SARS were detected by flow cytometer. The results detected in 64 normal subjects and 50 patients with AIDS served as controls. RESULTS: The numbers of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes all significantly decreased in acute phase of patients with SARS [(722 +/- 533)/microliter, (438 +/- 353)/microliter, (307 +/- 217)/microliter] compared with those in normal controls [(1527 +/- 470)/microliter, (787 +/- 257)/microliter, (633 +/- 280)/microliter, all P {\textless}0.01], which was different from what we observed in patients with AIDS who had decreased CD(4)(+) [(296 +/- 298)/microliter] but increased CD(8)(+) [(818 +/- 566)/microliter] counts. The counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes decreased more apparently in patients with severe SARS. All the five patients who died had CD(4)(+) counts less than 200/microliter. As the patients' condition improved, CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) counts gradually returned to normal ranges. CONCLUSION: The damage of cellular immunity is probably an important mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new form of atypical pneumonia caused by a coronavirus. We present the clinical course and chest radiographic findings of a case of SARS with fatal outcome. CLINICAL PICTURE: A 39-year-old Chinese male presented with fever, sore throat and non-productive cough. During his illness, serial chest radiographs showed increasingly severe air-space shadowing in both lungs. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, levofloxacin, oseltamivir, ribavirin and methylprednisolone. As his condition worsened, the required ventilatory and inotropic support. He later developed a myocardial infarct and coagulopathy, and succumbed to his illness. CONCLUSION: The reported case mortality of SARS is about 9{\%} worldwide. In Singapore, the mortality is 15.5{\%}. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is believed to be a contributory factor to our patient's demise. We report this case to show the radiographic changes of ARDS in a patient with SARS.},

abstract = {Humans are exposed to thousands of environmental chemicals for which no developmental toxicity information is available. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) are models that could be used to efficiently predict the biological activity of potential developmental toxicants. However, at this time, no adequate SAR models of developmental toxicity are available for risk assessment. In the present study, a new developmental database was compiled by combining toxicity information from the Teratogen Information System (TERIS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. We implemented a decision tree modeling procedure, using Classification and Regression Tree software and a model ensemble approach termed bagging. We then assessed the empirical distributions of the prediction accuracy measures of the single and ensemble-based models, achieved by repeating our modeling experiment many times by repeated random partitioning of the working database. The decision tree developmental SAR models exhibited modest prediction accuracy. Bagging tended to enhance the accuracy of prediction. Also, the model ensemble approach reduced the variability of prediction measures compared to the single model approach. Further research with data derived from animal species- and endpoint-specific components of an extended and refined FDA/TERIS database has the potential to derive SAR models that would be useful in the developmental risk assessment of the thousands of untested chemicals.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The first-visiting cases of total 272 SARS inpatients admitted in SARS wards in Third Hospital from April 10, 2003 to May 12 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical characteristics and diagnostic decision for these patients were described. METHODS: The enrollment of inpatients was ruled with two official standards, i.e., 'Clinical Standards for Diagnosis of SARS, Trial Edition' from Health Ministry, and 'Diagnostic Standards for SARS' from Joint Force of Prevention and Therapy for SARS in Beijing, PRC. The present work was based on the first-visiting case records of these SARS inpatients. RESULTS: The characteristics of gender, age, occupation, contagious history and previous therapy were described in SARS inpatients when they visited the outpatient department for SARS in the first time; the clinical symptoms, physical signs, blood WBC counts and X-ray in lungs were also analyzed. In 272 inpatients who were admitted into SARS wards at their first visiting, 145 patients (53.5{\%}) were finally diagnosed as SARS, well as 97 patients (35.7{\%}) were eliminated. CONCLUSION: In the first visiting of the suspectable SARS patients, the contagious history, clinical symptoms, laboratory results and lung X-ray should be studied comprehensively and thoroughly to avoid omitted or mistaken diagnosis. Most final diagnosis came from the revising of the original decision. The advances in SARS virology and immunology may provide more accurate evidences in SARS diagnosis.},

METHODS: To generate data on SARS in Sichuan province through descriptive and analytical studies on time, geographic distribution, population, source of infection, the way of case finding, symptom, diagnosis and treatment of the cases. RESULTS: The peak of the epidemic last from April 16 to May 7. The number of cases in Luzhou and Guangyuan cities took up 60{\%} of the total. Mobile population occupied 68{\%} of the cases. Most of the patients were above the age of 20 with a sex ratio of 1.5:1 (m/f). 80{\%} of the cases had a history of working in Guangdong province and recently returned to their hometowns. The main symptoms and signs of the SARS patients would include fever, cough and chest X-ray changes. CONCLUSION: All cases were imported. Fluctuation of the epidemics was mainly affected by the mobility of working population who recently returned to their hometowns. Measures concerning the prevention and control of the epidemics would mainly target on the isolation of confirmed and suspected patients who might serve as the sources of infection through setting up quarantine station, assigned hospitals and special 'fever-clinics'.},

abstract = {The genome organization and expression strategy of the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were predicted using recently published genome sequences. Fourteen putative open reading frames were identified, 12 of which were predicted to be expressed from a nested set of eight subgenomic mRNAs. The synthesis of these mRNAs in SARS-CoV-infected cells was confirmed experimentally. The 4382- and 7073 amino acid residue SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins are predicted to be cleaved into 16 subunits by two viral proteinases (bringing the total number of SARS-CoV proteins to 28). A phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene, using a distantly related torovirus as an outgroup, demonstrated that, despite a number of unique features, SARS-CoV is most closely related to group 2 coronaviruses. Distant homologs of cellular RNA processing enzymes were identified in group 2 coronaviruses, with four of them being conserved in SARS-CoV. These newly recognized viral enzymes place the mechanism of coronavirus RNA synthesis in a completely new perspective. Furthermore, together with previously described viral enzymes, they will be important targets for the design of antiviral strategies aimed at controlling the further spread of SARS-CoV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To study the molecular mechanism of interferon alpha2b(IFNalpha2b) inhibiting the SARS virus replication. SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS virus) cDNA chip was developed and applied to detect the virus RNA transcription levels in the interferon-treated and untreated cell cultures, and the mechanism of anti-SARS virus activity of interferon alpha2b in cell culture system was explored. METHODS: SARS virus cDNA chip was prepared by comparing the published SARS virus genome sequence, and the cDNA chip was used to study the interferon alpha2b function during SARS virus replication. RESULTS: SARS virus cDNA chip was successfully prepared by using PCR method. The results showed that the cDNA chip could be used to detect the viral RNA transcription level. Interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost all the SARS virus gene transcription. An unknown gene at the position 28130-28426 bp, named as U gene, may play an important role during the viral replication. CONCLUSION: A SARS virus whole genome cDNA chip was established. It could be used to study the virus molecular biology and antiviral drug screening. The results also showed that interferon alpha2b could inhibit almost the whole virus gene transcription by using the cDNA chip.},

There are many hypotheses to explain this paradox; 1) Is it the hygiene theory, namely extensive use of wide spread and too potent antibiotics which eliminate protective infecting agent? And hence the beneficial effect of probiotics? Is it the widespread use of vaccine? Is it a mistake or a terror acts of leakage of viral mutant from research or other laboratories? Be it as it may, the globalization and the employment of long distance flights make the spread easy to extreme points in the globe (Shanghai-Toronto). The new epidemiology? Immunology fields will have to deal with these novel aspects to combat and to prevent more events.},

abstract = {The 60mer oligonucleotide microarray was designed and applied to detecting of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus. Thirty 60mer specific oligos were designed to cover the whole genome of the first submitted coronavirus strain, according to the sequence of TOR2 (GENEBANK Accession: AY274119). These primers were synthesized and printed into a microarray with 12 ×12 spots. RNAs were extracted from the throat swab and gargling fluid of SARS patients and reverse-transcripted into the double strand cDNAs. The cDNAs were prepared as restricted cDNA fragments by the restriction display (RD) technique and labeled by PCR with the Cy5-universal primer. The labeled samples were then applied to the oligo microarray for hybridization. The diagnostic capability of the microarray was evaluated after the washing and scanning steps. The scanning result showed that samples of SARS patients were hybridized with multiple SARS probes on the microarray, and there is no signal on the negative and blank controls. These results indicate that the genome of SARS coronavirus can be detected in parallel by the 60mer oligonucleotide microarray, which can improve the positive ratio of the diagnosis. The oligo microarray can also be used for monitoring the behavior of the virus genes in different stages of the disease status.},

In the middle of May, people felt the highest level of risk on the SARS pathogens; the following are the physical health condition and infectivity after recovering from SARS; they are factors that need special attention. SEM result analyses supported our hypotheses in that SARS-related information affect people's coping behavior and mental health through their risk perception, the four indices of risk assessment, feeling of nervousness, coping behavior and mental health are effective presentimental indices for public psychological behavior in risky events.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 54 SARS patients, including survivors (43 cases) and nonsurvivors (11 cases) were collected and evaluated with APACHE III scoring system. The correlation of scores and prognosis was evaluated. RESULTS: The scores of the nonsurvivors were higher remarkably than those of the surviving group(P{\textless}00.01). The scores of the acute physiology score (APS) and year score (YS) in the death group were higher obviously than those of the surviving group(both P{\textless}0.01). Elderly patients with severe disease had a high mortality. The scores of APACHE III had positive correlation with the over all fatality rate. When the scores of APACHE III was higher than 60, the fatality rate increased obviously. CONCLUSION: The scores of APACHE III in the SARS are correlated with the patient's condition and prognosis.},

abstract = {AIM: To obtain the pure sample of SARS small envelope E protein (SARS E protein), study its properties and analyze its possible functions. METHODS: The plasmid of SARS E protein was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the protein was expressed in the E coli strain. The secondary structure feature of the protein was determined by circular dichroism (CD) technique. The possible functions of this protein were annotated by bioinformatics methods, and its possible three-dimensional model was constructed by molecular modeling. RESULTS: The pure sample of SARS E protein was obtained. The secondary structure feature derived from CD determination is similar to that from the secondary structure prediction. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the key residues of SARS E protein were much conserved compared to the E proteins of other coronaviruses. In particular, the primary amino acid sequence of SARS E protein is much more similar to that of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and other mammal coronaviruses. The transmembrane (TM) segment of the SARS E protein is relatively more conserved in the whole protein than other regions. CONCLUSION: The success of expressing the SARS E protein is a good starting point for investigating the structure and functions of this protein and SARS coronavirus itself as well. The SARS E protein may fold in water solution in a similar way as it in membrane-water mixed environment. It is possible that beta-sheet I of the SARS E protein interacts with the membrane surface via hydrogen bonding, this beta-sheet may uncoil to a random structure in water solution.},

All participants were surveyed about use of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS. 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0.0224). Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0.0001), gowns (p=0.006), and washed their hands (p=0.047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0.011). Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS. The protective role of the mask suggests that in hospitals, infection is transmitted by droplets.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive pathogen that is capable of expressing a variety of virulence proteins in response to environmental signals. Virulence protein expression in S. aureus is controlled by a network of regulatory loci including sarA and agr. The sarA/agr network is associated with the expression of cell wall-associated adhesins during exponential growth and the expression of secreted enzymes and toxins in the transition to post-exponential growth. A number of sarA homologs, including sarT and sarS, have been identified in the S. aureus genome. Previous studies have shown that sarA influences expression of both sarT and sarS in the global regulatory network. SarS has been shown to bind to the spa promoter to induce expression of protein A. SarT, one of the SarA homologs that represses hla expression and is repressible by SarA and agr, was found to induce sarS expression in this report. Northern blot analysis of sarS and spa expression in S. aureus RN6390, and the isogenic sarT, sarT sarA, and sarT agr mutants showed that while sarA regulated spa expression directly, the agr locus used sarT as an intermediary to regulate sarS, thus leading to spa repression in agr-activated cells. Gel shift and footprinting analysis showed that SarT binds to the sarS promoter, indicating that the interaction of the sarT gene product with the upstream region of sarS is likely direct. Induction of sarS and spa by SarT in agr(+) strains was confirmed by a tetracycline-inducible system to titrate sarT expression.},

abstract = {Since the original work by Hering and Breuer (1868) on slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (SARs), numerous studies have demonstrated that these receptors are the lung vagal afferents responsible for eliciting the reflexes evoked by moderate lung inflation. SARs play a role in controlling breathing pattern, airway smooth muscle tone, systemic vascular resistance, and heart rate. Both anatomical and physiological studies support the contention that SARs, by their close association with airway smooth muscle, continuously sense the tension within the myoelastic components of the airways caused by lung inflation, smooth muscle contraction, and/or tethering of small intrapulmonary airways to the lung parenchyma. As a result, the receptor field location within the tracheobronchial tree of a SAR plays an important role in its discharge pattern, with variations in airway transluminal pressure and airway smooth muscle orientation being important modulating factors. The disruption of airway myoelastic components in various pulmonary diseases would be expected to alter the discharge pattern of SARs, and contribute to changes in breathing pattern and airway smooth muscle tone.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new coronavirus. Whole genome sequence analysis of various isolates might provide an indication of potential strain differences of this new virus. Moreover, mutation analysis will help to develop effective vaccines. METHODS: We sequenced the entire SARS viral genome of cultured isolates from the index case (SIN2500) presenting in Singapore, from three primary contacts (SIN2774, SIN2748, and SIN2677), and one secondary contact (SIN2679). These sequences were compared with the isolates from Canada (TOR2), Hong Kong (CUHK-W1 and HKU39849), Hanoi (URBANI), Guangzhou (GZ01), and Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, BJ04). FINDINGS: We identified 129 sequence variations among the 14 isolates, with 16 recurrent variant sequences. Common variant sequences at four loci define two distinct genotypes of the SARS virus. One genotype was linked with infections originating in Hotel M in Hong Kong, the second contained isolates from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Beijing with no association with Hotel M (p{\textless}0.0001). Moreover, other common sequence variants further distinguished the geographical origins of the isolates, especially between Singapore and Beijing. INTERPRETATION: Despite the recent onset of the SARS epidemic, genetic signatures are emerging that partition the worldwide SARS viral isolates into groups on the basis of contact source history and geography. These signatures can be used to trace sources of infection. In addition, a common variant associated with a non-conservative aminoacid change in the S1 region of the spike protein, suggests that immunological pressures might be starting to influence the evolution of the SARS virus in human populations.},

To evaluate the relative effects of three potential laryngeal lubricants on phonatory function (ie, water, Mannitol--an osmotic agent, and Entertainer's Secret Throat Relief (Kli Corp., Carmel, IN)--a glycerin-based product), phonation threshold pressure (PTP) was measured in 18 healthy, vocally normal female participants twice before (baseline) and then four times after 2 ml of each substance were nebulized. PTP is the minimum subglottal pressure required to initiate vocal fold oscillation, and the lowering of PTP is assumed to correspond to physiologically more efficient phonation and reduced phonatory effort. Over a 3-week period, participants were tested on three separate occasions (at 1-week intervals). On each occasion, a different nebulized treatment was administered. PTP for both comfortable and high fundamental frequency productions was measured using an oral pressure-flow system (Perci-Sars, MicroTronics Corp., Chapel Hill, NC). Analysis of the results revealed that Mannitol, an agent that encourages osmotic water flux to the luminal airway surface, lowered PTP immediately after its administration (ie, p = 0.071, for high-pitched productions only). However, the duration of its PTP lowering effect was less than 20 minutes. The other two substances did not demonstrate any significant postadministration effect on PTP.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the first 10 weeks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. The epidemic to date has been characterized by two large clusters-initiated by two separate "super-spread" events (SSEs)-and by ongoing community transmission. By fitting a stochastic model to data on 1512 cases, including these clusters, we show that the etiological agent of SARS is moderately transmissible. Excluding SSEs, we estimate that 2.7 secondary infections were generated per case on average at the start of the epidemic, with a substantial contribution from hospital transmission. Transmission rates fell during the epidemic, primarily as a result of reductions in population contact rates and improved hospital infection control, but also because of more rapid hospital attendance by symptomatic individuals. As a result, the epidemic is now in decline, although continued vigilance is necessary for this to be maintained. Restrictions on longer range population movement are shown to be a potentially useful additional control measure in some contexts. We estimate that most currently infected persons are now hospitalized, which highlights the importance of control of nosocomial transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In February 2003, a newly emerged infectious disease was described, the etiology of which was initially unknown. It is referred to under the term SARS. In the beginning, it spread in some regions South-East Asia. Import infections appeared in many other parts of the world. Based on the first cases in Germany, this report illustrates the clinical appearance, the diagnostic results and the management of this new disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed the data of two patients with SARS and one suspected patient. The results of radiological, laboratory, microbiological and physical examinations were abstracted and compared with the data obtained in other regions. RESULTS: Two of the three patients under our care developed SARS disease. This is characterised by fever of sudden onset lasting for more than 5 days, rapidly changing consolidations in chest x-ray not affected by antimicrobial therapy, leuko-, lympho- as well as thrombopenia with a compromised pulmonary function later in the course. Close contacts with SARS patients does not regularly result in full development of the disease. Secretion of a coronavirus could be detected in respiratory samples during the febrile phase and in feces for a longer time. It is still an open question whether bedrest and antibiotic prophylaxis by themselves or an additional administration of ribavirin and corticosteroids can improve the outcome. CONCLUSION: SARS is a new and highly contagious lung disease. It is crucial to be able to recognize the clinical appearance and the diagnostic features of this disease at an early stage, in order to prevent a further dissemination of the disease.},

abstract = {The sudden appearance and potential lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in humans has focused attention on understanding its origins. Here, we assess phylogenetic relationships for the SARS-CoV lineage as well as the history of host-species shifts for SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. We used a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach with sliding window analyses of three SARS-CoV proteins: RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S). Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3' fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5' tree could be rejected for the 3' region, and the optimal 3' tree could be rejected for the 5' region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1-3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3' RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.},

abstract = {In the face of the worldwide threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to human life, some of the most urgent challenges are to develop fast and accurate analytical methods for early diagnosis of this disease as well as to create a safe anti-viral vaccine for prevention. To these ends, we investigated the antigenicity of the spike protein (S protein), a major structural protein in the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Based upon the theoretical analysis for hydrophobicity of the S protein, 18 peptides were synthesized. Using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), these peptides were screened in the sera from SARS patients. According to these results, two fragments of the S gene were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-32a. Both S fragments were expressed in the BL-21 strain and further purified with an affinity chromatography. These recombinant S fragments were confirmed to have positive cross-reactions with SARS sera, either by Western blot or by ELISA. Our results demonstrated that the potential epitope regions were located at Codons 469-882 in the S protein, and one epitope site was located at Codons 599-620. Identification of antigenic regions in the SARS-CoV S protein may be important for the functional studies of this virus or the development of clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) convalescent stool shedding by RT-PCR. METHODS: One hundred and three stool samples from 46 SARS patients were collected on May 16th, 20th, and 23rd, 2003. For each sample, RNA was extracted using commercial kit and 7 Nest RT-PCR using a 14-pair different SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) special primers were carried out simultaneously. RESULTS: Among these 46 SARS patients, 17 cases (37.0{\%}) were stool SARS-CoV RT-PCR negative, and 29 cases (63.0{\%}) were SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive. The duration of positive cases lasted (31.76 +/- 10.78) d (12-64 d). The longest stool shedding case in this study lasted 64 days. Two serial stool samples and for each sample 2 RT-PCR tests using different primers were positive in this case. CONCLUSIONS: Our study observed longest stool shedding of SARS patients to be 64 days after initial onset of SARS. The average stool shedding was 32 days. Hence it is important to think highly of SARS convalescent patient stool sterilization.},

abstract = {A novel series of potent, selective HIV-1 N-acylthiocarbamate (ATC) nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) is described. The title compounds were synthesized through a highly convergent, one-pot procedure. In cell-based assays, the lead compound (17c) prevented the HIV-1 multiplication with an EC(50) of 8 microM. The lead optimization strategy was developed by single or multiple modifications of the three molecular portions, in which 17c was notionally divided. Molecular modeling studies led to the synthesis of O-(2-phthalimidoethyl)-N-(p-substituted phenyl)-N-acylthiocarbamates, which showed in vitro activities against HIV-1 in the low nanomolar range. Nevertheless, the title compounds retained low potency against HIV-1 strains carrying mutations (K103R, Y181C, and K103N/Y181C) responsible for NNRTI resistance. The hypothetical docking model of RT/17c and RT/25c, derived from X-ray crystallographic structure of a PETT derivative in complex with HIV-1 RT, revealed that the model structures of ATCs do not approximate the NNRTI butterfly-like conformation. Analysis of these hypotetical complexes helps to rationalize some SARs and resistance data.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical and radiological features of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to evaluate the accuracy of the World Health Organization's guidelines on defining cases of SARS. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A newly set up SARS screening clinic in the emergency department of a university hospital in Hong Kong's New Territories. PARTICIPANTS: 556 hospital staff, patients, and relatives who attended the screening clinic and who had had contact with someone with SARS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of confirmed cases of SARS. RESULTS: Of the 556 people, 141 were admitted to hospital, and 97 had confirmed SARS. Fever, chills, malaise, myalgia, rigor, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, and neck pain but not respiratory tract symptoms were significantly more common among the 97 patients than among the other patients. The overall accuracy of the WHO guidelines for identifying suspected SARS was 83{\%} and their negative predictive value was 86{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval 83{\%} to 89{\%}). They had a sensitivity of 26{\%} (17{\%} to 36{\%}) and a specificity of 96{\%} (93{\%} to 97{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Current WHO guidelines for diagnosing suspected SARS may not be sufficiently sensitive in assessing patients before admission to hospital. Daily follow up, evaluation of non-respiratory, systemic symptoms, and chest radiography would be better screening tools.},

In February 2003, cases were reported in Hong Kong and from there the disease spread to many other countries, mainly, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam and Toronto in Canada. The syndrome was defined as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS), and a person is suspected of having SARS if he/she became ill after November 1 2002, has a fever exceeding 38 degrees C, has symptoms of a respiratory disease and was in a risk area or in close contact with a SARS patient within ten days prior the appearance of symptoms. The World Health Organization has received reports of 4,836 cases, of which 293 persons have died. Most were family members or medical staff treating the patient, persons who came into close and prolonged contact with the patient. The estimated incubation period is two days to one week. Symptoms of the disease include fever, shortness of breath and cough. Ten percent of patients afflicted with SARS require artificial breathing. The mortality rate is 6-7{\%}. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Infection is transmitted from person to person through direct or close contact with airborne droplets or personal objects of an infected person. Patients must be isolated and treated by contact and airborne isolation. Treatment consists of support care and artificial respiration when required. The use of anti-viral medications has not yet proven effective.},

Now that the SARS outbreak is under control, hospitals struggle with the balance between adhering to patient- and family-centred care models, and addressing the future threat of infectious diseases. To evaluate the effect of visitor restrictions and to guide future visitation policies, the Ottawa Hospital conducted a preliminary survey of patients, next of kin, staff, physicians and volunteers. Ninety percent of staff surveyed supported some form of visitor restrictions, while 71{\%} indicated that they felt comfortable asking visitors to leave if they had exceeded current restrictions. The majority of patients (80{\%}) and next of kin (76{\%}) were at least moderately satisfied with current restricted limiting hours. A disproportionate number of positive comments on current visiting restrictions were received from both patients and staff. In the absence of evidence on which to base future visitor policy development, objective input from healthcare workers, patients and families is invaluable.},

abstract = {AIM: To predict the probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV by bioinformatics analysis. The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS: Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS-CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS: The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV locates at the 3' end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS-CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS: The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.},

abstract = {The genome sequence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-associated virus provides essential information for the identification of pathogen(s), exploration of etiology and evolution, interpretation of transmission and pathogenesis, development of diagnostics, prevention by future vaccination, and treatment by developing new drugs. We report the complete genome sequence and comparative analysis of an isolate (BJ01) of the coronavirus that has been recognized as a pathogen for SARS. The genome is 29725 nt in size and has 11 ORFs (Open Reading Frames). It is composed of a stable region encoding an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (composed of 2 ORFs) and a variable region representing 4 CDSs (coding sequences) for viral structural genes (the S, E, M, N proteins) and 5 PUPs (putative uncharacterized proteins). Its gene order is identical to that of other known coronaviruses. The sequence alignment with all known RNA viruses places this virus as a member in the family of Coronaviridae. Thirty putative substitutions have been identified by comparative analysis of the 5 SARS-associated virus genome sequences in GenBank. Fifteen of them lead to possible amino acid changes (non-synonymous mutations) in the proteins. Three amino acid changes, with predicted alteration of physical and chemical features, have been detected in the S protein that is postulated to be involved in the immunoreactions between the virus and its host. Two amino acid changes have been detected in the M protein, which could be related to viral envelope formation. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the possibility of non-human origin of the SARS-associated viruses but provides no evidence that they are man-made. Further efforts should focus on identifying the etiology of the SARS-associated virus and ruling out conclusively the existence of other possible SARS-related pathogen(s).},

The most striking discovery from the isolate is an extra 29-nucleotide sequence located at the nucleotide positions between 27,863 and 27,864 (referred to the complete sequence of BJ01) within an overlapped region composed of BGI-PUP5 (BGI-postulated uncharacterized protein 5) and BGI-PUP6 upstream of the N (nucleocapsid) protein. The discovery of this minor genotype, GD-Ins29, suggests a significant genetic event and differentiates it from the previously reported genotype, the dominant form among all sequenced SARS-CoV isolates. A 17-nt segment of this extra sequence is identical to a segment of the same size in two human mRNA sequences that may interfere with viral replication and transcription in the cytosol of the infected cells. It provides a new avenue for the exploration of the virus-host interaction in viral evolution, host pathogenesis, and vaccine development.},

abstract = {SARS-CoV, as the pathogeny of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is a mystery that the origin of the virus is still unknown even a few isolates of the virus were completely sequenced. To explore the genesis of SARS-CoV, the FDOD method previously developed by us was applied to comparing complete genomes from 12 SARS-CoV isolates to those from 12 previously identified coronaviruses and an unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed. Our results show that all SARS-CoV isolates were clustered into a clique and previously identified coronaviruses formed the other clique. Meanwhile, the three groups of coronaviruses depart from each other clearly in our tree that is consistent with the results of prevenient papers. Differently, from the topology of the phylogenetic tree we found that SARS-CoV is more close to group 1 within genus coronavirus. The topology map also shows that the 12 SARS-CoV isolates may be divided into two groups determined by the association with the SARS-CoV from the Hotel M in Hong Kong that may give some information about the infectious relationship of the SARS.},

abstract = {Dinapsoline ((2); (+/-)-dihydroxy-2,3,7,11b-tetrahydro-1H-naphth[1,2,3-de]isoquinoline) is a full D(1) dopamine agonist that also has significant D(2) receptor affinity. Based on a similar pharmacophore, dinapsoline has pharmacological similarities to dihydrexidine ((1); (+/-)-trans-10,11-dihydroxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine), the first high affinity full D(1) agonist. Small alkyl substitutions on the dihydrexidine backbone are known to alter markedly the D(1):D(2) selectivity of dihydrexidine, and it was of interest to determine whether similar SAR exists within the dinapsoline series. This report describes the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of six analogues of dinapsoline: N-allyl-(3);N-n-propyl- (4); 6-methyl- (5); 4-methyl- (6); 4-methyl-N-allyl- (7); and 4-methyl-N-n-propyl-dinapsoline (8). As expected from earlier studies with the dihydrexidine backbone, N-allyl (3) or N-n-propyl (4) analogues had markedly decreased D(1) affinity. Unexpectedly, and unlike the dihydrexidine series, these same substituents did not markedly increase D(2) affinity. The addition of a methyl group to position 6 (5) increased D(1):D(2) selectivity, but less markedly than did the analogous 2-methyl substituent added to 1. Unlike the analogous 4-methyl substituent of 1, the addition of a 4-methyl-group (6) actually decreased D(1) affinity without affecting D(2) affinity. These data demonstrate that the dinapsoline (2) backbone can be modified to produce dopamine agonists with novel properties. Moreover, as rigid ligands in which small substituents can cause significant changes in selectivity, they are important tools for deriving 'differential' SARs of the dopamine receptor isoforms.},

abstract = {In our continuing program exploring glucose-based peptidomimetics of somatostatin (SRIF-14), we sought to improve the water solubility of our glycosides. This led to insights into the nature of the ligand binding sites at the SRIF receptor. Replacement of the C4 benzyl substituent in glucoside (+)-2 with pyridinylmethyl or pyrazin-2-ylmethyl congeners increased water solubility and enhanced affinity for the human SRIF subtype receptor 4 (sst4). We attribute this effect to hydrogen bond formation. The pyridin-3-ylmethyl substituent at C4, when combined with the imidazol-4-ylmethyl group at C2, generated (-)-19, which has the highest affinity of a glucose-based peptidomimetic at a human SRIF receptor to date (K(i) 53 +/- 23 nM, n = 6 at sst4). The C4 heterocyclic congeners of glucosides bearing a 1-methoxy substituent rather than an indole side chain at the anomeric carbon, such as (+)-16, also provided information about the Trp(8) binding pocket. We correlated the SARs at both the C4 and the Trp(8) binding pockets with calculations of the electrostatic potentials of the diverse C4 aromatic substituents using Spartan 3-21G(*) MO analysis. These calculations provide an approximate analysis of a molecule's ability to interact within a receptor binding site. Our binding studies show that benzene and indole rings, but not pyridinylmethyl nor pyrazin-2-ylmethyl rings, can bind the hydrophobic Trp(8) binding pocket of sst4. The Spartan 3-21G(*) MO analysis reveals significant negative electrostatic potential in the region of the pi-clouds for the benzene and indole rings but not for the pyridinylmethyl or pyrazin-2-ylmethyl congeners. Our data further demonstrate that the replacement of benzene or indole side chains by heterocyclic aromatic rings typified by pyridine and pyrazine not only enhances water solubility and hydrogen bonding capacity as expected, but can also profoundly diminish the ability of the pi-cloud of the aromatic substituent to interact with side chains of an aromatic binding pocket such as that for Trp(8) of SRIF-14. Conversely, these calculations accommodate the experimental findings that pyrazin-2-ylmethyl and pyridinylmethyl substituents at C4- of C1-indole-substituted glycosides afford higher affinities at sst4 than the C4-benzyl group of (+)-2. This result is consistent with the high electron density in the plane of the heterocycle depicted in Figure 6 which can accept hydrogen bonds from the C4 binding pocket of the receptor. Unexpectedly, we found that the 2-fluoropyridin-5-ylmethyl analogue (+)-14 more closely resembles the binding affinity of (+)-8 than that of (+)-2, thus suggesting that (+)-14 represents a rare example of a carbon linked fluorine atom acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor. We attribute this result to the ability of the proton to bind the nitrogen and fluorine atoms simultaneously in a bifurcated arrangement. At the NK1 receptor of substance P (SP), the free hydroxyl at C4 optimizes affinity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a condition of unknown cause that has recently been recognized in patients in Asia, North America, and Europe. This report summarizes the initial epidemiologic findings, clinical description, and diagnostic findings that followed the identification of SARS in Canada. METHODS: SARS was first identified in Canada in early March 2003. We collected epidemiologic, clinical, and diagnostic data from each of the first 10 cases prospectively as they were identified. Specimens from all cases were sent to local, provincial, national, and international laboratories for studies to identify an etiologic agent. RESULTS: The patients ranged from 24 to 78 years old; 60 percent were men. Transmission occurred only after close contact. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (in 100 percent of cases) and malaise (in 70 percent), followed by nonproductive cough (in 100 percent) and dyspnea (in 80 percent) associated with infiltrates on chest radiography (in 100 percent). Lymphopenia (in 89 percent of those for whom data were available), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (in 80 percent), elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels (in 78 percent), and elevated creatinine kinase levels (in 56 percent) were common. Empirical therapy most commonly included antibiotics, oseltamivir, and intravenous ribavirin. Mechanical ventilation was required in five patients. Three patients died, and five have had clinical improvement. The results of laboratory investigations were negative or not clinically significant except for the amplification of human metapneumovirus from respiratory specimens from five of nine patients and the isolation and amplification of a novel coronavirus from five of nine patients. In four cases both pathogens were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: SARS is a condition associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It appears to be of viral origin, with patterns suggesting droplet or contact transmission. The role of human metapneumovirus, a novel coronavirus, or both requires further investigation.},

Travellers were asked about contact with SARS and possible symptoms, were screened for high fever, provided with health information and observed for any clinical signs. Arrangements were in place for dealing with ill travellers and for contact tracing of fellow travellers. There were also extra measures that could only be justified by the reassurance they provided. The overall impact of these measures in preventing international spread of SARS is unknown, but the experience could contribute to the control of future epidemics.},

abstract = {Smallpox was declared to be eradicated on 8 May 1980, during the Thirty-third World Health Assembly. However, concerns about the possible use of the virus as a weapon of bioterrorism have increased in recent years. Governments have responded by initiating selective vaccination programmes and other public health measures. This review uses historical data from 20th century outbreaks to assess the risks to current populations (which have declining immunity) from a deliberate release of virus. The data presented supports the conclusion of a previous reviewer (Mack) that "smallpox cannot be said to live up to its reputation. Far from being a quick-footed menace, it has appeared as a plodding nuisance with more bark than bite." Its R value (the average number of secondary cases infected by a primary case) is lower than that for measles, human parvovirus, chickenpox, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis; only the value for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is lower. Like SARS, close person-to-person contact is required for effective spread of the disease, and exposure to the virus in hospitals has played an important role in transmission for both viruses. In the present paper the dangers of mass vaccination are emphasized, along with the importance of case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine of close contacts for outbreak control. The need for rapid diagnosis and the continued importance of maintaining a network of electron microscopes for this purpose are also highlighted.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in some areas of Guangdong province and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control measures against it. METHODS: Standardized questionnaire was used on individual cases. Data on the epidemiological characteristics as time, place, persons and aggregation status of SARS cases, development of the epidemics, were analyzed with software EPI 6.0. RESULTS: The incidence of SARS in Guangdong province was 1.72/100,000 with case fatality rate as 3.64{\%}. Most cases of SARS occurred between the last ten days of January and the first ten days of February with the peak (61.88{\%} of the patients) occurred in the first ten days of February. As to the distribution of place, Pearl river delta region-economically developed with great number of mobile population-was heavily affected areas (account for 96.66{\%} of the total patients). The majority of patients were young adults and medical staff seemed to be the most affected subgroup (account for 24.9{\%} of the patients in total). Family and hospital aggregation of patients comprised the another two important characteristics of SARS (account for 37.1{\%} of the total patients). CONCLUSION: Current knowledge on SARS suggested that it was an air-borne infectious disease with human beings served as the source of infection. The incubation period of the disease was from 1 to 12 days with a median of 4 days. Respiratory secretions and close contact contributed to person-to-person transmission. Most cases were distributed in Pearl river delta region, an area famous for its economic development and heavy flow of mobile population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been reported in Hong Kong. We investigated the viral cause and clinical presentation among 50 patients. METHODS: We analysed case notes and microbiological findings for 50 patients with SARS, representing more than five separate epidemiologically linked transmission clusters. We defined the clinical presentation and risk factors associated with severe disease and investigated the causal agents by chest radiography and laboratory testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates and sera samples. We compared the laboratory findings with those submitted for microbiological investigation of other diseases from patients whose identity was masked. FINDINGS: Patients' age ranged from 23 to 74 years. Fever, chills, myalgia, and cough were the most frequent complaints. When compared with chest radiographic changes, respiratory symptoms and auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild. Patients who were household contacts of other infected people and had older age, lymphopenia, and liver dysfunction were associated with severe disease. A virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae was isolated from two patients. By use of serological and reverse-transcriptase PCR specific for this virus, 45 of 50 patients with SARS, but no controls, had evidence of infection with this virus. INTERPRETATION: A coronavirus was isolated from patients with SARS that might be the primary agent associated with this disease. Serological and molecular tests specific for the virus permitted a definitive laboratory diagnosis to be made and allowed further investigation to define whether other cofactors play a part in disease progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the temporal progression of the clinical, radiological, and virological changes in a community outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: We followed up 75 patients for 3 weeks managed with a standard treatment protocol of ribavirin and corticosteroids, and assessed the pattern of clinical disease, viral load, risk factors for poor clinical outcome, and the usefulness of virological diagnostic methods. FINDINGS: Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85{\%}) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8.9 (SD 3.1) days, 55 (73{\%}) had watery diarrhoea after 7.5 (2.3) days, 60 (80{\%}) had radiological worsening after 7.4 (2.2) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45{\%}) after 8.6 (3.0) days. In 34 (45{\%}) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12{\%}) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20{\%}) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0.001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97{\%}) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. INTERPRETATION: The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.},

Targeted against the influenza neuraminidase enzyme these inhibitors have been shown to reduce both the severity and duration of influenza illness. Importantly, it is expected that these neuraminidase inhibitors would be effective against influenza pandemic strain and could therefore be vital at reducing the potentially devastating consequences of such an outbreak. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of these drugs, they are not commonly used, particularly in the UK, and there is substantial concern that in the event of a pandemic or even a severe epidemic there could be substantial morbidity and mortality. SARS has shown that the public and media response to a serious epidemic is not always rational and this could easily become panic if it became apparent that treatment was possible, but not available.},

abstract = {The coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets. Typical presenting symptoms are akin to those of ordinary pneumonia. Young patients start with fever, chills, malaise, headache, or myalgia; cough and dyspnoea follow. Older persons and those taking corticosteroids may have neither fever nor respiratory symptoms. Exceptional suspicion is needed to identify SARS early in the illness. During an outbreak, even patients with low suspicion of SARS should be promptly isolated, and all contacts quarantined. Health workers need training in the use of appropriate barriers against droplets and other body fluids. Any fever cluster in patients or carers requires immediate action: discharges, visits, and transfers between wards and hospitals should be stopped. Halting hospital admissions and ten-day quarantine of suspected cases create wide buffer zones. To counter a possible resurgence of SARS, a system of prepared isolation and quarantine facilities is important.},

abstract = {Recent acts of terrorism have ranged from the dissemination of anthrax spores to intentional contamination of food to the release of chemical weapons to suicide attacks using explosives. The prediction of such events is difficult, if not impossible. The recent attacks that have generated massive numbers of injured and dead may signal the crossing of a new threshold from multi-casualty events to the use of weapons of mass destruction. Consequently, the medical and healthcare infrastructure must be able to prevent and treat illness and injury resulting from such events. Thus, a first step in improving the preparation for and responses to such events must include a sustained commitment to training physicians, nurses, identification specialists, pathologists, and other first responders. The rapid spread of SARS gives reason to believe that the distribution of such agents has potential advantages over the use of other weapons. Investments in the public health and healthcare systems provide the best defense against terrorism.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also called infectious atypical pneumonia, is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel variant of coronavirus (SARS-associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV). It is mainly characterized by pulmonary infection with a high infectivity and fatality. SARS is swept across almost all the continents of the globe, and has currently involved 33 countries and regions, including the mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, North America and Europe. On June 30, 2003, an accumulative total reached 8450 cases with 810 deaths. SARS epidemic was very rampant in March, April and May 2003 in the mainland of China and Hong Kong. Chinese scientists and healthcare workers cooperated closely with other scientists from all over the world to fight the disease. On April 16, 2003, World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared that SARS-CoV was an etiological agent of SARS. Currently, there is no specific and effective therapy and prevention method for SARS. The main treatments include corticosteroid therapy, anti-viral agents, anti-infection, mechanical ventilation and isolation. This disease can be prevented and controlled, and it is also curable. Under the endeavor of the Chinese Government, medical staffs and other related professionals, SARS has been under control in China, and Chinese scientists have also made a great contribution to SARS research. Other studies in developing new detection assays and therapies, and discovering new drugs and vaccines are in progress. In this paper, we briefly review the current status of SARS in China.},

abstract = {It has been proved that severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus, a novel coronavirus. SARS originated in Guangdong Province, the People's Republic of China at the end of 2002. At present, it has spread to more than 33 countries or regions all over the world and affected 8 360 people and killed 764 by May 31,2003. Identification of the SARS causative agent and development of a diagnostic test are important. Detecting disease in its early stage, understanding its pathways of transmission and implementing specific prevention measures for the disease are dependent upon swift progress. Due to the efforts of the WHO-led network of laboratories testing for SARS, tests for the novel coronavirus have been developed with unprecedented speed. The genome sequence reveals that this coronavirus is only moderately related to other known coronaviruses. WHO established the definitions of suspected and confirmed and probable cases. But the laboratory tests and definitions are limited. Until now, the primary measures included isolation, ribavirin and corticosteroid therapy, mechanical ventilation, etc. Other therapies such as convalescent plasma are being explored. It is necessary to find more effective therapy. There still are many problems to be solved in the course of conquering SARS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel infectious disease with global impact. A virus from the family Coronaviridae has been identified as the cause, but the pathogenesis is still unclear. METHODS: Post-mortem tissue samples from six patients who died from SARS in February and March, 2003, and an open lung biopsy from one of these patients were studied by histology and virology. Only one full autopsy was done. Evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human metapneumovirus was sought by reverse-transcriptase PCR and serology. Pathological samples were examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. FINDINGS: All six patients had serological evidence of recent infection with SARS-CoV. Diffuse alveolar damage was common but not universal. Morphological changes identified were bronchial epithelial denudation, loss of cilia, and squamous metaplasia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia was present in one case. A giant-cell infiltrate was seen in four patients, with a pronounced increase in macrophages in the alveoli and the interstitium of the lung. Haemophagocytosis was present in two patients. The alveolar pneumocytes also showed cytomegaly with granular amphophilic cytoplasm. The patient for whom full autopsy was done had atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells corresponding to coronavirus. INTERPRETATION: SARS is associated with epithelial-cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung. The presence of haemophagocytosis supports the contention that cytokine dysregulation may account, at least partly, for the severity of the clinical disease. The case definition of SARS should acknowledge the range of lung pathology associated with this disease.},

abstract = {The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is the first severe and easily transmissible disease to emerge in the 21st century. It is caused by the infection with a coronavirus, a single strand RNA capsulated virus, recently found in a small mammalian, the masked palm civet. It is likely to represent the source of human infection. The first cases of SARS have been reported in the Chinese province of Guangdong and, since then, probable cases have been reported world wide. The clinical picture is characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as fever, cough or dyspnea in patients affected by air-space opacities (unifocal involvement in the 54.6{\%} of cases) or distress respiratory syndrome and linked to a recent exposure to a SARS case or to a travel/residence in an affected area. The empirical therapy is based on broad-spectrum antibiotics, steroids and ribavirin, but susceptibility testing have failed to demonstrate direct anti-viral activity of ribavirin against SARS-related coronavirus in vitro. The exposure to respiratory droplets and the contact with biologic fluids (respiratory and gastrointestinal secretions) represent the most efficient transmission modality of the SARS-related coronavirus. Hand hygiene is the most simple and cost effective measure of infection control to prevent contagion, and the use of airborne, contact and droplet precaution is strictly recommended to all health care workers taking care of such patients. The spread of SARS, to less developed country with limited resource for public health programs, represent the emerging alarming threat in the new global scenario.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An epidemic of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. RESULTS: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. CONCLUSION: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.},

The source of the outbreak was later traced to an individual with SARS who spent two nights at Amoy Gardens. Official explanations failed to account for the large number of residents infected over a wide area within a short time. A powerful environmental mechanism that efficiently amplified and distributed the causal agent must have been at work to cause this outbreak. One such mechanism could be an animal vector, most probably roof rats, that was infected by the index patient and subsequently spread the disease to more than 150 households.},

A recent community outbreak in Hong Kong infected a significant number of pregnant women who subsequently required emergency caesarean section for deteriorating maternal condition and respiratory failure. As no neonatal clinician has any experience in looking after these high risk infants, stringent infection control measures for prevention of cross infection between patients and staff are important to safeguard the wellbeing of the work force and to avoid nosocomial spread of SARS within the neonatal unit. This article describes the infection control and patient triage policy of the neonatal unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. We hope this information is useful in helping other units to formulate their own infection control plans according to their own unit configuration and clinical needs.},

Laboratory studies of SARS patients in a number of countries identified the etiologic agent being a novel member of coronaviridae. High RNA concentrations of this virus in sputum make it as a highly infectious agent. Low concentrations of viral genome are also detectable in feces. Coronaviruses are ubiquitos. They cause disease in many animals including pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, and chickens. These viruses have been associated with upper respiratory infections and sometimes pneumonia in humans. SARS presents with fever, cough, malaise, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. Chest radiographs from affected regions are associated with progressive airway disease. Clinical laboratory features of SARS include lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Currently, there is no FDA approved pharmacologic treatment for SARS. To date, no convincing clinical data is available for treatment of SARS with ribavirin. While there are some controversies about the use of systemic corticosteroids, Martin et al, in this issue of MSM, present their views on the use of pentoxyfylline (PTX) as a potential agent to be considered for SARS treatment.

Findings made with archetypal allosteric agents such as gallamine, alcuronium, and bis(ammonio)alkane-type agents revealed that binding of orthosteric ligands that attach to the acetylcholine site can be allosterically decreased or increased or left unaltered in a subtype-selective fashion. Analyses of structure/activity relationships (SARs) help to elucidate the molecular events underlying the allosteric action and they may pilot the development of new allosteric agents with improved properties and therapeutic perspectives. With a focus on SARs, this review illustrates the principles of muscarinic allosteric interactions, gives an overview of SARs in congeners of archetypal allosteric agents, and considers the topology of M(2) muscarinic allosteric interactions that are characterized by divergent binding modes.},

METHODS: Forty-one medical care workers (aged 23 - 55 years, with a average of 32 years; men/women = 8/32) who were admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with SARS during March and April, 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Thirteen of all the patients were physicians and the rest were nurses. The disease was mainly transmitted through air droplet in a short distance, and overwork induced tiredness was involved in disease stimulation. Seventy-three percent of the patients presented fever as their first symptom. Ten patients complained inertia and myalgia. One patient showed no clinical symptoms, and bilateral infiltrates was found in his chest X-ray. Among the 41 cases, 6 (15{\%}) were diagnosed as severe type. At the first week, the counts of white blood cells (WBCs), lymphocyte and platelets were (4.4 +/- 1.5) x 10(9)/L, 0.22 +/- 0.12 and (143 +/- 37) x 10(9)/L, which were significantly lower when compared with those at the 2nd to 4th week. Abnormal liver function was found in 27 cases (mostly with elevated serum ALT), with 70{\%} occurred at the 3rd or 4th week. In terms of CT, 30 patients (73{\%}) showed pathological changes in lungs, and bilateral lung involvement was found in 35.59{\%}. Of 36 cases treated with steroids, 86{\%} received middle or low dosage (80 - 240 mg/d). Artificial ventilation was used for twenty-seven patients, and air pipe mechanical ventilation was used for 1 case. Mortality in this study was 5{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Inertia and myalgia may be the earlier symptoms of health care workers with SARS include, which are parallel to CT manifestations. There is no objective index for the assessment of the severity of the disease at early stage. The medicine associated toxicities may be the main reason of liver lesions. damages. Middle or low dosage of steroid was reasonable to be used as early as possible.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of glucocorticoid in the treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Clinical data of 70 patients with SARS admitted to Youan Hospital in Beijing during March to May, 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Sixty-three of 70 cases of SARS recovered and seven cases died, with a case-fatality ratio of 10{\%}. (2) Average length of hospital stay was 16.9 days for the all 70 cases, and 16.8 days for the 11 cases without glucocorticoid treatment, without statistical significance (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). (3) The other 59 cases were administered with 40 mg to 640 mg of methylprednisolone daily. (4) Average hospital stay was 15 days for the 23 cases with lower dose of 40 mg to 80 mg methylprednisolone daily, 18.5 days for the 27 cases with medium dose of 120 mg to 240 mg daily, and 17.9 days for the nine cases with higher dose of 320 mg to 640 mg daily (F = 1.018, P = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Earlier use of glucocorticoid therapy with suitable doses could alleviate their clinical symptoms, improve their clinical courses, and promote the absorbance of infiltration in their lungs on chest-X-ray films for the cases with SARS. However, current clinical data showed that glucocorticoid therapy could not shorten the length of hospitalization for the cases with SARS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological characteristics and related factors of SARS in Shanxi in order to provide scientific basis for prevention and control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Data on clinically-diagnosed SARS cases reported to Shanxi Center for Disease Control and Prevention through SARS reporting system of Shanxi province and epidemiological reports were collected from early March to 20 May, 2003. The characteristics of SARS distribution in time, place and population in Shanxi were described. The epidemiological characteristics and related influential factors were analyzed with EPI info 6.0 software. RESULTS: Since the first imported SARS case was diagnosed clinically on 7 March and till 20 May in Shanxi province, the number of cumulative clinically-diagnosed SARS cases were 445 with an attack rate of 1.34/10,000. 20 deaths occurred in that period with the mortality rate 4.49{\%}. The number of cases increased from 28 March and formed the first peak. However, the number continued to increase until 18 April to have formed the second peak. Since then, the number of cases has gradually decreased gradually. Since 19 May, there has been no clinically-diagnosed cases being reported. SARS cases were mostly seen in urban areas of the city (83.82{\%} of the total SARS cases) with sporadic cases found in rural areas. Students and medical staff and people from 20 - 59 years of age occupied the large part of the cases. Age specific mortality rate increased with age and the male/female ratio was 1:0.87. CONCLUSION: In Shanxi province, the SARS epidemic seemed to have had the following stages: importation of the first case, gradual increase of the number of cases to reach the peak and decreasing. Case identification at early stage as well as taking measures to decrease the chance of transmission were strategically crucial for controlling the spread of SARS virus in the community.},

Mean specific absorption rates (SARs) ranged from 0 to 10 W/kg, and the temperature within the cultures was maintained at 37.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C for the duration of the 24-h exposure period. No significant differences in primary DNA damage were observed between the sham-treated controls and any of the CW or PW 1.9 GHz RF-field-exposed cultures when processed immediately after the exposure period by the alkaline comet assay. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of micronuclei, incidence of micronucleated binucleated cells, frequency of binucleated cells, or proliferation index between the sham-treated controls and any of the CW or PW 1.9 GHz RF-field-exposed cultures. In conclusion, the current study found no evidence of 1.9 GHz RF-field-induced genotoxicity in human blood cell cultures after a 24-h exposure period.},

In this article we report the synthesis and anti-VZV activity of a series of halophenyl analogues, with variation in the nature (F, Cl, Br) and location (o, m, p) of the halogen substituent. The compounds show a range of activities from ca. 10 nM to {\textgreater} 50 microM. In most cases, ortho substitution leads to greatest activity, meta substitution is in general poor, and the effect of p-substitution shows a marked dependence on the halogen atom. The p-fluorophenyl compound is unique amongst compounds of this class in being inactive as an antiviral. The possible origins of these marked SARs are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, which began on Mar. 7, 2003, resulted in extraordinary public health and infection control measures. We aimed to describe the psychological and occupational impact of this event within a large hospital in the first 4 weeks of the outbreak and the subsequent administrative and mental health response. METHODS: Two principal authors met with core team members and mental health care providers at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, to compile retrospectively descriptions of the experiences of staff and patients based on informal observation. All authors reviewed and analyzed the descriptions in an iterative process between Apr. 3 and Apr. 13, 2003. RESULTS: In a 4-week period, 19 individuals developed SARS, including 11 health care workers. The hospital's response included establishing a leadership command team and a SARS isolation unit, implementing mental health support interventions for patients and staff, overcoming problems with logistics and communication, and overcoming resistance to directives. Patients with SARS reported fear, loneliness, boredom and anger, and they worried about the effects of quarantine and contagion on family members and friends. They experienced anxiety about fever and the effects of insomnia. Staff were adversely affected by fear of contagion and of infecting family, friends and colleagues. Caring for health care workers as patients and colleagues was emotionally difficult. Uncertainty and stigmatization were prominent themes for both staff and patients. INTERPRETATION: The hospital's response required clear communication, sensitivity to individual responses to stress, collaboration between disciplines, authoritative leadership and provision of relevant support. The emotional and behavioural reactions of patients and staff are understood to be a normal, adaptive response to stress in the face of an overwhelming event.},

CO(2) inhalation (maximum tracheal CO(2) concentration ranging from 9 to 12{\%}) for approximately 60 s decreased the impulse activity of deflationary SARs but had no significant effect on tracheal pressure (P(T)) as an index of bronchomotor tone. Acetazolamide treatment (20 mg/kg) diminished the inhibitory response of deflationary SARs to CO(2) inhalation. 4-AP (0.7 and 2.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the decrease in deflationary SAR activity induced by CO(2) inhalation. When comparing the maximum attenuation due to 4-AP (2.0 mg/kg) and acetazolamide (20 mg/kg) in CO(2)-induced deflationary SAR inhibition, blockade of K(+) channels had a more pronounced effect. These results suggest that inhibition of deflationary SARs by CO(2) inhalation may be largely mediated by the stimulating action of 4-AP-sensitive K(+) currents in the nerve terminals of the receptors.},

Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted viral proteins indicates that the virus does not closely resemble any of the three previously known groups of coronaviruses. The genome sequence will aid in the diagnosis of SARS virus infection in humans and potential animal hosts (using polymerase chain reaction and immunological tests), in the development of antivirals (including neutralizing antibodies), and in the identification of putative epitopes for vaccine development.},

abstract = {In searching the Staphylococcus aureus genome, we previously identified sarT, a homolog of sarA, which encodes a repressor for alpha-hemolysin synthesis. Adjacent but transcribed divergently to sarT is sarU, which encodes a 247-residue polypeptide, almost twice the length of SarA. Sequence alignment disclosed that SarU, like SarS, which is another SarA homolog, could be envisioned as a molecule with two halves, with each half being homologous to SarA. SarU, as a member of the SarA family proteins, disclosed conservation of basic residues within the helix-turn-helix motif and within the beta hairpin loop, two putative DNA binding domains within this protein family. The transcription of sarU is increased in a sarT mutant. Gel shift and transcriptional fusion studies revealed that SarT can bind to the sarU promoter region, probably acting as a repressor for sarU transcription. The expression of RNAII and RNAIII of agr is decreased in a sarU mutant. As RNAIII expression is up-regulated in a sarT mutant, we hypothesize that sarT may down regulate agr RNAIII expression by repressing sarU, a positive activator of agr expression. We propose that, in addition to the quorum sensing effect of the autoinducing peptide of agr, the sarT-sarU pathway may represent a secondary amplification loop whereby the expression of agr (e.g., those found in vivo) might repress sarT, leading to increased expression of sarU. Elevated sarU expression would result in additional amplification of the original agr signal.},

METHODS: The appearing time, site, range and imaging features of pulmonary lesions in chest radiograms were observed in 118 patients with clinically confirmed SARS treated in our hospital. Meanwhile, their relation to clinical manifestations was also evaluated. RESULTS: Abnormal image appeared in the radiogram in 99.2{\%} of the patients, and it was found in 79.7{\%} of the patients within 4 days after onset of SARS. Lesions in both lungs and multi-lobe pathological changes were noted in 52.2{\%} of the patients. In seven non-survivors, the lesions were included multi-lung lobes, revealing earlier appearance and faster progression compared with the others. CONCLUSION: The more serious clinical symptoms and poor prognosis are found in patients with earlier appearance, larger scope and faster progression of SARS lesions in the chest radiogram.},

The chest film features and site of lung involvement were studied in early stage, most severe stage and recovery stage. The sequential chest film were evaluated hemiquantitatively. The correlation between the score of lung involvement and clinical course was also studied. RESULTS: The lung involvement was most common in lower lung field and outer zone both in early and acute stage. 91.3{\%} cases had bilateral involvement and 91.2{\%} had multifield involvement (two lung fields involvement is 47.8{\%}, three and four lung fields involvement are both 21.7{\%}). The ill-defined and variable opacities showed to be dominant. The improvement of acute stage lesion in 17 cases is related to the usage and increased dosage of corticosteroid, some cases showed non-parallel with symptom and chest X-ray. Hemiquantitative analysis showed there are 6 cases had second peak in X ray, the mean time of onset is 13.2 days, and lasted for 5.8 days. CONCLUSION: The chest X ray of SARS has some features and its changes can reflect the clinical situation.},

We report here identification of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ANPEP, encoding human aminopeptidase N, in Chinese. All ANPEP exons and their flanking intronic sequences were amplified from unrelated normal individuals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Nine SNPs were revealed after direct sequencing of PCR amplified fragments which showed changes of DHPLC chromatogram. Four of these polymorphisms, T321M(962C {\textgreater} T), S651L(1952C {\textgreater} T), S752N(2255G {\textgreater} A) and G764R(2290G {\textgreater} A), were non-synonymous; the remaining exonic synonymous and intronic ones were T795T(2385C {\textgreater} T), IVS7 + 17G {\textgreater} A, IVS14-16A {\textgreater} G, IVS17 + 12C {\textgreater} G and IVS17 + 44C {\textgreater} T.

abstract = {A previously healthy patient was transferred to our infectious department with a 9-day-history of continued fever. The patient was placed on assisted respiration support in addition to anti-viral medication. The diagnosis of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was made in view of the severe hypoxemia and the characteristic symptoms exhibited by the patient. Despite the best intensive therapy, he clinically deteriorated into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including additional dysfunction of kidney, liver, and heart. We initiated MARS therapy (extracorporeal liver support utilizing albumin dialysis) with intention to positively influence the organ functions in his MODS on the basis of recently published studies which suggested a positive impact of MARS in multiorgan failure secondary to respiratory illnesses and the possible influence on inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The application of 4 intermittent MARS treatments (8 h each, mean blood flow rate 180 ml/min) on 4 consecutive days resulted in an immediate improvement of clinical conditions within the treatment days. The further improvement of organ functions allowed withdrawing the patient from ventilatory support 13 days after start of MARS, and 44 days after admission he was discharged home with completely resolved organ functions and laboratory abnormalities. SARS is a severe form of the epidemic outbreak of atypical pneumonia which remains poorly defined regarding etiology and special therapy recommendations. However, the development and aggravation of this ARDS-like severe acute respiratory syndrome is pathologically associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which may then mediate or cause MODS. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an application of MARS therapy in MODS which was probably induced by SARS in a patient in China which improved the clinical condition of the patient in multi-organ failure secondary to respiratory failure indicating that MARS might be an additional therapeutic option in multiorgan failure induced by SARS.},

Human coronavirus 229E had been studied well and its receptor-binding domain was restricted to aa417-547 of S protein. However, this region has no homology with the newly separated SARS-associated virus (Hong Kong isolate CUHK-W1). Then we analyzed the phylogenesis of S1 subunit of the coronavirus spike protein (SARS-associated virus, Hong Kong isolate CUHK-W1). Interestingly, the highest homology between murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and SARS-associated coronavirus was found. And the important sites (aa62-65 and aa214-216) on the spike protein of MHV with receptor-binding capacity were highly conservative in comparison with the newly separated SARS-associated virus (the corresponding sites are aa51-54 and aal95-197). These results from bioinformatics analysis might help us to study the receptor-binding sites of SARS-associated virus and the mechanism of the virus entry into the target cell, and design antiviral drugs and potent vaccines.},

Among them, 13 patients were having serious primary diseases, i.e. cardio-cerebral-vascular disease in 9 patients, diabetes in 2 patients, renal dysfunction in 1 patient, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 1 patient. The treatment included antiviral agents, glucocorticoid, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics and immunologic enhancement, etc. Cure rate, mortality and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 32 patients, 24 were cured, 2 died of respiratory failure, 6 died of their primary diseases, and the overall mortality was 25.00 percent. Superimposed infection occurred in 12 patients, and among 17 patients who required noninvasive ventilation, 3 patients were complicated by lung injury (mediastinal emphysema, pneumothorax). In addition, hyperglycemia was found in 4 patients, upper intestinal hemorrhage occurred in another 4 patients and cardiac failure occurred in 6 patients. CONCLUSION: The treatment of the pre-existing diseases should be emphasized in the treatment of critical SARS. Glucocorticoid should not be used for a long-term. Vigilance should be paid to avoid lung injury during mechanical ventilation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore clinical and chest X-ray features of SARS in children to facilitate correct diagnosis. METHODS: Clinical manifestations and chest X-ray findings in five children suffering from SARS admitted for treatment in the hospital between February and May, 2003 in Shenzhen area were analyzed. The diagnosis was confirmed by epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological examinations. Among the 5 cases, 1 was a boy and the others were girls at the age of 4 to 13 years. RESULTS: Of the 5 SARS children, 3 presented a history of close contact with SARS patients. Fever was the initiative symptom, 4 had a body temperature of over 38 degrees C with the highest being 40 degrees C; fever sustained from 4 to 7 days with an average of 5.6 days. All the 5 cases developed nonproductive cough; on auscultation, both moist and dry rales could be heard in 3 out of the 5 cases. Mean total white count of peripheral blood was (2.96 - 6.9) x 10(9)/L, and was {\textless} 5.0 x 10(9)/L in 4 cases. SARS associated coronavirus specific RNA fragment was found positive by RT-PCR in 1 case; 1 case was positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies to the virus; 1 case was positive for only IgM antibody and another 2 cases were positive for only IgG antibody. IgG and IgM antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae as well as blood culture for bacteria were all negative. Findings on chest X-ray examination: 4 cases showed presence of patchy or macular opacities with cord-like shadows in unilateral lung plates while 1 case each showed ground-glass-like opacity and migratory changes; 1 case showed interstitial changes in the lungs in the form of irregular reticular lattice and cord-like shadows. Two cases received CT scanning and macular-patchy or spotty shadows were seen all over the lung. The shortest time for absorption of foci in the lungs was 7 days while the longest was 33 days with a mean of 15 +/- 6 days. None of the cases had any signs of fibrosis in the lungs. All the 5 cases were completely cured and discharged 7 to 40 days (mean 18 +/- 11 days) after admission. CONCLUSION: Compared with adult cases with SARS, children with SARS had milder symptoms and signs. Presence of unilateral patchy shadow in lungs represented the main chest X-ray findings.},

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted among 52 clinically confirmed SARS patients from February 9 to May 10, 2003. Chest X-ray scanning was performed at a interval of 1 - 3 days according to the requirements. The manifestations and special features of SARS in X-ray were analyzed. RESULTS: Small or large patchy shadows with intensive density in both lungs were observed in 31 cases, ground-glass like opacification in 16, small patchy shadows in one lung lobe or one lung segment in 18, nodular shadows in one lung segment in 1, and increased lung marking in lung interstitial tissues in 2. Rapidly changing consolidations revealed in chest X-ray images were found to be associated with SARS infections, and they were not affected by treatment with antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Chest X-ray provides a sensitive and specific method for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS, and those present with symptoms and signs should undergo chest X-ray scanning every 1 - 3 days.},

METHODS: A total of 80 clinically diagnosed SARS patients was enrolled in this study. RESULTS: The result showed that 72/80 patients had exposed to SARS patient, and the least contact time was only 20 minutes, the average incubation period was (7.6 +/- 4.3) days (range 2 to 20 days); 53 (66.3{\%}) subjects were hospital stuffs in this group, and 92.5{\%} hospital stuffs (49/53) and 85.2{\%} non-hospital stuffs (23/27) had the history of direct contact with SARS patients, respectively. The incubation period for the hospital stuffs and non-hospital stuffs were similar. More nurses (54.7{\%}) were infected than doctors (34{\%}) and nurse assistance (11.3{\%}). The lack of isolation and self-protection was the most important factor for the hospital infection, and early isolation could efficiently prevent the spread of the disease. CONCLUSION: Close exposure was the most important way for the transmission of SARS and the aggregation of the disease is common. The incubation period was around 7 days. The efficient isolation and self-protection could reduce the infection and prevent the spread of the disease.},

abstract = {The Annual Bio-Ontologies meeting (http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ stevens/meeting03/) has now been running for 6 consecutive years, as a special interest group (SIG) of the much larger ISMB conference. It met in Brisbane, Australia, this summer, the first time it was held outside North America or Europe. The bio-ontologies meeting is 1 day long and normally has around 100 attendees. This year there were many fewer, no doubt a result of the distance, global politics and SARS. The meeting consisted of a series of 30 min talks with no formal peer review or publication. Talks ranged in style from fairly formal and complete pieces of work, through works in progress, to the very informal and discursive. Each year's meeting has a theme and this year it was 'ontologies, and text processing'. There is a tendency for those submitting talks to ignore the theme completely, but this year's theme obviously struck a chord, as half the programme was about ontologies and text analysis (http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ stevensr/meeting03/programme.html). Despite the smaller size of the meeting, the programme was particularly strong this year, meaning that the tension between allowing time for the many excellent talks, discussion and questions from the floor was particular keenly felt. A happy problem to have!},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and find out its effective treatment. METHODS: A total of 106 cases of SARS were analyzed prospectively. RESULTS: In this group, 56 were male and 50 female, aged from 15 to 81 years [average (36 +/- 10) years]. Common symptoms included fever (98.1{\%}), chills (75.5{\%}), cough (71.7{\%}), headache and breathless (both 43.4{\%}), diarrhea (24.5{\%}) and rare rales in the lungs (11.2{\%}). Laboratory test showed leukopenia (34.0{\%}), lymphopenia (81.1{\%}) and an extraordinary decrease of CD(4)(+) T cells (98.1{\%}). Other rare abnormalities included liver injury (elevated alanine aminotransferase in 7.6{\%}) and thrombocytopenia (3.8{\%}). Almost all patients suffered from hypoxemia (PaO(2) less than 90 mm Hg in 90.2{\%}, less than 70 mm Hg in 28.6{\%}). Chest radiographs showed that unilateral focal patchy involvement in 34.0{\%} of the patients, and unilateral multifocal or bilateral involvement were 11.3{\%} and 46.2{\%} respectively. Treatment regimens included small doses of steroids (methylprednisolone 40-80 mg, q12 h recommended) accompanied with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as the second generation of cephalosporins and macrolides and some other antiviral drugs. Meanwhile, emphasis was placed on oxygen support and coping with their underlying diseases. CONCLUSIONS: SARS has various presentations of clinical features and laboratory tests. Detection of CD(4)(+) T cell count is beneficial to diagnose SARS in early stage. Effective treatment includes various regimens, oxygen support and small doses of steroids.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of clinical nutritional support in critical SARS patients, and the relationship between blood glucose levels/insulin administration amount and outcome. METHODS: Twenty-one SARS patients who reached the standard of Ministry of Health's "critical level" were transferred into our ICU in an average of 11 days after onset and enrolled in this clinical trial. All patients underwent respiratory support and clinical nutrition support as scheduled. For about 60 kg patient per day 3347.2 kJ(800 kcal), 36 g protein, and 125 g carbohydrate was given intravenously; 4184 kJ(1000 kcal), 38 g protein, and 125 g carbohydrate was provided by enteral route. MCT/LCT as fat resource shared 50{\%} calories intake. All patients received similar doses of intravenous Methylprednisolone(about 200 mg/d). Blood glucose, serum albumin, blood lymphocyte counts, and serum alanine transminase (ALT) were checked on the first admission day in ICU and on the 12th day after nutrition therapy was started. Insulin was started to pump in to maintain the blood glucose levels between 4.44-7.78 mmol/L (80-140 mg/dl) when the levels exceeded normal range. RESULTS: Upon admission into ICU, all patients had poor nutrients intake for an average of 11 days and 16 patients (76.2{\%}) were diagnosed as malnutrition. Parenteral and enteral nutrition therapy were then offered for an average of 12 days. On the 12th day, the serum albumin increased [(28.5 +/- 2.2)] g/L vs (37.0 +/- 4.1) g/L] (P = 0.0001) and so did the lymphocytes count [(0.74 +/- 0.47)] x 10(9)/L vs (1.22 +/- 0.73) x 10(9)/L] (P = 0.02). The blood glucose maintained at lower level in the surviving patients when compared with those who died [(9.5 +/- 2.3) mmol/L vs (6.3 +/- 1.8) mmol/L] [(196 +/- 70) mg/dl vs (110 +/- 21) mg/dl] (P = 0.0002), and the abnormally high ALT levels presented in some of the patients decreased but not significantly (81.0{\%} vs 57.1{\%}) (P = 0.18). In order to keep blood glucose within the range 4.44-7.78 mmol/L (80-140 mg/dl), only 18.8{\%} of the surviving patients needed insulin intervention as opposed to 80.0{\%} of those who died (P = 0.03). The amount of insulin used in the surviving group was significant lower than that in the group who died [(24 +/- 2) IU/d vs (72 +/- 9) IU/d] (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Eleven days after SARS onset, most of the critical patients presented with malnutrition. Some improved nutrition related parameters may be associated with clinical nutritional support. The surviving patients required less insulin when compared to those who died. 80.0{\%} of the patients who died need insulin versus only 18.8{\%} of the surviving patients. Due to the difficulty of SARS management, this study was not a randomized controlled clinical trial. More clinical trials will be needed for checking the results of this investigation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the management of critical severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and possible risk factors for death. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with SARS referred to Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease (GIRD) between December 2002 and March 2003 were studied retrospectively. Paired t-test using statistical software SPSS 10.0 was employed to compare the respiratory frequency and pulse O(2) saturation (SpO(2)) before and after noninvasive ventilation with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the 33 patients. Among them, 18 patients who presented with SpO(2) of 90{\%} - 93{\%} at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min were further recorded for their SpO(2) during slight physical movement and CPAP. The possible death-related risk factors including age, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia were analyzed by the Mantel-Haenszel chi(2) test. RESULTS: The respiratory frequencies were significantly decreased and SpO(2) was improved in the 33 patients after one hour of noninvasive ventilation. The SpO(2) in the latter 18 patients fell during slight physical movement and improved one hour after CPAP (p {\textless} 0.01). The RRs of the five death predictors concerning thrombocytopenia, age ({\textgreater} 50 yrs, underlying diseases, leucocytosis, and lymphopenia were 25.83, 8.57, 6.40, 1.64, and 1.17, respectively, with the 95{\%} CI of 3.64 - 183.59, 1.94 - 37.83, 1.75 - 23.33, 0.38 - 7.05 and 0.16 - 8.48, respectively. Management with corticosteroids effectively ameliorated and suppressed the development of pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Noninvasive ventilation relieves dyspnea and SpO(2) in patients with critical SARS, and should also be employed in those with SpO(2) of 90{\%} - 93{\%} at rest under O(2) inhalation 5 L/min. Noninvasive as an add-on management may probably cut down on the dosage and duration of corticosteriod therapy. Among 5 possible risk factors, 3 were recognized as death-related, turning out to be thrombocytopenia, age ({\textgreater} 50 yrs) and underlying diseases.},

abstract = {A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). For all the SARS-CoV associated proteins derivated from the SARS-CoV genome, the physiochemical properties such as the molecular weight, isoelectric point and extinction coefficient of each protein were calculated. The transmembrane segments and subcellular localization (SubLocation) prediction and conserved protein motifs search against database were employed to analyze the function of SARS-CoV proteins. Also, the homology protein sequence alignment and evolutionary distance matrix calculation between SARS-CoV associated proteins and the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses were employed to identify the classification and phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. The results showed that SARS-CoV is a novel coronavirus which is different from any of the three previously known groups of coronviruses, but it is closer to Bo-CoV and MHV than to other coronaviruses. This study is in aid of experimental determination of SARS-CoV proteomics and the development of antiviral vaccine.},

Based on the experimental research, western medicine focuses on the histological and structural changes of the diseases. In order to probe the key mechanisms of the disease's occurrence and development, it tries to develop the therapy targeting the mechanism. Materialism is the academic characteristic of western medicine. Based on the differentiation of individual patient and comprehensive analysis of all manifestations, with the academic characteristic of dynamics and dialectics, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) focuses on the regulation and recovery of the body functions. Theoretically, materialism and dialectics are complementary to each other. Their combination and unity is the key point for the integration of TCM with western medicine in order to improve the clinical effectiveness and TCM development. Therefore, we must adhere to the principles of the evidence-based medicine, strengthen the integrated study on "disease" of western medicine and "syndrome" of TCM, insist on "materialism" and improve the understanding of the mechanism of Chinese herb formula, pay efforts on the clinical study of difficult and common hepatic diseases, in order to develop the integrated traditional and western medicine on liver diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the chest X-ray image features of patients with severe SARS. METHODS: Chest X-ray image features in 36 patients with severe SARS were retrospectively analyzed. The image characteristics were compared with those of 224 patients with common SARS. RESULTS: The important chest X-ray imaging features of 36 patients with severe SARS included small patch of infiltration (n = 27, 75.0{\%}), large patch of infiltration (n = 22, 61.1{\%}), large area of lung consolidation (n = 10, 27.3{\%}), interstitial lung lesion (n = 26, 72.2{\%}), ground-glass shadow (n = 28, 77.8{\%}), irregular linear opacity (n = 15, 41.7{\%}), diffuse lung lesion (n = 12, 33.3{\%}), with single lung involved (n = 9, 25.0{\%}), and both lungs involved (n = 32, 88.9{\%}). The rates of large patch of infiltration, large area of lung consolidation, ground-glass shadow, diffuse lung lesion and involvement of both lungs in patients with severe SARS were significantly higher than those in patients with common type of SARS (all P {\textless} 0.01). Out of the 11 severe SARS patients who died, nine had large area of ground-glass shadow with air bronchogram in both lungs before death. CONCLUSIONS: Large patch of infiltration, large area of consolidation, ground-glass shadow, diffuse lung lesion and involvement of both lungs were the main X-ray image characteristics of patients with severe SARS. Large area of ground-glass shadow with air bronchogram in both lungs indicated a bad prognosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors in the dead patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: The retrospective analyses were made on 12 dead cases and 32 recovered cases with SARS. RESULTS: The mean age was 67 years old in 12 dead cases with SARS and was 42 in recovered control group. There were 1-5 other basic diseases in 5 cases of death group. The states of dead patients were severe and the deterioration of patients' condition was rapid. The CD 4 and CD 8 T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were (416.6+/-235.0) cells/microl and (296.1+/-181.5)cells/microl in survival patients and (143.8+/-78.1)cells/microl, (103.6+/-63.2) cells/microl in dead patients, they often decreased compared to the normal values, especially in dead cases. Five cases were infected with bacteria in 12 dead cases, among them 3 were infected with fungus and 2 were septicemia. In dead group, the occurrence rates of electrolyte maladjustment and kidney injury were 41.67 percent. Invasive ventilation was used in 10 cases and death rate was 80.0 percent, among them 5 patients were infected with bacteria. None was dead in the patients with non-invasive ventilation. CONCLUSION: The age and basic diseases are the main mortal risk factors in SARS. Other risk factors include the decline of immune function, secondary infection, complications and use of invasive ventilation.},

Western analysis on the purified protein confirmed the expression and purification of the NC fusion proteins from yeast. To determine its antigenicity, the fusion protein was challenged with serum samples from SARS patients and normal controls. The NC fusion protein demonstrated high antigenicity with high specificity, and therefore, it should have great potential in designing clinical diagnostic tools and provide useful information for vaccine development.},

A total of 5,327 SARS cases were reported, with 348 deaths (Ministry of Health, 2003a). Although the Chinese government was criticised by the international community for underreporting at the early stages of the SARS epidemic (Editor CMAJ, 2003a), China eventually achieved remarkable success in combating SARS. This paper documents some aspects of the Chinese experience infighting against SARS, based on interviews with my Chinese colleagues, analysed with reference to government policy documents and published articles. My interviewees included health officials at the central, provincial and municipal levels and hospital managers who had been working in the frontline of the battle against SARS.},

In this study, two epitopes (N1 and N2) of the N protein of SARS-CoV were predicted by bioinformatics analysis. After immunization with two peptides, the peptides-specific antibodies were isolated from the immunized rabbits. The further experiments demonstrated that N1 peptide-induced polyclonal antibodies had a high affinity to bind to E. coli expressed N protein of SARS-CoV. Furthermore, it was confirmed that N1 peptide-specific IgG antibodies were detectable in the sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. The results indicated that an epitope of the N protein has been identified and N protein specific Abs were produced by peptide immunization, which will be usefull for the study of SARS-CoV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. During the Taiwan epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), many health care workers were infected. In an effort to establish a screening program for high risk personal, the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection. METHODS: HLA-class I and II allele typing by PCR-SSOP was performed on 37 cases of probable SARS, 28 fever patients excluded later as probable SARS, and 101 non-infected health care workers who were exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. An additional control set of 190 normal healthy unrelated Taiwanese was also used in the analysis. RESULTS: Woolf and Haldane Odds ratio (OR) and corrected P-value (Pc) obtained from two tails Fisher exact test were used to show susceptibility of HLA class I or class II alleles with coronavirus infection. At first, when analyzing infected SARS patients and high risk health care workers groups, HLA-B*4601 (OR = 2.08, P = 0.04, Pc = n.s.) and HLA-B*5401 (OR = 5.44, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s.) appeared as the most probable elements that may be favoring SARS coronavirus infection. After selecting only a "severe cases" patient group from the infected "probable SARS" patient group and comparing them with the high risk health care workers group, the severity of SARS was shown to be significantly associated with HLA-B*4601 (P = 0.0008 or Pc = 0.0279). CONCLUSIONS: Densely populated regions with genetically related southern Asian populations appear to be more affected by the spreading of SARS infection. Up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among Taiwan indigenous peoples who are genetically distinct from the Taiwanese general population, have no HLA-B* 4601 and have high frequency of HLA-B* 1301. While increase of HLA-B* 4601 allele frequency was observed in the "Probable SARS infected" patient group, a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the "Severe cases" patient group. These results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection in Asian populations. Independent studies are needed to test these results.},

abstract = {AIM OF STUDY: This study examined the level of knowledge of SARS transmission among Singaporeans and their willingness to disclose their health condition to others. We also examined respondents' perceived effects of SARS on work and organisations and their attitudes toward issues of privacy and disclosure of medical information. METHOD: Respondents comprised MBAs (Master of Business Administration students) and human resource managers who attended classes in a local tertiary institution. Data were collected via an email survey. A total of 101 completed surveys were received and included in data analyses. RESULTS: Results suggest that despite rather intensive efforts to generate awareness about SARS transmission, a certain level of uncertainty about how SARS can be transmitted still prevails. This is not surprising, given that SARS is a relatively new medical problem. Our findings also suggest that while respondents unanimously agreed that they would inform their parents, spouse, siblings and employers if they were tested positive for SARS, they were more ambivalent about disclosing such information to their neighbours and colleagues. Findings also suggest that having a SARS or probable SARS case in the company would disrupt the flow of work and affect employees' morale. CONCLUSION: Results of this study have significant implications for efforts to educate Singaporeans about the disease and the management of SARS at the workplace.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological findings and the experience in the prevention and control of SARS in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. METHOD: The outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong was reviewed. Relevant data was collected and epidemiological studies conducted. Preventive measures taken by the Government from the public health perspective were introduced. RESULT: Based on the results of epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of SARS typically ranges from 2 - 7 days, but can be over 10 day. Transmission of SARS is mainly through respiratory droplets, and contacts with objects contaminated with a patient's respiratory droplets and secretions. Most of the SARS patients are health care workers and close contacts of SARS patients. Outbreak control measures include: firstly, controlling the source of infection through early detection, early diagnosis, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment: secondly, break the chain of transmission: thirdly, protecting the vulnerable; and fourthly, dissemination of information. At the same time, specific measures which include health checks at border points, home confinement of contacts and school suspension were taken. All of these measures help contain the SARS outbreak. CONCLUSION: Prevention of infectious diseases calls for macro and integrated strategies as well as effective surveillance. Decisive and prompt actions are necessary to control epidemics.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study clinical characteristics of pediatric SARS cases in Beijing. METHODS: Eighteen pediatric cases with SARS diagnosed on admission were analyzed. The cases were admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital and Ditan Hospital (pediatric ward) from April 8 to May 12. RESULTS: The 18 children aged 5 months to 15 years (10 male and 8 female) had epidemiologically linked findings. Fourteen cases had close contact with SARS patients. Four cases were living in the community where adult SARS patients were found. All the 18 patients but one presented with fever and cough. Most of them had high fever, 2 cases had bradycardia, 2 had diarrhea, and another 2 had tachypnea. Malaise and headache were noted only in 3 cases respectively which were much less frequently seen than in adult patients. Symptoms and signs of the children were much less severe and aggressive than adults cases. Thirteen children had chest radiographic consolidation. Of them, 9 cases had progressive changes after admission, then improved quickly. We did not find significant lower hemoglobin and platelet levels. Most patients had leukopenia and lymphopenia. Serologic test was performed for 15 cases and 8 were positive for SARS virus-IgG and 6 for IgM antibody. Of the 4 cases who had close contact with SARS adults and without chest radiograph abnormal findings, 3 were negative for SARS virus-antibodies. Part of the patients had temporary abnormality of myocardial enzyme and liver function. All these children finally had rapid improvement on chest radiograph. The patients were treated with antiviral agents and corticosteroid. Only two cases required oxygen therapy. No child needed assisted ventilation and no death, nor lung fibrosis occurred. After hospitalization, all patients were improved and discharged when this paper was being written. The average hospital stay of these patients was 14.6 days (6 - 22 days). CONCLUSION: Compared with adults, pediatric SARS patients seemed to have their own clinical characteristics. The disease in children had lower severity and infectivity than that in adults. The mechanisms of the disease in children should be studied in well-designed clinical trials. Cases like the 4 children who had close contact with SARS adult patients but without chest radiographic changes deserve further studies with the help of more reliable and sensitive etiologic tests.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To observe the changes of serum interleukins (IL), T-lymphocyte subsets, and white blood cell (WBC) count in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to investigate the relationship between injured immune function, immune response and disturbed immune adjustment in SARS patients. METHODS: The levels of serum IL-2, IL-10, IL-12 and T-lymphocyte subset counts were measured in 35 clinically diagnosed SARS patients by using enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA). The relationship between the measured results and WBC count was further analyzed. RESULTS: The level of serum IL was increased to a great extent in the 35 SARS patients, and the levels of serum IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 were 242.53 (92.69) pg/ml, 77.43 (63.37) pg/ml and 65.94 (43.21) pg/ml, respectively. The level of serum IL-2 increased markedly (P {\textless} 0.01). The peripheral blood CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were lower than normal in 23 patients (67.7{\%}), 26 patients (74.3{\%}) and 15 patients (42.9{\%}), respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were lower than 4.0 x 10(9)/L in 10 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 583.90 (315.58) x 10(6)/L, 272.00 (94.13) x 10(6)/L and 209.00 (72.21) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were (4.0 - 10.0) x 10(9)/L in 20 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 700.00 (502.96) x 10(6)/L, 347.00 (247.58) x 10(6)/L and 322.05 (228.47) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The peripheral blood WBC counts were higher than 10.0 x 10(9)/L in 5 patients, and their CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were 1466.00 (630.86) x 10(6)/L, 783.00 (311.14) x 10(6)/L and 640.00 (294.40) x 10(6)/L, respectively. The decreased CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts were consistent with the decreased WBC counts. The level of IL in SARS patients was significantly higher than that in patients with chronic hepatitis B (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The level of serum IL is closely related to cell immunity in SARS patients. The level of serum IL is increased evidently while CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) counts decrease. Both serum IL and CD are associated with injury of immune function, and thus they could be regarded as a monitoring index for judging the condition of SARS patients and prescribing immune therapy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To realize the clinical characteristic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Observe the clinical signs and symptoms of each patients; do laboratory examination periodically; and at last do Stat analysis of all the cases. RESULTS: The first onset symptom of the 27 cases is high fever accompany with toxic symptom such as muscular soreness, headache, etc. The patient's condition may be most serious in the 2nd week. The amount of end-brush blood WBC decrease, especially the lymphocyte decrease more obviously. The amount of CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) decrease obviously is another important characteristic. The chest X-ray show pulmonary lesion in the 2nd day after onset of the illness, but 40.7{\%} cases show positive change after 6 days onset. During the 7 - 12 days the pulmonary lesion become most serious. Seven cases are treated by steroid in the first 3 days when the chest X-ray is normal, but they become positive during 6 - 8 days of the course. Whether the state of the illness is serious or not seems no obvious relationship to when they are treated by steroid. And large dosage of steroid may inhibit the level of CD(4)(+) and CD8 (P {\textless} 0.05). Two severe cases present double infection after large dosage of steroid. CONCLUSION: The course of a infectious atypical pneumonia is almost 3 weeks, the 1st week can be decided as early stage, the 2nd week is decided as fastigium, the 3rd week is decided as stage of recovery. During the fastigium, the disease transform very quickly, we need pay more attention to the patient. The CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patient decrease obviously, it seems the immuno-function inhibited seriously. The serious case is easily accompany with severe secondary infection in the late stage, so the use of steroid must be carefully and the dosage need not to be much more.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss the effect of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Thirty SARS patients were treated at our hospital for over 3 weeks since March to May 2003. The course and dosage of glucocorticoid, counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+), electrolytes, blood routine, and sera albumin before and after the treatment were analysed. RESULTS: Before treatment by methylprednisolone, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of 27 SARS patients were (401 +/- 203), (340 +/- 187), (756 +/- 383) cells/ microl. Twenty-nine of the 30 SARS patients were treated by methylprednisolone. The dosage for 24 patients was 80 - 160 mg/d with the largest being 1,000 mg/d before admission to the hospital. The count of WBC was increased after treatment (P {\textless} 0.01). No obvious effect was observed on the potassium, sodium and chlorine of blood (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Glucocorticoid increased the level of blood glucose (P = 0.01), decreased the level of sera albumin (P {\textless} 0.01), and its large dosage decreased the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+). Three severe patients had secondary infection after administration of a large dose of glucocorticoid. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of the disease, the counts of CD(4)(+), CD(8)(+) and CD(3)(+) of SARS patients may reduce markedly indicating the immunity is suppressed. A large dose of glucocorticoid may aggravate the suppression and make the body in an active metabolic state (the increase of blood glucose and the decrease of sera albumin). Thus the disease is aggravated and patients are likely to suffer from severe secondary infection. Indications for use of glucocorticoid must strictly controlled and its large dosage is improper.},

METHODS: Anti-coagulating blood samples from 98 SARS patients in the acute phase, 56 normal healthy blood donors, and from patients infected by HIV, CMV and EBV were collected. The T lymphocyte subsets were counted by flow cytometry using fluorescence-labeled specific monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in all SARS patients in their peripheral CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte absolute counts [256 (104) x 10(6)/L and 256 (117) x 10(6)/L, respectively], which were also lower than those of the patients infected with HIV, CMV and EBV. All patients infected with HIV, CMV and EBV had significantly higher CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts in comparison with normal controls. CONCLUSIONS: Decrease of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes of patients is related to onset of SARS. T lymphocyte subset analysis would help improve the early diagnosis of the disease.},

abstract = {The nucleocapsid protein (N protein) has been found to be an antigenic protein in a number of coronaviruses. Whether the N protein in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is antigenic remains to be elucidated. Using Western blot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the recombinant N proteins and the synthesized peptides derived from the N protein were screened in sera from SARS patients. All patient sera in this study displayed strong positive immunoreactivities against the recombinant N proteins, whereas normal sera gave negative immunoresponses to these proteins, indicating that the N protein of SARS-CoV is an antigenic protein. Furthermore, the epitope sites in the N protein were determined by competition experiments, in which the recombinant proteins or the synthesized peptides competed against the SARS-CoV proteins to bind to the antibodies raised in SARS sera. One epitope site located at the C-terminus was confirmed as the most antigenic region in this protein. A detailed screening of peptide with ELISA demonstrated that the amino sequence from Codons 371 to 407 was the epitope site at the C-terminus of the N protein. Understanding of the epitope sites could be very significant for developing an effective diagnostic approach to SARS.},

abstract = {The expression of virulence determinants in Staphylococcus aureus is controlled by global regulatory loci (e.g., sarA and agr). One of these determinants, protein A (spa), is activated by sarS, which encodes a 250-residue DNA-binding protein. Genetic analysis indicated that the agr locus likely mediates spa repression by suppressing the transcription of sarS. Contrary to SarA and SarR, which require homodimer formation for proper function, SarS is unusual within the SarA protein family in that it contains two homologous halves, with each half sharing sequence similarity to SarA and SarR. Here we report the 2.2 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the SarS protein. SarS has folds similar to those of SarR and, quite plausibly, the native SarA structure. Two typical winged-helix DNA-binding domains are connected by a well-ordered loop. The interactions between the two domains are extensive and conserved. The putative DNA-binding surface is highly positively charged. In contrast, negatively charged patches are located opposite to the DNA-binding surface. Furthermore, sequence alignment and structural comparison revealed that MarR has folds similar to those of SarR and SarS. Members of the MarR protein family have previously been implicated in the negative regulation of an efflux pump involved in multiple antibiotic resistance in many gram-negative species. We propose that MarR also belongs to the winged-helix protein family and has a similar mode of DNA binding as SarR and SarS and possibly the entire SarA protein family member. Based on the structural differences of SarR, SarS, and MarR, we further classified these winged-helix proteins to three subfamilies, SarA, SarS, and MarR. Finally, a possible transcription regulation mechanism is proposed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the process of SARS transmission and to evaluate infectivity of SARS patients in different periods of disease development. METHODS: A case of SARS outbreak beginning from a male, 74-year-old patient in Beijing. Two hundred and seventy five primary, secondary and tertiary contacts, including family members relatives, colleagues, and others exposed to him, were traced by field investigation and telephone interview using a standardized questionnaire. The transmission process and infectivity of disease were analyzed with transmission chain diagram and contact history diagram. RESULTS: Among the 275 contacts of the index case, 41 fell ill of SARS with an attack rate of 14.9{\%} and 5 deaths with a fatality rate of 12.2{\%}. The transmission chain of this outbreak could be clearly delineated, and all the 41 cases had close contacts with their infectors, SARS cases of the previous generation within the symptomatic period thereof. All of the 114 contacts that contacted their infectors, SARS cases of the previous generation during the incubation period thereof remained healthy. The incubation period of 27 cases that had contacted their infectors only once was 1 - 10 days with a median of 3 days. The highest risk of being infected was caring the patients unprotectedly, followed by living together with patient, visiting patient, and handling patient without protection. CONCLUSION: All the secondary cases have the history of close contact with their symptomatic infectors of previous generation. It cannot be proved at all that SARS is infective during the incubation period. The infectivity of SARS is related to the degree of closeness of contact with the patient.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the usage of corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS. METHODS: The usage of corticosteroids in 43 SARS patients were reviewed. The initial dosage and the highest dosage of prednisolone were investigated. RESULTS: According to the dosage of the early 3 days, the initial dosage was calculated. The initial methyprednisonlone dosage was (170.82 +/- 15.89) mg.d-1, from 48 to 500 mg.d-1. The maximal dosage was (291.44 +/- 37.63) mg.d-1 (48-800 mg.d-1). Four patients recovered without corticosteroides therapy. Initial therapy was kept in 25 cases. Two had hyperglycemia, one of whom died of hyperosmotic coma and renal failure. 14 cases were not responsive and needed to increase the dosage of corticosteroids. 9 of them accepted pulse dosage therapy and acquired good outcome. None in the group had significant side effect. The severity of patients of the two groups had no significant difference. Those of nonresponsiveness had higher dosage and needed longer time to reach stable. CONCLUSION: Sub-pulse dosage of methyprednisolone was effective for most SARS patients. Those who were less responsiveness might due to their poor sensitiveness to corticosteroids instead of SARS severity. Pulse treatment might be safe in carefully selected patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus genotype and its characteristics. METHODS: A SARS-associated coronavirus isolate named ZJ01 was obtained from throat swab samples taken from a patient in Hangzhou, Zhejing province. The complete genome sequence of ZJ01 consisted of 29,715 bp (GenBank accession: AY297028, version: gi: 30910859). Seventeen SARS-associated coronavirus genome sequences in GenBank were compared to analyze the common sequence variations and the probability of co-occurrence of multiple polymorphisms or mutations. Phylogenetic analysis of those sequences was done. RESULTS: By bioinformatics processing and analysis, the 5 loci nucleotides at ZJ01 genome were found being T, T, G, T and T, respectively. Compared with other SARS-associated coronavirus genomes in the GenBank database, an A/G mutation was detected besides the other 4 mutation loci (C:G:C:C/T:T:T:T) involved in this genetic signature. Therefore a new definition was put forward according to the 5 mutation loci. SARS-associated coronavirus strains would be grouped into two genotypes (C:G:A:C:C/T:T:G:T:T), and abbreviated as SARS coronavirus C genotype and T genotype. On the basis of this new definition, the ZJ01 isolate belongs to SARS-associated coronavirus T genotype, first discovered and reported in mainland China. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein gene fragments of these SARS-associated coronavirus strains showed that the GZ01 isolate was phylogenetically distinct from other isolates, and compared with groups F1 and F2 of the T genotype, the isolates of BJ01 and CUHK-W1 were more closely related to the GZ01 isolate. It was interesting to find that two (A/G and C/T) of the five mutation loci occurred in the spike protein gene, which caused changes of Asp to Gly and Thr to Ile in the protein, respectively. CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid to whether these genotype and mutation patterns are related to the virus's biological activities,epidemic characteristics and host clinical symptoms.},

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was employed to study the prevalence of SARS infection in medical workers who contacted with SARS patients directly. The data were analyzed with EPI statistic soft ware. RESULTS: From March 15th, 2003 to May 18th, 2003, 224 patients with clinical confirmed SARS and 72 patients with clinical suspected SARS were presented in our hospital. The principle and system of the isolation precautions were established and implemented in our hospital. Seven hundreds and twenty medical workers including doctors, nurses and nurse-assistants were involved in the medical care of patients with SARS. Eighteen out of the 720 (2.43{\%}) medical workers were infected with SARS, most of them were from the department of emergency, and the majority of infected medical workers were nurse-assistants. After the isolation precautions in hospital were established, the spreading of SARS in medical stuffs declined dramatically. The medical workers infected with SARS were 7.20{\%} of SARS patients presented or hospitalized in our hospital. The infection rate was significantly lower than that of the average rate in our country. CONCLUSION: The isolation precautions taken in our hospital was effective.},

abstract = {The corona-like spikes or peplomers on the surface of the virion under electronic microscope are the most striking features of coronaviruses. The S (spike) protein is the largest structural protein, with 1,255 amino acids, in the viral genome. Its structure can be divided into three regions: a long N-terminal region in the exterior, a characteristic transmembrane (TM) region, and a short C-terminus in the interior of a virion. We detected fifteen substitutions of nucleotides by comparisons with the seventeen published SARS-CoV genome sequences, eight (53.3{\%}) of which are non-synonymous mutations leading to amino acid alternations with predicted physiochemical changes. The possible antigenic determinants of the S protein are predicted, and the result is confirmed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with synthesized peptides. Another profound finding is that three disulfide bonds are defined at the C-terminus with the N-terminus of the E (envelope) protein, based on the typical sequence and positions, thus establishing the structural connection with these two important structural proteins, if confirmed. Phylogenetic analysis reveals several conserved regions that might be potent drug targets.},

METHODS: The data of the clinical presentations and course of disease in 77 epidemiologically linked patients (27 men and 50 women, 15 to 74 years old) in whom SARS was diagnosed after April 16, 2003 in Tianjin, China were summarized. RESULTS: Exposure to ailing patients and occurrence of the disease ranged from minimal to close contact, such as between patient and health care personnel. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 11 days. All patients presented fever, and some of them complained of rigor, dry cough, dyspnea, malaise, headache, and hypoxemia. Physical examination of the chest revealed bubbling rales and dullness on percussion. Lymphopenia was observed in 80{\%} of all patients, and some patients had mildly elevated aminotransferase levels but normal serum creatinine levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive inflammatory changes. One patient died of progressive respiratory failure; pathological examination of the lung showed diffuse alveolar damage. One patient died of suicide. There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. All patients received corticosteroid and ribavirin therapy for a mean of (18.6+/-5.4) days after the onset of symptoms, and were treated with a combination of beta-lactams and macrolide early for (4.0+/-1.9)days, but with no clinical or radiologic evidences of improvement.

abstract = {CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease with a 25{\%} incidence of progression to acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality exceeding 10{\%}. OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of ALI/ARDS in patients with SARS-related critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective case series of adult patients with probable SARS admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital in Singapore between March 6 and June 6, 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was 28-day mortality after symptom onset. RESULTS: Of 199 patients hospitalized with SARS, 46 (23{\%}) were admitted to the ICU, including 45 who fulfilled criteria for ALI/ARDS. Mortality at 28 days for the entire cohort was 20 (10.1{\%}) of 199 and for ICU patients was 17 (37{\%}) of 46. Intensive care unit mortality at 13 weeks was 24 (52.2{\%}) of 46. Nineteen of 24 ICU deaths occurred late ({\textgreater} or =7 days after ICU admission) and were attributed to complications related to severe ARDS, multiorgan failure, thromboembolic complications, or septicemic shock. ARDS was characterized by ease of derecruitment of alveoli and paucity of airway secretion, bronchospasm, or dynamic hyperinflation. Lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and higher baseline ratios of PaO2 to fraction of inspired oxygen were associated with earlier recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with SARS and ALI/ARDS had characteristic clinical findings, high rates of complications; and high mortality. These findings may provide useful information for optimizing supportive care for SARS-related critical illness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) worldwide. We report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 138 cases of suspected SARS during a hospital outbreak in Hong Kong. METHODS: From March 11 to 25, 2003, all patients with suspected SARS after exposure to an index patient or ward were admitted to the isolation wards of the Prince of Wales Hospital. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Clinical end points included the need for intensive care and death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: There were 66 male patients and 72 female patients in this cohort, 69 of whom were health care workers. The most common symptoms included fever (in 100 percent of the patients); chills, rigors, or both (73.2 percent); and myalgia (60.9 percent). Cough and headache were also reported in more than 50 percent of the patients. Other common findings were lymphopenia (in 69.6 percent), thrombocytopenia (44.8 percent), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase levels (71.0 percent and 32.1 percent, respectively). Peripheral air-space consolidation was commonly observed on thoracic computed tomographic scanning. A total of 32 patients (23.2 percent) were admitted to the intensive care unit; 5 patients died, all of whom had coexisting conditions. In a multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of an adverse outcome were advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.16 to 2.81; P=0.009), a high peak lactate dehydrogenase level (odds ratio per 100 U per liter, 2.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.28 to 3.42; P=0.003), and an absolute neutrophil count that exceeded the upper limit of the normal range on presentation (odds ratio, 1.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.03 to 2.50; P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: SARS is a serious respiratory illness that led to significant morbidity and mortality in our cohort.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is now a global challenge affecting more than 8000 patients in different continents. The dictum of public health practice especially for infectious disease is "prevention better than cure". It is especially true for SARS as the treatment strategies remain diverse and experimental. Maintaining a healthy and hygienic environment can be one of the effective public health measures to combat infectious disease. The major challenge is that some of the most important public health measures are to be taken outside the health sector. The community also needs to be strengthened and equipped with the health skills to promote better health and hygiene. There is also the need to create a supportive environment conducive to health for long term sustainability. The WHO approach of promoting health through setting approach would be one possible solution to face the challenge. This paper will describe some of the public health initiatives in Hong Kong through "setting approach" and "community development model" in helping the society fight against SARS. With the emergence of SARS, this might be the time to globalise public health medicine as an important component of medical practice.},

It has now been documented in 26 countries worldwide, with significant outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Toronto. Research into identifying the etiological agent, evaluating modes of disease transmission, and treatment options is currently ongoing. DISCUSSION: The disease can produce a severe bilateral pneumonia, with progressive hypoxemia. Up to 20{\%} of patients require mechanical ventilatory support, with a fatal outcome occurring in about 5{\%} of cases.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the morphological, ultramicrostructural and pathological changes of tissues from a patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: One autopsy case of diagnosed SARS was investigated. Lung puncture was performed immediately after the patient died, and the autopsy was done after 12 h. The specimens from lymph nodes, spleen, small intestine, colon and bone marrow were studied by immunohistochemical technique. The antibodies used included CD20, CD45RO (UCHL-1), CD4, CD8, CD68 and CD34. RESULTS: The principal lesions of the SARS case consisted of acute lobular intrastitial pneumonia, hyaloid membranes of pulmonic alveoli and hyperplasia and shedding of alveolar epithelium of. Virus-like inclusions occasionally contained cytoplasm of the alveolar epithelium, which were positive by histochemical staining. The adjacent blood-vessels were changed by hyperplasia and enlargement. The structures of lymph nodes and spleen were damaged with lymph follicles depletion and splenic nodules atrophy. The specific changes included reduction of lymphocytes and hyperplasia of histiocytes, depletion of the follicles of small intestine and colon wall, decreased hyperplasia of the bone marrow and increased number of the megakaryocyte. Meanwhile, in the immunohistochemical study, CD(20)(+) B cells were fully expressed in lymph nodes and spleen, and the CD45RO (UCHL-1)(+) T cells were scatteredly expressed. The number of CD4(+) help T cell was markedly decreased, while the number of CD8+ poisonal T cells increased, and the ratio of the former and latter was no more than 0.5. Under the electronic microscopy observation, virus-like particles with 80 - 160 nm diameter and halo or garland envelope were found in mononuclear macrophage and cytoplasm of alveolar epithelium. CONCLUSION: The specific lesions of SARS consist of lobular intrastitial pneumonia with the formation of hyaline membranes of lung, haemorrhage, necrosis, inflammation of blood vessels and the damages of extralung lymphohemopioetic system. The damages were very similar to the pathological features of tissues infected by human immunodeficiency virus, in which numbers of T cells decreased and CD(4)(+) T cell/CD(8)(+) T cell ratio was no more than 0.5. According to the virus-like particles found in lung of the SARS case, it is considered that these virus-like particles may be a new kind of coronavirus which caused the "atypical pneumonia".},

The etiology of SARS is likely a novel coronavirus. During the winter of 2003, an outbreak of SARS involving several hospitals occurred in Toronto, Canada. We describe a patient post liver transplant who contracted SARS and died during the outbreak, with subsequent infection of family and several health-care workers. A novel coronavirus was detected in respiratory specimens by PCR. Due to the potential severity of SARS in transplant recipients and the large number of cases of SARS in the community, in order to avoid transmission of SARS from a donor, we developed guidelines for SARS screening of organ donors. A screening tool based on potential hospital SARS exposure, clinical symptoms, and epidemiological exposure was used to stratify donors as high, intermediate or low risk for SARS. As SARS spreads throughout the world, it may become an increasingly significant problem for transplant patients and programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is associated with a newly discovered coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We did clinical and experimental studies to assess the role of this virus in the cause of SARS. METHODS: We tested clinical and postmortem samples from 436 SARS patients in six countries for infection with SARS-CoV, human metapneumovirus, and other respiratory pathogens. We infected four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with SARS-CoV in an attempt to replicate SARS and did necropsies on day 6 after infection. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV infection was diagnosed in 329 (75{\%}) of 436 patients fitting the case definition of SARS; human metapneumovirus was diagnosed in 41 (12{\%}) of 335, and other respiratory pathogens were diagnosed only sporadically. SARS-CoV was, therefore, the most likely causal agent of SARS. The four SARS-CoV-infected macaques excreted SARS-CoV from nose, mouth, and pharynx from 2 days after infection. Three of four macaques developed diffuse alveolar damage, similar to that in SARS patients, and characterised by epithelial necrosis, serosanguineous exudate, formation of hyaline membranes, type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, and the presence of syncytia. SARS-CoV was detected in pneumonic areas by virus isolation and RT-PCR, and was localised to alveolar epithelial cells and syncytia by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. INTERPRETATION: Replication in SARS-CoV-infected macaques of pneumonia similar to that in human beings with SARS, combined with the high prevalence of SARS-CoV infection in SARS patients, fulfill the criteria required to prove that SARS-CoV is the primary cause of SARS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the etiologic agent of this outbreak. METHODS: We received clinical specimens from patients in seven countries and tested them, using virus-isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to identify a wide range of potential pathogens. RESULTS: None of the previously described respiratory pathogens were consistently identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen. Electron-microscopical examination revealed ultrastructural features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from several locations, a finding consistent with a point-source outbreak. Indirect fluorescence antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays made with the new isolate have been used to demonstrate a virus-specific serologic response. This virus may never before have circulated in the U.S. population. CONCLUSIONS: A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. Because of the death of Dr. Carlo Urbani, we propose that our first isolate be named the Urbani strain of SARS-associated coronavirus.},

abstract = {A new coronavirus has been implicated as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We have used convalescent sera from several SARS patients to detect proteins in the culture supernatants from cells exposed to lavage another SARS patient. The most prominent protein in the supernatant was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) as a approximately 46-kDa species. This was found to be a novel nucleocapsid protein that matched almost exactly one predicted by an open reading frame in the recently published nucleotide sequence of the same virus isolate ({\textgreater}96{\%} coverage). A second viral protein corresponding to the predicted approximately 139-kDa spike glycoprotein has also been examined by MALDI-TOF MS (42{\%} coverage). After peptide N-glycosidase F digestion, 12 glycosylation sites in this protein were confirmed. The sugars attached to four of the sites were also identified. These results suggest that the nucleocapsid protein is a major immunogen that may be useful for early diagnostics, and that the spike glycoprotein may present a particularly attractive target for prophylactic intervention in combating SARS.},

abstract = {The recent identification of a novel clinical entity, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the rapid subsequent spread and case fatality rates of 14-15{\%} have prompted a massive international collaborative investigation facilitated by a network of laboratories established by the World Health Organization (WHO). As SARS has the potential of becoming the first pandemic of the new millennium, a global warning by the WHO was issued on 12 March 2003. The disease, which is believed to have its origin in the Chinese Guangdong province, spread from Hong Kong via international airports to its current worldwide distribution. The concerted efforts of a globally united scientific community have led to the independent isolation and identification of a novel coronavirus from SARS patients by several groups. The extraordinarily rapid isolation of a causative agent of this newly emerged infectious disease constitutes an unprecedented scientific achievement. The main scope of the article is to provide the clinician with an overview of the natural history, epidemiology and clinical characteristics of SARS. On the basis of the recently published viral genome and structural features common to the members of the coronavirus family, a model for host cell-virus interaction and possible targets for antiviral drugs are presented. The epidemiological consequences of introducing a novel pathogen in a previously unexposed population and the origin and evolution of a new and more pathogenic strain of coronavirus are discussed.},

abstract = {Topoisomerase inhibitors are important and clinically effective drugs, while G-quadruplex-interactive compounds that disrupt telomere maintenance mechanisms have yet to be proven useful in the clinic. If G-quadruplex-interactive compounds are to be clinically useful, it will most likely be in combination with more established cytotoxic agents. We have previously reported on a family of topoisomerase II inhibitors that also interact with G-quadruplexes. On the basis of previously established structure-activity relationships (SARs) for compounds that are able to inhibit topoisomerase II or interact with G-quadruplex to varying degrees, we have now designed and synthesized four new fluoroquinoanthroxazines (FQAs) that have different profiles of mixed topoisomerase II poisoning effects and G-quadruplex interactions. The biological profiles of the four new compounds were determined with respect to G-quadruplex interaction (polymerase stop and photocleavage assays) and topoisomerase II interaction (DNA cleavage and kDNA decatenation assays), alongside cytotoxicity tests with matched pairs of topoisomerase II-resistant and topoisomerase II-sensitive cells and with telomerase (+) and ALT (+) cell lines (ALT = alternative lengthening of telomeres). From this study, we have identified two FQAs with sharply contrasting profiles of potent G-quadruplex interaction with a weak topoisomerase II poisoning effect, and vice versa, for further evaluation to determine the optimum combination of these activities in subsequent in vivo studies.},

The syndrome is caused by SARS-associated coronavirus, a novel human infection. SARS-associated coronavirus is spread by multiple mechanisms, including direct contact and large-droplet aerosolization, and may be spread by droplet nuclei as well. Clinical disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, interstitial infiltrates, and variable progression to respiratory failure. No treatment has clearly been shown to be effective. Aggressive infection control measures to prevent viral spread are key to outbreak management.},

abstract = {A new form of atypical pneumonia was reported in the East Asian region beginning from early 2003. This was later termed by the World Health Organisation as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The diagnosis of SARS relies on a combination of clinical features and chest radiographic findings. A preliminary review of SARS in Singapore shows chest radiographic findings of patchy airspace shadowing with severe cases progressing to diffuse air-space shadowing. We illustrate these findings with temporal correlation in our case report. As SARS is a contagious, rapidly progressive and potentially fatal condition, early diagnosis is crucial for prompt management and isolation of patients. Recognition of chest radiographic findings aids in the early diagnosis and containment of SARS.},

@article{Kastberger2003,
abstract = {Temperature is the most frequently measured physical quantity, second only to time. Infrared (IR) technology has been utilized successfully in astronomy (for a summary,see Hermans-Killam, 2002b) and in industrial and research settings (Gruner, 2002; Madding, 1982, 1989; Wolfe {\&} Zissis, 1993) for decades. However, fairly recent innovations have reduced costs, increased reliability, and resulted in noncontact IR sensors offering mobile, smaller units of measurement (EOI, 2002; Flir, 2000, 2001,2002). The advantages of using IR imaging are (1) rapidity in the millisecond range, facilitating measurement of moving targets, (2) noncontact procedures, allowing measurements of hazardous or physically inaccessible objects, (3) no interference and no energy lost from the target, (4) no risk of contamination, and (5) no mechanical effect on the surface of the object. All these factors have led to IR technology's becoming an area of interest for new kinds of applications and users. In both manufacturing and quality control, temperature plays an important role as an indicator of the condition of a product or a piece of machinery (EOI, 2002; Flir, 2000, 2001, 2002; Raytek, 2002). In medical and veterinary applications, IR thermometry is increasingly used in organ diagnostics, in the evaluation of sports injuries and the progression of therapy, in disease evaluation (e.g, breast cancer, arthritis, and SARS; Flir, 2003), and in injury and inflammation examinations in horses, livestock (Tivey {\&} Banhazi, 2002), and zoo animals (Hermans-Killam, 2002a; Thiesbrummel, 2002). Lastly, physiological expressions of life processes in animals (Kastberger, Winder, {\&} Steindl, 2001; Stabentheiner, Kovac, {\&} Hagm{\"{u}}ller, 1995; Stabentheiner, Kovac, {\&} Schmaranzer, 2002; Stabentheiner {\&} Schmarnzer, 1987) and plants (Bermadinger-Stabentheiner {\&} Stabentheiner, 1995) can be monitored. The most recent field in which IR technology has been applied is animal behavior. This article focuses on the practical options for noncontact IR thermometry--in particular, in biological applications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of 34 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing. METHODS: All patients were admitted to the isolation wards. Their demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic characteristics were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: Eight patients came from a family, and 15 patients were medical staff. The mean age of patients was (33.4 +/- 13.4) years. The latent period varied from 2 to 14 days (median 4 days). The most common symptoms were fever (100{\%}), palpitation (91.7{\%}), myalgia (79.2{\%}), headache (70.8{\%}), diarrhea (73.9{\%}) and cough (58.3{\%}). The mean leucocyte count was (4.6 +/- 1.4) x 10(9)/L, and the mean lymphocyte ratio was 0.27 +/- 0.11. 68.4{\%} of the patients had lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count {\textless} 1.3 x 10(9)/L). Other common findings included elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase and erythrocyte sedimentation (76.2{\%}, 28.6{\%} and 47.8{\%}, respectively), and decreased levels of serum iron and albumin (63.2{\%} and 47.8{\%}, respectively). Thirty-two cases had abnormal chest radiographs. In 2 cases in whom typical lung opacities could not be found on the initial plain chest radiographs, thoracic CT proved to be useful. Postmortem examination of 1 patient revealed marked edema with foci of hemorrhage and hyaline membrane formation in the lungs, hemorrhage necrosis and a obvious decline of cells in lymph glands. In a multivariate analysis (Stata 7.0), the independent predictor of an adverse outcome was advanced age (odds ratio per decade of life, 1.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.08 to 2.63; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Fever, lymphopenia, low serum iron and chest radiograph are helpful to diagnose SARS early; age is the independent predictor of an outcome.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify valid measures for preventing outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among protected healthcare workers in isolation units. METHODS: Architectural factors, admitted SARS cases and infection of healthcare workers in different isolation wards between January 30 and March 30, 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS: Four types of isolation wards were analyzed, including the ward where the thirty-first bed was located on the twelfth floor, the laminar flow ward in the Intensive Care Unit where the tenth bed was located on the fifteenth floor, the ward where the twenty-seventh bed was located on the thirteenth floor of the Lingnan Building, and thirty wards on the fourteenth to eighteenth floors of the Zhongshan Building. The ratios (m(2)/m(3)) of the area of the ventilation windows to the volume of the rooms were 0, 0, 1:95 and 1:40, respectively. Numbers of SARS cases in the wards mentioned above were 1, 1, 1 and 96, respectively. Total times of hospitalization were 43, 168, 110 and 1272 hours, respectively. The infection rates of the healthcare workers in the areas mentioned above were 73.2{\%}, 32.1{\%}, 27.5{\%} and 1.7{\%}, respectively. The difference in the infection rates was of statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Isolating SARS cases in wards with good ventilation could reduce the viral load of the ward and might be the key to preventing outbreaks of SARS among healthcare workers along with strict personal protection measures in isolation units.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and therapeutic effect in the early stage of patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). METHODS: A total of 45 clinical diagnosed SARS patients were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: 43 (95.6{\%}) of all 45 patients had exposure to SARS patients and the average incubation time was (7.3 +/- 4.7) days (range 2 to 20 days). The clinical features including fatigue (60{\%}), dry cough (68.9{\%}), dyspnea (53.3{\%}), joint pain (26.7{\%}) and diarrhea (26.7{\%}). The laboratory test show that 33{\%} patients with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, 53.3{\%} with elevated serum aminotransferase and 26.6{\%} with increased creatinine kinase levels. The occurrence of abnormal chest radiographs was (4.2 +/- 2.9) days from the onset, and CT scanning was better than X-ray in the early diagnosis. The average time for the progression and improvement of the chest radiographs were (9.3 +/- 4.1) and (14.5 +/- 5.0) days, respectively. The administration of corticosteroids was started (4.8 +/- 3.5) days from the onset and the maximal dosage using of steroids was (8.4 +/- 3.9) days. There was a significant difference in the dosage of steroid between severe and mild patients [(610.6 +/- 212.4) mg/day vs (268.1 +/- 202.5) mg/day, P {\textless} 0.001)]. The IgG antibody was detected in 22 out of 34 (64.7{\%}) patients and the average time for the occurrence of antibody was (18.2 +/- 6.4) days (range 9-27 days). CONCLUSION: Exposure to the SARS patients happened in most patients. The most common clinical features were fever and fatigue. The most common laboratory abnormalities were leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Serum antibody was not detected until on the 9th day of the course of illness; CT is a more sensitive method for detection of the abnormal chest radiographs than regular X-ray test. The early usage of cortiscosteroids was an efficient method for the treatment, and the dosage of steroids should be individualized.},

abstract = {ECOSAR and DEREKfW predictions for the (eco)toxicological effects of circa 70 substances were compared with experimental data for risk assessment purposes. These and other (quantitative) structure-activity relationships ((Q)SARs) programs will play an important role in future chemical policies, such as in the European Union and The Netherlands, to reduce animal testing and costs and to speed up the number of risk assessments for hazardous chemicals. The two programs, ECOSAR and DEREKfW, were selected because they are easy to use and transparent in their predictions. They predict to which chemical class a substance belongs and also predict some (eco)toxicological properties. ECOSAR categorised 87{\%} of the chemicals correctly in chemical classes. With regard to predicting ecotoxicity, criteria were drawn up for the reliability of the QSARs provided by ECOSAR. Application of these criteria had the result that half of the regression lines from ECOSAR were considered unreliable beforehand. It turned out, however, that the "unreliable" regression lines predicted similar accurately as the "reliable" lines, although much less chemicals were available for validating the "unreliable" QSARs. The overall accurate prediction of toxicity by ECOSAR was 67{\%}. DEREKfW categorised 90{\%} of the chemicals correctly in chemical classes, while 10{\%} of the structural fragments needed a more detailed description. The accuracy of prediction was around 60{\%} for sensitisation, 75{\%} for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity for a limited number of chemicals. Irritation and reproductive toxicity were predicted poorly. Finally, it should be stressed that regulators and industries need to agree on the acceptability criteria relating to false negative and false positive (Q)SAR predictions. This to prevent unnecessary animal testing when regulators do not sufficiently rely on (Q)SAR predictions or to prevent too much faith in (Q)SAR predictions which will then may cause an insufficient protection of man and the environment. Therefore, if the regulatory trend is that (Q)SARs have to be applied more and more systematically in the risk assessment process, their validity and the available tools have to be explored further.},

The M protein is predicted to contain a triple-spanning transmembrane (TM) region, a single N-glycosylation site near its N-terminus that is in the exterior of the virion, and a long C-terminal region in the interior. The M protein harbors a higher substitution rate (0.6{\%} correlated to its size) among viral open reading frames (ORFs) from published data. The four substitutions detected in the M protein, which cause non-synonymous changes, can be classified into three types. One of them results in changes of pI (isoelectric point) and charge, affecting antigenicity. The second changes hydrophobicity of the TM region, and the third one relates to hydrophilicity of the interior structure. Phylogenetic tree building based on the variations of the M protein appears to support the non-human origin of SARS-CoV. To investigate its immunogenicity, we synthesized eight oligopeptides covering 69.2{\%} of the entire ORF and screened them by using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with sera from SARS patients. The results confirmed our predictions on antigenic sites.},

abstract = {A concrete indicator of a government's commitment to mental health services is the amount of financial resources it allocates. To encourage the government to increase mental health funding, it would require additional research and dissemination findings on the economic consequences of mental health disorders, cost-effectiveness benefits of alternatives treatment, and alternative methods of financing for mental health illnesses. In addition, an organized consumer group can be an effective means in informing legislative and government policy makers. Public financing alone is not sufficient for treating mental illness. Private financing may supplement public funding. It would be important to combine both public and private funding to deliver adequate services for mental illness patients. WHO has been very effective in global tobacco control and SARS epidemic. The new administration should use this successful momentum to initiate a global funding campaign for mental health disorder as a top priority.},

abstract = {AIM: Recently, more SARS-CoV virus genome sequences are released to the GenBank database. The aim of this study is to reveal the evolution forces of SARS-CoV virus by analyzing the nucleotide mutations in these sequences. METHODS: We obtained 20 SARS-CoV virus genome sequences from NCBI database, and calculated the ratio of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution per non-synonymous site (Ka) and synonymous nucleotide substitution per synonymous site (Ks) for SARS-CoV virus genes. RESULTS: The Ka/Ks ratios for replicase polyprotein ORF1a, ORF1b, and spike protein gene are 1.09 (P=0.6501), 0.38 (P=0.0074), 0.65 (P=0.0685) respectively. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV virus replicase polyprotein ORF1b is undergoing negative selection; negative selection force is also probably operating on spike protein gene. These results provide basis for future developing a new drug and vaccine against SARS.},

In order to understand the origin and evolution of the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus), we collected complete genome sequences of all viruses available in GenBank, and made comparative analyses with the SARS-CoV. Genomic signature analysis demonstrates that the coronaviruses all take the TGTT as their richest tetranucleotide except the SARS-CoV. A detailed analysis of the forty-two complete SARS-CoV genome sequences revealed the existence of two distinct genotypes, and showed that these isolates could be classified into four groups. Our manual analysis of the BLASTN results demonstrates that the HE (hemagglutinin-esterase) gene exists in the SARS-CoV, and many mutations made it unfamiliar to us.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also SARS) occurred recently in some regions of our country. METHOD: Organ samples of 7 dead cases of SARS were collected from Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic examination. 293 cell line was inoculated with the materials derived from the lungs to isolate causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell cultures were revealed by immunoassay. RESULTS: Both Chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like particles were found in EM. Inclusion bodies containing elementary bodies, reticulate antibodies and intermediate bodies of Chlamydia-like agent were visualized in multiple organs from the 7 dead cases, including lungs (7 cases), spleens (2 cases), livers (2 cases), kidneys (3 cases) and lymph nodes (1 cases), by ultrathin section electron microscopy (EM). In some few sections, coronavirus-like particles were concurrently seen. A coronavirus RNA- polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of two cases of the SARS. After inoculated with materials from the lung samples, the similar Chlamydia-like particles were also found in the inoculated 293 cells. Since the Chlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell cultures could not react with the genus specific antibodies against Chlamydia and monoclonal antibodies against C. pneumoniae and C. psittaci, the results might well be suggestive of a novel Chlamydia-like agent. CONCLUSION: Since the novel Chlamydia-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like agent in the dead cases of SARS, it looks most likely that both the agents play some roles in the disease. At the present time, however, one can hardly determining how did these agents interact each other synergetically, or one follows another, need further study.},

abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious respiratory disease, to the best of our knowledge caused by a hitherto unknown corona virus. The virus has spread from South East Asia to many countries of the world. Three case reports of patients from the Prince of Wales Hospital of The Chinese University of Hong Kong demonstrate typical clinical courses. Fever, cough, in most cases non-productive, myalgia, chills, and rigor are the leading symptoms. Leucopenia and thrombocytopenia are the most prominent laboratory parameters, increased values for lactatedehydrogenase (LDH) reflect a more severe clinical course. Advanced age and coexisting conditions seem to influence the prognosis unfavourably. The chest roentgenogram may be normal initially but at a later stage progressive consolidations in the majority of peripheral parts of the lung are observed, which cannot be differentiated from pneumonias of other origin. Even young patients can enter a stage of respiratory compromise rather fast. A therapy against the cause of the disease is not known. Empirical therapy with ribavirin in combination with high dose corticosteroids have proved successful. The disease may progress into respiratory failure comparable with an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Mortality is around five to ten per cent. Stringent hygiene and quarantine measures are mandatory to prevent the further spread of this threatening disease.},

abstract = {The treatment of atypical pneumonia, subsequently termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), is controversial, and the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy is unknown. We have evaluated the clinical and radiographic outcomes of 72 patients with probable SARS (median age 37 years, 30 M), who received ribavirin and different steroid regimens in two regional hospitals. Chest radiographs were scored according to the percentage of lung field involved. Seventeen patients initially received pulse steroid (PS) (methylprednisolone {\textgreater} or =500 mg/day) and 55 patients initially received nonpulse steroid (NPS) (methylprednisolone {\textless}500 mg/day) therapy. The cumulative steroid dosage; intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates; and hematologic and biochemical parameters were similar in both groups after 21 days. However, patients in the PS group had less oxygen requirement, better radiographic outcome, and less likelihood of requiring rescue PS therapy than their counterparts. There was no significant difference between the two groups in hemolytic anemia, severe secondary infections, or hematemesis, but patients in the PS group had less hyperglycaemia. Initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be a more efficacious and an equally safe steroid regimen when compared with regimens with lower dosage and should be considered as the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the transmission route of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nosocomial infection. METHODS: Ten identified SARS patients were selected from a general hospital in March. Survey was carried out through a standardized questionnaire provided by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Contents of the questionnaire would include: history of contact with SARS patient, route of infection, methods used for protection and so on. RESULTS: (1) Distribution os SARS patients were confined to 3 wards: 4, 5, and 6 on the 7, 8, 12, 13 and 14 floors in the west unit of the inpatient building. Most of the inpatients were elderly and having severe original diseases. (2) Index patients were the first generation source of transmission and they infected inpatients and medical staff, making them the second generation. People with latent infection who had close contact with SARS patients might also serve as the possible source of transmission. (3) The major transmission routes were: near distant droplet infection and close contact infection. There was also a clue to the probability of aerosol or droplet nuclei infection through air-conditioning and ventilation system. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infection appeared to be the main characteristic of the SARS epidemic in the early stage of this hospital. Other than close contact and near space airborne transmission of SARS virus, the possibility of long-distance aerosol transmission called for further epidemiological and experimental studies in the future.},

METHODS: For the first imported SARS case and cases who were transmitted by the index case, epidemiological investigations were conducted using the guidelines for surveillance and case investigation issued by the Ministry of Health. Data as the date of onset of symptoms, date of hospitalization, contact history etc. for each of the cases and their close contacts were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The first imported SARS case introduced to Beijing had infected 9 people within the family and at the hospital, with two of whom died of the same disease. The incubation period for that index case was 4 days, and that for the cases considered to be the secondary and tertiary generations were 7 and 8 days, respectively. The shorter the incubation period, the longer the fever would last and clinically more severe. CONCLUSION: One of the epidemiological characteristics of SARS in Beijing was noticed that the disease clustered in families and hospitals. Infection through droplets and close contact has been viewed as the primary mode of transmission.},

METHODS: Twenty-five patients suffered from SARS with ARDS in the intensive care unit were retrospectively analyzed from December 2002 to April 2003. Statistical analysis was made using SPSS 10.0 and forward stepwise (wald) logistic regression analysis were used to determine the interrelationships between multiple variables and death. P{\textless}0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The following factors were associated with a significantly higher mortality rate in the SARS with ARDS patients, including age increase (OR=1.203, CI=1.036 to 1.396, P=0.016), long-time hypoxia(OR=1.067, CI=1.014 to 1.122, P=0.013), thrombocytopenia(OR=111.932, CI=6.096 to 2 055.252, P=0.001), hypernatremia (OR=26.667, CI=2.242 to 317.147, P=0.009), and elevation of serum creatinine levels (OR=111.932, CI=6.096 to 2 055.252, P=0.001). CONCLUSION: More attention should be paid to deal with these risk factors and to prevent the development of serious complications associated with SARS.},

METHODS: Specimens of the lungs, spleens and lymph nodes were obtained from autopsy of 3 SARS cases to investigate the expression of the immune cells and their activities with double immunohistochemical staining (DAB and AP) by using 14 immune cell markers and their active antigens. RESULTS: A large quantity of proliferated macrophages could be observed in the lungs, spleens and lymph nodes of the SARS patients, some of which were positive for CD25 marker (active macrophages). In the lungs of the 3 patients, localized necrosis occurred where infiltration of CD45RO (+) T lymphocytes was observed, with only scarce Ki67 (+) T lymphocytes (active T lymphocytes) and B lymphocytes. In the lymph nodes, scattered T lymphocytes positive for Ki67 and CD45RO markers (active T lymphocytes) were seen, but the T lymphocytes subpopulations were obviously decreased, which was especially so with CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells. CONCLUSION: Significantly enhanced activity of the macrophages occurs in SARS as the major reactive cells, but T lymphocyte subsets are obviously decreased, indicating the important roles of the macrophages and T lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of SARS.},

METHODS: A total of 1 511 clinically confirmed SARS cases in Guangdong Province of China from November 16, 2002 to Jun 15, 2003 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The first SARS case was identified in Foshan municipality on November 16, 2002, followed by 1 511 clinically confirmed cases (including 58 deaths) up to May 15, 2003. Of all cases, health care workers and community family cluster cases accounted for 19.38{\%} and 12.04{\%}. 65.86{\%} SARS patients aged 20 - 49 years, and increased incidence was positively related to their ages. 95.97{\%} cases lived in the following five cities around Pearl Delta Area: Foshan, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhongshan, and Jiangmen. Eleven early reported cases in the communities took animal-related positions. Face-to-face contacts with infected droplets were the main transmission route. An epidemic peak occurred during January 28 to February 26, and those cases accounted for 50.69{\%} of total. Incidence, mortality, and case fatality of SARS were 1.77/100,000, 0.07/100,000, and 3.84{\%} respectively. The mean incubation period was 4.5 days. CONCLUSION: The most effective way to control SARS is to break the chain of transmission from infected to healthy persons-early identification, prompt and effective isolation, and vigorous close contact tracing. Hospital infections among health care workers is critical. Several observations support the hypothesis of an animal origin for the disease.},

METHODS: Standardized individual case inventory was adopted to conduct investigation on index cases and on persons who had close contact with index cases in Guangdong province. Data on the epidemiological characteristics, secondary cases and the links among index cases were analyzed. RESULTS: Between November 16, 2002 and April 16, 2003, there had been 13 index cases of SARS including 3 cadres, 3 farmers, 2 retirees, 2 workers and 1 shop attendant, reported from 13 cities in Guangdong province. Between November 2002 and January 2003, there had been 7 cities reported to have identified index cases of SARS with 6 of them being infected in their own cities and 1 imported from Guangzhou city. All of the cases had no close contacts to similar patients but 6 of them later caused 2nd or even 3rd generation cases of SARS. Most cases hit young people (7/13) with a sex ratio of 1:0.6. The fatality rate of index cases was high (4/13). CONCLUSION: No evidence showed that there was direct transmission among the index cases. Data regarding the geographical origin of those index cases led to the assumption that the infection had started in six cities of Pearl river delta region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.},

Of the 161 reports, 28 were probably product related, 54 were possibly product related, 71 were unlikely to be related and eight were unclassified. An estimated real incidence of adverse reactions probably and possibly associated with Cartrophen Vet of 0.074 per cent on an individual dose basis was calculated (assuming only 10 per cent were documented due to underreporting). Sixty-two SARs (38.5 per cent) documented emesis, 22 (35.5 per cent) of which were product related (onset five to 15 minutes after administration). Sixty-eight SARs (42.2 per cent) documented general changes to demeanour, 10 (14.7 per cent) were product related (lethargy and/or mild depression and/or mild inappetence lasting up to two days after administration). Six SARs were considered likely to be associated with concurrently administered carprofen. Cartrophen Vet had a low incidence of side effects that were mild and transitory.},

The results showed that in the 69 followed-up patients, impairment of the hepatic function was found in 5 cases, hypoimmune state in 18, impediment of ventilation in the distal air passages with normal major air passages in 15, increased residual volume in 40, mild disturbance of pulmonary diffusion function in 14, incomplete absorption of inflammatory exudates, focal or multiple interstitial lesions, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis and pleural adhesion in 24; increased resistance or mild systolic hypertension in the pulmonary circulation, and segmental ischemia of the left myocardium in 34; and decreased visual acuity in 2. According to TCM differentiation 24 cases belonged to the type of deficiency of both qi and yin, 8 deficiency of both the heart and spleen, 37 depression of the liver and deficiency of the spleen, 18 intermingling with damp-heat, and 7 intermingling with stagnant blood. Some patients still had psychological problems. The study indicates that though clinically cured and discharged from hospital, some SARS patients have functional impairment of the heart, lung and liver, hypoimmune state as well as psychological problems, and need to be treated accordingly for a complete recovery. A rationale for suggested TCM treatment is expounded.},

To summarize the experience and the effects of the system, and to discuss the benefits and problems of the system. METHODS: To set the dependent IP subnet address for the EIRIS. The server was in high available(HA) style. The text information was transmitted by TCP/IP protocol, and the chest X ray film information was transmitted by DICOM protocol. The client workstations were set in the SARS isolation region(at the SARS outpatient department and the SARS x-ray examination room) and the non-SARS isolation region respectively. The incidence of the SARS in medical staffs was recorded before and after the EIRIS was employed. RESULTS: EIRIS made the suspected and the diagnosed SARS cases away from the non-isolation area effectively. The incidence of the disease after the EIRIS running was in a downward trend compared with the incidence before the system run. CONCLUSION: EIRIS was an effective method to break the transmission route of SARS within the hospital. Network and software preparation, the training in computer of the staffs at radiology department, network maintenance and the management system are the keys to the smooth running of the EIRIS.},

METHODS: The groups were classified according to the application of the prevention and protection measure. Group A referred to the stage before the declaration of infectious area was made. Group B was defined as the stage in which the application of common measures of the prevention and protection were made, but the isolation measure was not taken (the suspected or diagnosed cases had the chest X ray film examination in the department of radiology). Group C was the stage after the startup of the isolation measure including the application of EIRIS. the number of the diagnosed cases, the medical staffs exposed, and the diagnosed cases of medical staffs were recorded. RESULTS: In group A, the infectious rate of in-hospital medical staffs showed a marked ascending trend with the regression coefficient of 0.000545, P = 0.04. The rate showed a little descending trend in Group B compared with that in Group A with the regression coefficient of 0.000164, P = 0.140. While marked descending trend compared with group A was demonstrated in group C with the regression coefficient of 0.000037, P = 0.02. CONCLUSION: The trend of the in-hospital medical staffs infection rate changed with different style of prevention and protection measures. With the application of the common measure of the prevention and protection, the rate was significantly lower than that in group A. After the application of the isolation measures including EIRIS, the rate showed the descending trend much further.},

Media articles were sorted and classified by topic, and themes were identified. FINDINGS: Themes were: (a) changing schemas of nursing practice: the new normal; (b) barriers to relational nursing work; (c) work life concerns: retention and recruitment; (d) nursing virtue: nurses as heroes and professionals; (e) paradoxical responses to nurses from the community; and (f) leadership in nursing during the SARS crisis. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis enhanced understanding of how nurses are portrayed in the media, but it indicated the significance of quality of work life and issues about work-home life. Some descriptions of the care and caring of nurses have made nursing seem like an important and influential profession to potential applicants who might previously have dismissed nursing as a career.},

METHODS: 37 SARS patients fulfilled the Guangdong provincial diagnostic criteria for infectious atypical pneumonia and 35 health controls were investigated. The serum levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), troponin I (TnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and myoglobin (MYO) were measured. RESULTS: CK, LDH and AST levels in patients were higher than those of control group (P {\textless} 0.01); furthermore, among patients the levels were higher in fatal cases than in survivors. The positive rates of TnI, CK-MB and MYO in patients were higher than those in controls (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The patients with SARS are subject to complicating myocardiac injury. Therefore, careful monitoring of the myocardiac enzyme profiles is of great importance in reducing the complications and mortality in patients with SARS.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review radiographic findings of patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who were seen at a University of Toronto (Ontario, Canada) teaching hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Findings were reviewed for 40 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for probable SARS. A template was designed for the analysis of each serial radiograph to observe patterns and distribution of disease, interval changes, and complications. The majority of radiographs were anteroposterior views. A clinical database of these patients was also collected for clinical-radiologic comparison. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (18 male, 22 female) was 42.7 years. Patients had a normal chest radiograph and focal, multifocal, and/or bilateral consolidation. The pattern of consolidation tended to be peripheral and poorly marginated and involved middle and lower lung zones. The serial sequence fell into two major subgroups, which correlated closely with clinical outcome. Consolidation in one group cleared within a matter of days, while the second group went on to develop rapid and extensive bilateral pneumonia, with a prolonged hospital stay. Subsegmental atelectasis and pleural complications were rarely observed. CONCLUSION: SARS pneumonia can manifest as focal peripheral consolidation that clears relatively quickly and does not cause secondary complications or that progresses to bilateral consolidation and a more protracted clinical course.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral disease, observed primarily in Southern China in November 2002, with variable flu-like symptoms and pneumonia, in approx. 5{\%} leading to death from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). The disease was spread over more than 30 states all over the globe by SARS-virus-infected travelers. WHO and CDC received first information about a new syndrome by the end of February 2003, after the first cases outside the Republic of China had been observed. A case in Hanoi, Vietnam, led to the first precise information about the new disease entity to WHO, by Dr. Carlo Urbani, a co-worker of WHO/Doctors without Borders, who had been called by local colleagues to assist in the management of a patient with an unknown severe disease by the end of February 2003. Dr. Urbani died from SARS, as did many other health care workers. In the meantime, more than 7,000 cases have been observed worldwide, predominantly in China and Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, and the USA, and many other countries, and more than 600 of these patients died from RDS. Since the beginning of March 2003, when WHO and CDC started their activities, in close collaboration with a group of international experts, including the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute in Hamburg and the Department of Virology in Frankfurt/Main, a previously impossible success in the disclosure of the disease was achieved. Within only 8 weeks of research it was possible to describe the infectious agent, a genetically modified coronavirus, including the genetic sequence, to establish specific diagnostic PCR methods and to find possible mechanisms for promising therapeutic approaches. In addition, intensifying classical quarantine and hospital hygiene measures, it was possible to limit SARS in many countries to sporadic cases, and to reduce the disease in countries such as Canada and Vietnam. This review article summarizes important information about many issues of SARS (May 15th, 2003). Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher. ger},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a recently identified Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The clinical symptoms are non-specific and during the first few days in particular, are not clinically distinguishable from those of many other viral or bacterial infections. The majority of infected patients develop pneumonia within a week of the first symptoms appearing. Since November 2002 the virus has spread from South China to almost 30 other countries, where about 8500 infected individuals have been registered; about 800 people have already died from the disease (9.5{\%}). The number of infected persons includes a noticeably high percentage of health workers. This fact underlines the importance of good infection prevention measures for each patient contact. The implementation of hygienic measures requires attention, because the infection of personnel in Toronto hospitals still occurred after the virus and transmission routes were known. It appears that transmission can be prevented with relatively simple precautions, as long as these are consistently implemented. Early recognition and isolation of a possible source are an essential part of this. SARS is a group A notifiable disease (report if suspected). In the Netherlands the general practitioner has a prominent role in assessing and treating individuals who are infected or might be infected with SARS-CoV. A protocol and a detailed action plan are available. In addition to this hospitals should be prepared for the initial reception of a patient with SARS, who presents directly to the outpatients' clinic or Casualty Department.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize and analyze the clinical manifestation, diagnosis and therapeutic strategy of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and its characteristics of outbreak in hospital via infection transmission cluster associated with SARS patients. METHODS: (1) Two hospitalized community acquired SARS cases with their clinical data and epidemiologically linked transmission clusters in our hospital were analyzed; (2) The clinical data from 41 SARS cases were summarized. RESULTS: (1) The contagiousness of SARS virus in SARS patients was extremely strong, especially in their acute stage. (2) The majority of clinical manifestations were fever (100{\%} cases), and there were no obvious respiratory symptoms in more than half of the patients (53.7{\%}) at early SARS stage (day 1 to day 3), accompanied by leucopenia(52.6{\%}) and lymphopenia (68.4{\%}). (3) Timely administration of Ribavirin, Methylprednisolone, immunoenhancer (such as interferon alpha-2b, thymosin-alpha1) to SARS patients was efficacious to certain extent in controlling the development of the disease. CONCLUSION: It is very important for clinicians to pay great attention to protect themselves from infection of SARS. Early discovery of SARS, early isolation of SARS patients, and early treatment are very helpful to improving patient's prognosis and controlling SARS overspread.},

The relation of the human SARS-CoV to other coronaviruses, i.e. the rooting of the tree is suggested by choosing an appropriate outgroup. SARS-CoV makes a separate group closer but still distant from G2 (CoVs in mammalian host). The relation between different isolates of the human SARS virus is inferred by first constructing an ultrametric distance matrix from counting sequence variations in the genomes. The resulting tree is consistent with clinic relations between the SARS-CoV isolates. In addition to a larger variety of coronavirus genomes these results provide phylogenetic knowledge based on independent novel methodology as compared to recent phylogenetic studies on SARS-CoV.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious condition caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a new member in the family Coronaviridae. To evaluate the lung pathology in this life-threatening respiratory illness, we studied postmortem lung sections from 8 patients who died from SARS during the spring 2003 Singapore outbreak. The predominant pattern of lung injury in all 8 cases was diffuse alveolar damage. The histology varied according to the duration of illness. Cases of 10 or fewer days' duration demonstrated acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of more than 10 days' duration exhibited organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated giant cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. In acute-phase DAD, pancytokeratin staining was positive in hyaline membranes along alveolar walls and highlighted the absence of pneumocytes. Multinucleated cells were shown to be both type II pneumocytes and macrophages by pancytokeratin, thyroid transcription factor-1, and CD68 staining. SARS-CoV RNA was identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in 7 of 8 cases in fresh autopsy tissue and in 8 of 8 cases in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue, including the 1 negative case in fresh tissue. Understanding the pathology of DAD in SARS patients may provide the basis for therapeutic strategies. Further studies of the pathogenesis of SARS may reveal new insight into the mechanisms of DAD.},

abstract = {In early February 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) began receiving reports of patients with a syndrome characterized by an atypical pneumonia with rapid progression to respiratory failure without an identified cause despite extensive diagnostic workups. Most of these reports pointed out that the outbreak started in Southern China, specifically in the Guandong Province. The initial outbreak in South East Asia has already spread to other Regions in Asia, Europe, North and South America, and South Africa. Many of these cases can be linked through chains of transmission to an index case from the Guandong Province who visited Hong Kong. Although the exact mode of transmission has not been clearly established, the etiology of this syndrome has already been identified. A novel Coronavirus has been identified by electron microscopy and molecular assays in multiple laboratories from respiratory specimens throughout the world. The syndrome has been defined as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) by WHO, and is characterized by an incubation period between 1 and 10 days (average 5 days) and by a febrile phase that usually lasts approximately 3 days. During the respiratory phase that begins around day 3, patients start developing a dry cough, shortness of breath and hypoxemia. Mechanical ventilatory support is required in about 10 to 40{\%} of cases and the case-fatality rate ranges between 3 and 16{\%}. The laboratory findings in SARS cases include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and a rise in transaminases and lactic dehydrogenase levels. Treatment of SARS includes supportive measures and the empiric use of ribavirin. Respiratory isolation, use of respiratory masks, and compulsory hand hygiene constitute the principal preventive measures. The confirmation of a case can be performed at reference laboratories by serologic and molecular assays. From the onset of this epidemic Mexico established a surveillance system as well as clinical guidelines and recommendations for the identification, prevention of secondary spread, and medical management of suspicious and probable cases by health care personnel.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized infectious disease capable of causing severe respiratory failure. OBJECTIVE: To determine the epidemiological features, course, and outcomes of patients with SARS-related critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective case series of 38 adult patients with SARS-related critical illness admitted to 13 intensive care units (ICUs) in the Toronto area between the onset of the outbreak and April 15, 2003. Data were collected daily during the first 7 days in the ICUs, and patients were followed up for 28 days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was mortality at 28 days after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included rate of SARS-related critical illness, number of tertiary care ICUs and staff placed under quarantine, and number of health care workers (HCWs) contracting SARS secondary to ICU-acquired transmission. RESULTS: Of 196 patients with SARS, 38 (19{\%}) became critically ill, 7 (18{\%}) of whom were HCWs. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of the 38 patients was 57.4 (39.0-69.6) years. The median (IQR) duration between initial symptoms and admission to the ICU was 8 (5-10) days. Twenty-nine (76{\%}) required mechanical ventilation and 10 of these (34{\%}) experienced barotrauma. Mortality at 28 days was 13 (34{\%}) of 38 patients and for those requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was 13 (45{\%}) of 29. Six patients (16{\%}) remained mechanically ventilated at 28 days. Two of these patients had died by 8 weeks' follow-up. Patients who died were more often older, had preexisting diabetes mellitus, and on admission to hospital were more likely to have bilateral radiographic infiltrates. Transmission of SARS in 6 study ICUs led to closure of 73 medical-surgical ICU beds. In 2 university ICUs, 164 HCWs were quarantined and 16 (10{\%}) developed SARS. CONCLUSIONS: Critical illness was common among patients with SARS. Affected patients had primarily single-organ respiratory failure, and half of mechanically ventilated patients died. The SARS outbreak greatly strained regional critical care resources.},

Here we provide proof from experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that the newly discovered SARS-associated coronavirus (SCV) is the aetiological agent of this disease. Our understanding of the aetiology of SARS will expedite the development of diagnostic tests, antiviral therapies and vaccines, and may allow a more concise case definition for this emerging disease.

The purpose of this mission was to reinforce the local medical staff, to bring medical equipment, and to assist in identifying the cause of the SARS epidemic. Most of the 39 cases observed involved health care personnel working at the hospital. Six including 5 who died presented severe manifestations. Application of strict empirical measures of isolation, hygiene, and personal protection allowed containment of the SARS outbreak in Hanoi.},

Within this series, several compounds have excellent in vitro potency and our computational models accurately justify the structure-activity relationships (SARs) and highlight essential hydrogen bonding residues and hydrophobic pockets within the catalytic domain of PARP-1. Administration of these compounds (5q, 17a and 17e) in the mouse model of streptozotocin-induced diabetes results in maintainance of glucose levels. Furthermore, one such inhibitor (5g, IC(50)=26 nM) demonstrated significant reduction of infarct volume in the rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the temporal profile of serum antibody against coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and to evaluate the reliability of indirect immuno-fluorescence assay (IFA) in the diagnosis of SARS. METHODS: Clinically confirmed SARS patients, suspected SARS patients, and controls were included in the study. IFA was used to detect the serum antibody against SARS coronavirus. General information about the subjects was collected using a standard questionnaire. RESULTS: The positive rates of specific IgG and IgM against SARS virus within 10 days after onset of the disease were 55.1{\%} and 16.3{\%} respectively and then increased up to 89.8{\%} for IgG and 65.3{\%} for IgM. After 25 days of the onset of the disease, 90.9{\%} patients became positive for both IgG and IgM. Results from chi-square for trend test revealed that the positive rates of both IgG and IgM increased with time (chi(2) for trend = 16.376, P = 0.00005 for IgG; chi(2) for trend = 28.736, P = 0.00000 for IgM). Sensitivity, specificity and agreement value of IFA regarding the diagnosis of SARS were all higher than 90{\%}. CONCLUSION: IFA can be used to assist diagnosis of SARS after 10 days of the onset of disease.},

Population health technology is the umbrella term for technology applications that have a population focus and the potential to improve public health. This includes the Internet, but also other technologies such as wireless devices, mobile phones, smart appliances, or smart homes. In the context of an outbreak or bioterrorism attack, such technologies may help to gather intelligence and detect diseases early, and communicate and exchange information electronically worldwide. Some of the technologies brought forward during the SARS epidemic may have been primarily motivated by marketing efforts, or were more directed towards reassuring people that "something is being done," ie, fighting an "epidemic of fear." To understand "fear epidemiology" is important because early warning systems monitoring data from a large number of people may not be able to discriminate between a biological epidemic and an epidemic of fear. The need for critical evaluation of all of these technologies is stressed.},

abstract = {This article is a review of the effects of radiofrequency (RF) energy on (1). survival and (2). cancer in the same animal populations having survival data. The literature consisted of 18 studies with survival data, and 16 of these have information on cancer. In one study, a significant decrease in lifespan was observed at 6.8 W/kg but not at 2 W/kg. Thermal stress appears to be the causal factor for the effect on lifespan because the higher dose rate, unlike the lower dose rate, was estimated to increase body temperature significantly. The finding that the lower level was without effect is consistent with the results of a number of recent studies showing that long term, low level exposure to RF energy did not affect survival adversely. Many of these recent studies addressed the cancer issue by histopathological analysis of many organs and tissues following exposure up to 2 years, the average lifetime of rats and mice. Some investigations examined the effect of RF fields from mobile phones on brain cancer, including the progression of chemically induced brain cancer. The results demonstrate that RF exposure did not adversely affect cancer incidence at whole body specific absorption rates (SARs) {\textless}or=4 W/kg and brain SARs {\textless}or=2.3 W/kg. The weight-of-evidence of these 18 studies shows that long term, low level exposure to RF energy does not adversely affect survival and cancer in laboratory mammals.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) energy has been reported to cause a variety of ocular effects, primarily cataracts but also effects on the retina, cornea, and other ocular systems. Cataracts have been observed in experimental animals when one eye was exposed to a localized, very high RF field and the other eye was the unexposed control. The results show that 2450 MHz exposures for {\textgreater}or=30 min at power densities causing extremely high dose rates ({\textgreater}or=150 W/kg) and temperatures ({\textgreater}or=41 degrees C) in or near the lens caused cataracts in the rabbit eye. However, cataracts were not observed in the monkey eye exposed to similar exposure conditions, reflecting the different patterns of energy absorption (SAR, specific absorption rate) distribution, due to their different facial structure. Since the monkey head is similar in structure to the human head, the nonhuman primate study showed that the incident power density levels causing cataracts in rabbits and other laboratory animals cannot be directly extrapolated to primates, including human beings. It is reasonable to assume that an SAR that would induce temperatures {\textgreater}or=41 degrees C in or near the lens in the human eye would produce cataracts by the same mechanism (heating) that caused cataracts in the rabbit lens; however, such an exposure would greatly exceed the currently allowable limits for human exposure and would be expected to cause unacceptable effects in other parts of the eye and face. Other ocular effects including corneal lesions, retinal effects, and changes in vascular permeability, have been observed after localized exposure of the eye of laboratory animals to both continuous wave (CW) and pulsed wave (PW) exposures, but the inconsistencies in these results, the failure to independently confirm corneal lesions after CW exposure, the failure to independently confirm retinal effects after PW exposure, and the absence of functional changes in vision are reasons why these ocular effects are not useful in defining an adverse effect level for RF exposure. While cataracts develop after localized exposure of the eye at SARs {\textgreater}or= 150 W/kg, whole body exposure at much lower levels (14-42 W/kg) is lethal to rabbits. Two studies reported cataracts in this animal after 30 daily exposures at SARs at the upper end of the lethal range, e.g., 38-42 W/kg; however, long term exposure of rabbits (23 h/day, 6 months) at 1.5 W/kg (17 W/kg in the rabbit head) did not cause cataracts or other ocular effects. A long term (1-4 years) investigation of monkeys exposed at high SARs (20 and 40 W/kg to the monkey face) found no cataracts or other ocular effects or change in visual capability. The results of these long term studies support the conclusion that clinically significant ocular effects, including cataracts, have not been confirmed in human populations exposed for long periods of time to low level RF energy. The results of four recent human studies show that there is no clear evidence of an association between RF exposure and ocular cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is continuing to spread around the world. All hospitals must be prepared to care for patients with SARS. Thus, it is important to understand the transmission of this disease in hospitals and to evaluate methods for its containment in health care institutions. We describe how we cared for the first 2 patients with SARS admitted to our 419-bed community hospital in Richmond Hill, Ont., and the response to a SARS outbreak within our institution. METHODS: We collected clinical and epidemiological data about patients and health care workers at our institution who during a 13-day period had a potential unprotected exposure to 2 patients whose signs and symptoms were subsequently identified as meeting the case definition for probable SARS. The index case at our hospital was a patient who was transferred to our intensive care unit (ICU) from a referral hospital on Mar. 16, 2003, where he had been in close proximity to the son of the individual with the first reported case of SARS in Toronto. After 13 days in the ICU, a diagnosis of probable SARS was reached for our index case. Immediately upon diagnosis of our index case, respiratory isolation and barrier precautions were instituted throughout our hospital and maintained for a period of 10 days, which is the estimated maximum incubation period reported for this disease. Aggressive surveillance measures among hospital staff, patients and visitors were also maintained during this time. RESULTS: During the surveillance period, 15 individuals (10 hospital staff, 3 patients and 2 visitors) were identified as meeting the case definition for probable or suspected SARS, in addition to our index case. All but 1 individual had had direct contact with a symptomatic patient with SARS during the period of unprotected exposure. No additional cases were identified after infection control precautions had been implemented for 8 days. No cases of secondary transmission were identified in the 21 days following the implementation of these precautions at our institution. INTERPRETATION: SARS can easily be spread by direct personal contact in the hospital setting. We found that the implementation of aggressive infection control measures is effective in preventing further transmission of this disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To summarize the clinical features of liver injury in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), providing information for further mechanism and clinical study. METHODS: The clinical and some laboratory data of 154 patients suffered from SARS were collected and analyzed, who were admitted to the isolation wards of Beijing You-an Hospital from March 11 to June 3, 2003. The serum samples were taken from 46 patients to detect IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, endotoxin and hepatitis related viral inclusions. In addition, 11 patients were detected ultrasonically, and 3 patients were described pathological features. Other two groups including 15 healthy care workers and 22 patients with chronic hepatitis in the same period were selected and analyzed as controls. RESULTS: When being admitted to hospital, serum ALT and (or) AST levels were elevated in 37.7{\%} SARS patients. Some of them (43.1{\%}) were mild, and most of them (56.9{\%}) were moderate. Abnormal liver function mainly resulted from ALT elevation (70.7{\%}), then both ALT and AST elevation (22.4{\%}). The aminotransferases in 75.9{\%} SARS patients normalized within two weeks, while they elevated in four patients during the hospitalization. There was a significant difference in ALT/AST elevation rates between severe and mild clinical type (chi2=19.28, P{\textless}0.05). Serum total bilirubin values elevated in 8.4{\%} patients. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels decreased in 24.0{\%} and 28.6{\%} patients, respectively. Creatine kinase (CK) and (or) creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels elevated in 72.7{\%} patients when they hospitalized. The six kinds of interleukins and TNF-alpha levels during the first week of hospitalization were higher than those in the fourth week and in control groups (t{\textgreater}or=1.67, P{\textless}0.05). The levels of some factors, such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 in patients with elevated ALT, were higher than those in ALT normal patients (t{\textgreater}or=2.36, P{\textless}0.05). In the first week, only 15.2{\%} patients had elevated serum endotoxin level. Ultrasonic examination and pathological observation showed no special features, compared with those in common acute hepatitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: All the results suggest strongly that there may be a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in most SARS patients in early stage, and the liver damage is only its partial signs. It may be beneficial to suppress cytokines storm in SARS patients in early stage, which will stop the progression of SIRS and release hepatic damage and improve the prognosis of SARS patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The causal agent for SARS is considered as a novel coronavirus that has never been described both in human and animals previously. The stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments was studied. METHODS: Using a SARS coronavirus strain CoV-P9, which was isolated from pharyngeal swab of a probable SARS case in Beijing, its stability in mimic human specimens and in mimic environment including surfaces of commonly used materials or in household conditions, as well as its resistance to temperature and UV irradiation were analyzed. A total of 10(6) TCID50 viruses were placed in each tested condition, and changes of the viral infectivity in samples after treatments were measured by evaluating cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell line Vero-E6 at 48 h after infection. RESULTS: The results showed that SARS coronavirus in the testing condition could survive in serum, 1:20 diluted sputum and feces for at least 96 h, whereas it could remain alive in urine for at least 72 h with a low level of infectivity. The survival abilities on the surfaces of eight different materials and in water were quite comparable, revealing reduction of infectivity after 72 to 96 h exposure. Viruses stayed stable at 4 degrees C, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability in cells, but were converted to be non-infectious after 90-, 60- and 30-min exposure at 56 degrees C, at 67 degrees C and at 75 degrees C, respectively. Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level. CONCLUSION: The survival ability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments seems to be relatively strong. Heating and UV irradiation can efficiently eliminate the viral infectivity.},

However, clinical and experimental evidence implicates the possibility of co-infection. In this report, reovirus was isolated from throat swabs of SARS patients, including the first case in Beijing and her mother. Identification with the electron microscopy revealed the characteristic features of reovirus. 24 of 38 samples from other SARS cases were found to have serologic responses to the reovirus. Primers designed for reovirus have amplified several fragments of DNA, one of which was sequenced (S2 gene fragment), which indicates it as a unique reovirus (orthoreovirus). Preliminary animal experiment showed that inoculation of the reovirus in mice caused death with atypical pneumonia. Nevertheless, the association of reovirus with SARS outbreak requires to be further investigated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently been identified as a new clinical entity. SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown infectious agent. METHODS: Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques. RESULTS: A novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was isolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was obtained by a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR)-based random-amplification procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence, conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the late convalescent phase. Infected patients showed seroconversion on the Vero cells in which the virus was isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus might have a role in causing SARS.},

@article{Donnelly2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Health authorities worldwide, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are seeking effective public-health interventions in the continuing epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We assessed the epidemiology of SARS in Hong Kong. METHODS: We included 1425 cases reported up to April 28, 2003. An integrated database was constructed from several sources containing information on epidemiological, demographic, and clinical variables. We estimated the key epidemiological distributions: infection to onset, onset to admission, admission to death, and admission to discharge. We measured associations between the estimated case fatality rate and patients' age and the time from onset to admission. FINDINGS: After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6.4 days (95{\%} CI 5.2-7.7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13.2{\%} (9.8-16.8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43.3{\%} (35.2-52.4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric gamma distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6.8{\%} (4.0-9.6) and 55.0{\%} (45.3-64.7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Patients' age was strongly associated with outcome. The time between onset of symptoms and admission to hospital did not alter outcome, but shorter intervals will be important to the wider population by restricting the infectious period before patients are placed in quarantine.},

Routine HE stain was used to study all the cases. Part of the lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello's stain, viral inclusion body stain, reticulin and PAS stains, immunohistochemistry, thin sections with staining, light microscopy and transmission electronic microscope investigation. RESULTS: The earliest symptom of all 3 cases was hyperpyrexia and followed by progressive dyspnea and appearance of lung field shadows in X rays findings. Pulmonary lesions included: bilateral and extensive consolidation, localized hemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative alveolitis and bronchitis, alveolar proliferation and desquamation, accumulation of protein exudates, mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells as well as hyaline membrane formation in alveoli and viral inclusion bodies were seen in the alveolus epithelial cells. The exudated organization tended to become glomeruloid organizing pneumonitis in a few avaoli. Lesions of the immune organs included: large patchy necrosis in the spleens and localized necrosis in the lymph nodes were seen. Bone marrow became restrained. There were lesions of systemic small vasculitis including edema of the perivascular tissue and vascular wall of the small veins with localized fibrinoid necrosis distributing in the heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands and the striated muscles accompanying with mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltration. Thrombosis was seen in part of the small veins. In addition, there were also the systemic poisonous changes including: degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in lungs, liver, kidneys, heart and adrenals. Electronic microscopy demonstrated clusters of virus particles seen in the lung tissue. CONCLUSION: SARS is a systemic disease. Lungs, immune system and systemic small vessels are the main target organs attacked by the virus. Extensive consolidation of lungs, formation of hyaline membrane to a large extent, respiratory distress and decrease of immune function are the main causes of death.},

The lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello staining, viral inclusion body staining, reticulin staining, PAS staining, immunohistochemistry, ultrathin sectioning and staining, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The first symptom was hyperpyrexia in all three cases, followed by progressive dyspnoea and lung field shadowing. The pulmonary lesions included bilateral extensive consolidation, localized haemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative pulmonary alveolitis and bronchitis, proliferation and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells, exudation of protein and monocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells in alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, and viral inclusion bodies in alveolar epithelial cells. There was also massive necrosis of splenic lymphoid tissue and localized necrosis in lymph nodes. Systemic vasculitis included oedema, localized fibrinoid necrosis, and infiltration of monocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells into vessel walls in the heart, lung, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, and the stroma of striated muscles. Thrombosis was present in small veins. Systemic toxic changes included degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in the lung, liver, kidney, heart, and adrenal gland. Electron microscopy demonstrated clusters of viral particles, consistent with coronavirus, in lung tissue. SARS is a systemic disease that injures many organs. The lungs, immune organs, and systemic small vessels are the main targets of virus attack, so that extensive consolidation of the lung, diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membrane formation, respiratory distress, and decreased immune function are the main causes of death.},

abstract = {We have compared localized (LAR) and systemic (SAR) acquired resistance induced in tobacco by a hypersensitive response (HR) inducing Phytophthora megasperma glycoprotein elicitin. Three different zones were taken into account: LAR, SAR(T) and SAR(S). The LAR zone was 5-10 mm wide and surrounded the HR lesion. SAR(T) was the tissue of the elicitor-treated leaf immediately beyond the LAR zone. The systemic leaf was called SAR(S). Glycoprotein-treated plants showed enhanced resistance to challenge infection by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Disease resistance was similar in SAR(T) and SAR(S), and higher in LAR. The expression pattern, in glycoprotein-treated plants, of acidic and basic PR1, PR2, PR3 and PR5 proteins and of O-methyltransferases (OMT), enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway, was similar to that in TMV-infected plants. OMT was stimulated in LAR but not in SAR(T) and SAR(S). The four classes of acidic and basic PR proteins accumulated strongly in LAR. Reduced amounts of acidic PR1, PR2, PR3 and only minute amounts of basic PR2 and PR3 accumulated in SAR(T) and SAR(S). In glycoprotein-treated plants, expression of the acidic and basic PR proteins in LAR and SAR of transgenic NahG and ETR tobacco plants and in LAR of plants treated with inhibitors of salicylic acid accumulation and of ethylene biosynthesis indicated a salicylic acid-dependent signalling pathway for acidic isoform activation and an ethylene-dependent signalling pathway for basic isoform activation.},

In the United States, under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) use SARs to estimate the hazards of existing and new chemicals. Within the Existing Substances Regulation in Europe, QSARs may be used for data evaluation, test strategy indications, and the identification and filling of data gaps. To illustrate where and when QSARs may be useful and when their use is more problematic, an example, methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), is given and the predicted and experimental data are compared. Improvements needed for new QSARs and tools for developing and using QSARs are discussed.},

We assessed the antiviral potential of ribavirin, 6-azauridine, pyrazofurin, mycophenolic acid, and glycyrrhizin against two clinical isolates of coronavirus (FFM-1 and FFM-2) from patients with SARS admitted to the clinical centre of Frankfurt University, Germany. Of all the compounds, glycyrrhizin was the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS-associated virus. Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.},

abstract = {In this article we use global and regional data from the SARS epidemic in conjunction with a model of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, and recovered classes of people ("SEIJR") to extract average properties and rate constants for those populations. The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a significant slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza (J. Math. Biol. 27 (1989) 233). Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than 10{\%} in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS. The possibility that 10 or more percent of the world population at risk could eventually be infected with the virus in conjunction with a mortality rate of 3-7{\%} or more, and indications of significant improvement in Toronto support the stringent measures that have been taken to isolate diagnosed cases.},

Although very few true cases of SARS were detected in the United Kingdom, the public health response to the threat of SARS was considerable. The main components of this response were the early detection, isolation and reporting of cases, and the provision of comprehensive information to health professionals, cases, their contacts and the public. The development of the response to SARS raised a number of more general issues relevant to future infectious epidemic threats. Although the World Health Organisation has now declared SARS 'contained', the possibility of re-emergence is ever present. All countries will need to be vigilant and plan their response to the possibility of a renewed SARS epidemic.},

It has been observed that both the above compounds interact with the active site of the SARS enzyme through six hydrogen bonds. Also, a clear definition of the binding pocket for KZ7088 has been presented. These findings may provide a solid basis for subsite analysis and mutagenesis relative to rational design of highly selective inhibitors for therapeutic application. Meanwhile, the idea of how to develop inhibitors of the SARS enzyme based on the knowledge of its own peptide substrates (the so-called "distorted key" approach) was also briefly elucidated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We studied the prevalence of akathisia and its relationship to a number of sociodemographic and clinical factors in a population of Chinese inpatients with Schizophrenia. METHOD: Six-hundred and forty-five patients were recruited for the study. Akathisia was assessed using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), dyskinesia by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) and extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE) were assessed by the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale (SARS). RESULTS: Only 35 (5{\%}) patients were assessed to have akathisia. There was no gender or ethnic difference in the rates of akathisia. However, the majority of the patients (65{\%}) were receiving an anticholinergic agent at the time of the study. CONCLUSION: Our findings of an overlap between TD and EPSE support the suggestion that there may be a common vulnerability for these movement disorders. The finding of a low rate of akathisia among our Asian patients suggests an inter-ethnic difference in the vulnerability for the development of akathisia. However, comparing our results with the rates reported from other countries may be hampered by the diagnostic and methodological differences across studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of children with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and to examine the difference between the younger and older age groups. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive cohort study. SETTING: A regional hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Children younger than 18 yrs with SARS. RESULTS: Twenty-one children were included, with a mean age of 10.7 +/- 5.1 yrs. Children with SARS presented with fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, chills, headache, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Examination of the chest showed minimal auscultatory findings. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mild elevations of activated partial thromboplastin time, alanine transaminase, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase. Bacteriologic and virologic studies were all negative for common pathogens. Unilateral focal opacity was the commonest finding in chest radiography. High-resolution computerized tomography of the thorax was an early diagnostic tool if the chest radiograph was negative. The clinical course was less severe in comparison with adult patients. However, adolescents (age, {\textgreater} or =12 yrs) resembled adults in their clinical features. When compared with the younger age group, the adolescents had significantly higher temperatures, more constitutional upset, and a greater need for steroid treatment. Children younger than 12 yrs seemed less ill but had more coughing. On the whole, the outcome was favorable. CONCLUSION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome affects children, but the course is less severe. Nevertheless, the disease could have a significant psychosocial impact on children because of the potential seriousness of the disease in their adult family members.},

Medical reports suggest that a direct contact with the secretion or respiratory droplets from a patient through a short distance is very likely to be the possible way of transmitting the disease. World Health Organization (WHO), hence, has advised international travellers to avoid visiting several regions that have the most number of SARS cases, including Hong Kong. Since then, the number of hotel guests has largely dropped to a level that Hong Kong has never experienced before. As a totally new experience to the hotel industry in Hong Kong and elsewhere, hoteliers basically do not have enough knowledge to respond to epidemic crisis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taipei has been associated with Taiwanese back from Guangdong, China. We report 4 probable SARS cases with different severity and propose optimal treatment. METHODS: Four probable SARS cases were enrolled. Two cases were due to outbreak of SARS in our hospital and two cases were transferred from other hospitals. All patients received standard treatment: ribavirin 1000 mg orally daily for 10 days, Levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 7 days, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 g/kg/day for 2 day after the onset of symptoms. If severe hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2 {\textless} 200) occurred, protective strategy of mechanical ventilation and methylprednisolone 2 mg/kg/day were given. The clinical pictures and treatment outcome were discussed. RESULTS: Fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, malaise, dizziness and dry cough were initially more common symptoms. Initially chest patterns included focal consolidation, interstitial infiltration or normal. Common laboratory findings were lymphopenia, and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. No mortality was found. CONCLUSIONS: Highly alert and stringent infection control of SARS cases are required. Otherwise, SARS easily induces hospital-acquired first then community-acquired infection. Initial presentation of radiographic patterns includes normal, interstitial or airspace shadowing. Fever and lymphopenia are occasionally followed by rapidly progressive respiratory compromise. The standard treatment might be beneficial for decreasing the mortality rate.},

METHODS: A university with more than thirty thousand undergraduates, staff and their relatives was retrospectively studied, from which information regarding the status of epidemic, organization of leadership, disease control strategies and measures were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The construction of the surveillance system in such a model as "individual-dormitory/home-class/unite-faculty and institute-university" largely contributed to the achievement of the goals of low incidence, no secondary, no epidemic, and no death. A series of control measures benefited the early diagnosis, effective isolation, prevention, and treatment of SARS control. CONCLUSION: SARS could be effectively controlled in university only if strict surveillance system is built up, and all-round preventions, including early isolation of both confirmed or suspected cases and close contacted persons, are carried out.},

abstract = {A new system to recognize protein coding genes in the coronavirus genomes, specially suitable for the SARS-CoV genomes, has been proposed in this paper. Compared with some existing systems, the new program package has the merits of simplicity, high accuracy, reliability, and quickness. The system ZCURVE{\_}CoV has been run for each of the 11 newly sequenced SARS-CoV genomes. Consequently, six genomes not annotated previously have been annotated, and some problems of previous annotations in the remaining five genomes have been pointed out and discussed. In addition to the polyprotein chain ORFs 1a and 1b and the four genes coding for the major structural proteins, spike (S), small envelop (E), membrane (M), and nuleocaspid (N), respectively, ZCURVE{\_}CoV also predicts 5-6 putative proteins in length between 39 and 274 amino acids with unknown functions. Some single nucleotide mutations within these putative coding sequences have been detected and their biological implications are discussed. A web service is provided, by which a user can obtain the annotated result immediately by pasting the SARS-CoV genome sequences into the input window on the web site (http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/sars/). The software ZCURVE{\_}CoV can also be downloaded freely from the web address mentioned above and run in computers under the platforms of Windows or Linux.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the morphological features of the lungs obtained from autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHODS: Bilateral lungs from 7 patients died from SARS were carefully studied grossly and microscopically. All tissues from these cases were routinely processed and carefully studied. RESULTS: All lungs from these cases were extremely expanded and became solid. Microscopically, the edema and fibrin exudates in the alveoli was the most common findings, especially in the early phase of the disease. The hyaline membrane was almost always present in the lungs of these cases. The organization of intra-alveolar fibrin exudates along with the interstitial fibrosis led to obliteration of alveoli and consolidation of lungs. The desquamation and hyperplasia of alveolar lining cells was also apparent. Foci of haemorrhage and lobular pneumonia, even diffuse fungal infection were frequently seen in these specimens. Micro-thrombus were easily found in these lungs. CONCLUSIONS: The lung of SARS from autopsy is characterized by edema, intra-alveolar fibrin exudates, hyaline membrane formation, organization of intra-alveolar exudates and fibrosis, which lead to the obliteration of alveoli and consolidation of lungs.},

abstract = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be associated with various disorders. Among these, coronavirus infection may cause life-threatening severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this review, we present animal models and techniques for the study of ARDS, and discuss the roles and possible mechanisms of various chemical factors, including nitric oxide (NO). Our early work revealed that cerebral compression elicits severe hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (PE), leading to central sympathetic activation that results in systemic vasoconstriction. The consequence of systemic vasoconstriction is volume and pressure loading in the pulmonary circulation. Vasodilators, but not oxidant radical scavengers, are effective in the prevention of centrogenic PE. In isolated perfused lung, exogenous and endogenous NO enhances lung injury following air embolism and ischemia/reperfusion. In contrast, NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors reverse such lung injury. Although NO is important in maintaining vasodilator tone, hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction is accompanied by an increase instead of a decrease in NO release. In animal and isolated lung studies, endotoxin produces acute lung injury that is associated with increases in cytokines and inducible NOS mRNA expression, suggesting that NO is toxic to the lung in endotoxin shock. Recently, we reported several rare cases that indicate that ARDS in patients with Japanese B encephalitis, lymphangitis with breast cancer and fat embolism is caused by different mechanisms. Our early and recent studies on ARDS and PE may provide information for clinical practice and the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid and efficient method for preparing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-Cov) nucleocapsid (N) protein. METHODS: BALB/c mice were injected with the recombinant N protein of SARS-Cov into the foot-pads for the immunization, and the popliteal lymph nodes were isolated 15 d later for mAb-producing hybridomas, from which the mAbs against the N protein of SARS-Cov were screened. The identification of the mAb against the N protein of SARS-Cov was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent-antibody assay (IFA), and Western immunoblotting. RESULTS: Four strains of hybridomas were obtained that produced the mAb specific to the N protein without detectable cross-reactivity with other pathogens. Of the 4 strains, 2 were identified as the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) isotype, 1 IgG2a, and the other IgG2b, with affinity constants (Ka) of 2 of the strains being 4.14 x 10(-9)M and 3.19 x 10(-9)M respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the preparation of mAb that is specific to the SARS-Cov, and the high-specificity and high-affinity mAb produced by the 4 strains of hybridomas provide a basis for further researches on the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of SARS.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess serum antibody responses of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to nucleocapsid (N) antigen of SARS-associated coronavirus. METHODS: The serum levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to N antigen were measured in 200 healthy blood donors and 13 SARS patients at different time points of acute and convalescent phases using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with N fusion proteins of SARS-associated coronaviruses. RESULTS: The IgM positive critical value of 0.233 and IgG of 0.239 were selected as the threshold value for positive results that equals the product of 2.1 and the mean IgM and IgG levels of 200 healthy blood donors. In 13 patients with SARS, the antibody responses to N antigen were not detectable in the first week after the onset of symptoms. The IgM and IgG seroprotection rates were 83.3{\%} and 66.7{\%} respectively in the second week, both reaching 100{\%} at the third week. IgM seroprotection rates was 61.5{\%} in the second month, and 38.5{\%} at third month. The IgG peaked one month after the onset and remained at high levels in the following 2 months. CONCLUSION: The antibody responses suggest that N protein of SARS is immunodominant and plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. This ELISA-based test for detecting anti- N antigen may be of significant value for SARS diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was diagnosed in Hong Kong in over 1700 patients between March and early June 2003. METHODS: 115 patients diagnosed with SARS were admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, a large regional hospital in Hong Kong, from March 2003, of whom 100 were either discharged or were dead at 31 May. The patients were prospectively studied after admission to assess their short term outcomes and the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes, defined as death or the need for mechanical ventilation RESULTS: At the time of writing 18 patients had died, with a crude mortality rate of 15.7{\%} and a 21 day mortality of 10{\%} (standard error 3{\%}). Thirty nine patients (34{\%}) were admitted to the intensive care unit, 30 of whom (26{\%}) required mechanical ventilation. Multivariate analysis showed that age above 60 (hazards ratio (HR) 3.5, 95{\%} CI 1.2 to 10.2; p=0.02), presence of diabetes mellitus or heart disease (HR 9.1, 95{\%} CI 2.8 to 29.1; p{\textless}0.001), and the presence of other comorbid conditions (HR 5.2, 95{\%} CI 1.4 to 19.7; p=0.01) were independently associated with mortality. However, only the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac disease (HR 7.3, 95{\%} CI 3.1 to 17.4; p{\textless}0.001) was associated with adverse outcomes as a whole. CONCLUSION: SARS is a new disease entity that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Specific clinical and laboratory parameters predicting unfavourable outcomes have been identified.},

According to World Health Organisation (WHO) this appears to be the first severe and easily transmissible new disease to emerge in the 21st century. Though much about the disease remains poorly understood, including the details of the causative virus, we do know that it has features that allow it to spread rapidly along international air travel routes. As of 10 May 2003, a cumulative 7296 probable SARS cases with 526 deaths have been reported from 30 countries on three continents (WHO, ProMED). In the past week, more than 1000 new probable cases and 96 deaths were reported globally. This represents an increase of 119 new cases and 8 new deaths compared with 9 May 2003 (China (85), Taiwan (23), and Hong Kong (7) represented the overwhelming majority, with one additional case each reported from France, Malaysia, Singapore, and the United States).

However, there is no single classification scheme that takes all features, including conduction velocity, cell body diameter, ganglionic origin, and stimuli to which they respond (modality) into account. At present, bronchopulmonary afferent nerves are typically considered to belong to one of three general categories, namely C-fibres, rapidly adapting stretch receptors (RARs), and slowly adapting stretch receptors (SARs). As our understanding of bronchopulmonary afferent nerves continues to deepen, we are likely to see more sophisticated classification schemes emerge. It is clear that the function of afferent fibres can be substantively influenced by airway inflammation and remodelling. The perturbations and perversions of afferent nerve function that occur during these states almost certainly contributes to many of the signs and symptoms of inflammatory airway disease. A more lucid characterization of bronchopulmonary afferent nerves, and a better understanding of the mechanisms by which these nerves influence pulmonary physiology during health and disease anticipates future research.},

abstract = {France has experienced two waves of major terrorist bombings since 1980. In the first wave (1985-1986), eight bombings occurred in Paris, killing 13 and injuring 281. In the second wave (1995-1996), six bombings occurred in Paris and Lyon, killing 10 and injuring 262. Based on lessons learned during these events, France has developed and improved a sophisticated national system for prehospital emergency response to conventional terrorist attacks based on its national emergency medical services (EMS) system, Service d'Aide Medicale Urgente (SAMU). According to the national plan for the emergency medical response to mass-casualty events (White Plan), the major phases of EMS response are: (1) alert; (2) search and rescue; (3) triage of victims and provision of critical care to first priority victims; (4) regulated dispatch of victims to hospitals; and (5) psychological assistance. Following the 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, a national plan for the emergency response to chemical and biological events (PIRATOX) was implemented. In 2002, the Ministries of Health and the Interior collaborated to produce a comprehensive national plan (BIOTOX) for the emergency response to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear events. Key aspects of BIOTOX are the prehospital provision of specialized advance life support for toxic injuries and the protection of responders in contaminated environments. BIOTOX was successfully used during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in France.},

abstract = {The synthesis, pharmacological evaluation, and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of a series of novel arylalkylpiperazines structurally related to BP897 (3) are described. In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.},

abstract = {The aetiologic agent of the recent epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a positive-stranded RNA virus (SARS-CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family and its genome differs substantially from those of other known coronaviruses. SARS-CoV is transmissible mainly by the respiratory route and to date there is no vaccine and no prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against this agent. A SARS-CoV whole-genome approach has been developed aimed at determining the crystal structure of all of its proteins or domains. These studies are expected to greatly facilitate drug design. The genomes of coronaviruses are between 27 and 31.5 kbp in length, the largest of the known RNA viruses, and encode 20-30 mature proteins. The functions of many of these polypeptides, including the Nsp9-Nsp10 replicase-cleavage products, are still unknown. Here, the cloning, Escherichia coli expression, purification and crystallization of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 protein, the first SARS-CoV protein to be crystallized, are reported. Nsp9 crystals diffract to 2.8 A resolution and belong to space group P6(1/5)22, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 89.7, c = 136.7 A. With two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the solvent content is 60{\%} (V(M) = 3.1 A(3) Da(-1)).},

abstract = {The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a new life-threatening respiratory disease which has its origins in Guangdong province, China, where the earliest known cases were identified in November 2002. Since then, probable cases of SARS have been reported in 30 countries and the current cumulative number of cases is 8,240 with 745 deaths and a global fatality rate of 9{\%}. The most frequently involved areas include China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Vietnam and Philippines. Most cases of SARS to date have occurred in young adults and this disease appears to spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact, involving exposure to infectious droplets and body fluids. This transmission pattern generally involves household members, health care workers and international travellers, while a large and sudden cluster of almost simultaneous cases in an housing estate of Hong Kong has raised the possibility of transmission from an environmental source. The most common presenting symptoms are fever, malaise, non-productive cough and dyspnea, associated with pulmonary interstitial infiltrates on chest radiography. A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the laboratory evidences indicate that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS, but the role of other concurrent viral agents (such as metapneumovirus) identified in these patients requires further investigation.},

Experiments consisted of 24-h incubations of one copepod and 10 larvae without extra food at 16 degrees C and 26 degrees C. Nine replicates were considered for each species and temperature. Predation rates (larvae per copepod per day) were: M. mendocinus (1.8), M. grandis (3.1), E. neumani (3.8), A. robustus (3.8), Ma. albidus (6.1) and Me. longisetus (7.0). There was a significant effect of both species and temperature on predation: all species experienced higher predation at 26 degrees C than at 16 degrees C, except for A. robustus whose predation rate was similar at both temperatures. These observations are consistent with previous results that point to Macrocyclops and Mesocyclops genera as important larval predators and suggest the need for field trials to evaluate the response of Ma. albidus and Me. longisetus under natural conditions in Uruguay.},

As an infectious disease spreading through the respiratory tract, SARS is featured by the inconsistency between its clinical representations, physical signs of the lungs and chest imaging findings. It has been shown that atypical pneumonia (AP), with similar clinical features to SARS, has been identified in Guangzhou, China, long before the prevalence of SARS, a fact that urges further understanding of SARS in regard to its incidence and variable clinical courses, for its differential diagnosis with such diseases as AP, influenza-related pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, fungal and cytomegalovirus pneumonia. Information sharing among the medical institutes and training of the first-line medical staff for their better understanding and awareness of SARS and AP is crucial in the clinical practice, to insure timely case identification and avoid "oversensitive" diagnosis. Consultation of particular cases involving experts from multiple medical science fields should be encouraged, which is also an effective measure against newly emerged infectious diseases.},

abstract = {China holds the key to solving many questions crucial to global control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The disease appears to have originated in Guangdong Province, and the causative agent, SARS coronavirus, is likely to have originated from an animal host, perhaps sold in public markets. Epidemiologic findings, integral to defining an animal-human linkage, may be confirmed by laboratory studies; once animal host (s) are confirmed, interventions may be needed to prevent further animal-to-human transmission. Community seroprevalence studies may help determine the basis for the decline in disease incidence in Guangdong Province after February 2002. China will also be able to contribute key data about how the causative agent is transmitted and how it is evolving, as well as identifying pivotal factors influencing disease outcome.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease that first manifested in humans in China in November 2002 and has subsequently spread worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of SARS in the first large group of patients in North America; to describe how these patients were treated and the variables associated with poor outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective case series involving 144 adult patients admitted to 10 academic and community hospitals in the greater Toronto, Ontario, area between March 7 and April 10, 2003, with a diagnosis of suspected or probable SARS. Patients were included if they had fever, a known exposure to SARS, and respiratory symptoms or infiltrates observed on chest radiograph. Patients were excluded if an alternative diagnosis was determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Location of exposure to SARS; features of the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests at admission to the hospital; and 21-day outcomes such as death or intensive care unit (ICU) admission with or without mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Of the 144 patients, 111 (77{\%}) were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting. Features of the clinical examination most commonly found in these patients at admission were self-reported fever (99{\%}), documented elevated temperature (85{\%}), nonproductive cough (69{\%}), myalgia (49{\%}), and dyspnea (42{\%}). Common laboratory features included elevated lactate dehydrogenase (87{\%}), hypocalcemia (60{\%}), and lymphopenia (54{\%}). Only 2{\%} of patients had rhinorrhea. A total of 126 patients (88{\%}) were treated with ribavirin, although its use was associated with significant toxicity, including hemolysis (in 76{\%}) and decrease in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL (in 49{\%}). Twenty-nine patients (20{\%}) were admitted to the ICU with or without mechanical ventilation, and 8 patients died (21-day mortality, 6.5{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.9{\%}-11.8{\%}). Multivariable analysis showed that the presence of diabetes (relative risk [RR], 3.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.4-7.2; P =.01) or other comorbid conditions (RR, 2.5; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-5.8; P =.03) were independently associated with poor outcome (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of cases in the SARS outbreak in the greater Toronto area were related to hospital exposure. In the event that contact history becomes unreliable, several features of the clinical presentation will be useful in raising the suspicion of SARS. Although SARS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with diabetes or other comorbid conditions, the vast majority (93.5{\%}) of patients in our cohort survived.},

METHODS: Eighty-five SARS patients of rehabilitation stage were enrolled in the clinical study. They were divided into the IMT group (62 patients received serial Chinese recipes and western medicine) and the control group (23 patients received western medicine alone). The serial Chinese recipes were given according to patients' syndrome, one dose per day for oral intake for 3 weeks. QOF scoring in patients was observed. RESULTS: QOF scoring in the IMT group before treatment was not significantly different from that in the control group. After 3 weeks treatment, it improved to some extent in both groups, but the improvement in the IMT group was superior to that in the control group in respect of total score and score of psychologic emotional factors. CONCLUSION: Serial Chinese recipe could improve QOF of rehabilitation stage in SARS patients.},

abstract = {Beijing has been one of the epicenters attacked most severely by the SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus) since the first patient was diagnosed in one of the city's hospitals. We now report complete genome sequences of the BJ Group, including four isolates (Isolates BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, and BJ04) of the SARS-CoV. It is remarkable that all members of the BJ Group share a common haplotype, consisting of seven loci that differentiate the group from other isolates published to date. Among 42 substitutions uniquely identified from the BJ group, 32 are non-synonymous changes at the amino acid level. Rooted phylogenetic trees, proposed on the basis of haplotypes and other sequence variations of SARS-CoV isolates from Canada, USA, Singapore, and China, gave rise to different paradigms but positioned the BJ Group, together with the newly discovered GD01 (GD-Ins29) in the same clade, followed by the H-U Group (from Hong Kong to USA) and the H-T Group (from Hong Kong to Toronto), leaving the SP Group (Singapore) more distant. This result appears to suggest a possible transmission path from Guangdong to Beijing/Hong Kong, then to other countries and regions.},

The modes of transmission include droplet spread, close contact, and Fomites; shedding of virus from respiratory tract is the primary mode of transmission. SARS clinically presents with high-grade fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, headache, cough with or without sputum production, dyspnea, and dizziness. Chest radiographs reveal unilateral or bilateral, predominantly peripheral, areas of consolidation progressing with in a short time of bilateral patchy consolidation. Preliminary reports suggest a milder illness in young children. The case definition of probable SARS cases, laboratory investigations and precautions for prevention of spread are discussed.},

We are all starting to dig out, and this process will take many months at a minimum and we may never completely return to the way we were.

abstract = {The recent outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as a new viral disease is causing a great concern for health authorities and general population. Very little is known about the infectious agent (a coronavirus) and its etiopathogeny, having no specific treatment yet. Proinflammatory cytokines released by stimulated macrophages in the alveoli could have a prominent role in pathogenesis of SARS. Current treatment of SARS with antiviral agents such as ribavirin and corticosteroids have not achieved very satisfactory results. Corticosteroids exert an antiinflammatory effect and are indicated for the treatment of respiratory distress, but, in the other hand, they exert an immunosuppressor effect on humoral and cellular arms of Immune System. Based on previous reports and on our own experience in HIV, we propose here pentoxifylline (PTX), a drug commonly used in vascular indications, as a possible treatment for SARS due to its interesting properties. PTX would feature a possible antiviral activity along with a well-known cytokine-modulating activity not as immunosuppressant as that of the corticoids, down-regulating proinflammatory cytokines but leaving functional the rest of the immune response. Other effects of PTX are discussed, as bronchodilation. CONCLUSIONS: The antiinflammatory, antiviral, immunomodulatory and bronchodilatory effects of PTX, along with its low cost and toxicity, make it a promising drug to be considered for SARS treatment, alone or as an adjuvant therapy in combination with other drugs. The classical antiviral approach as single treatment for viral diseases should be reviewed in this occasion; immunomodulatory therapies could play an important role in SARS therapy.},

abstract = {Over 15 years ago, the Benner group noticed that the DNA alphabet need not be limited to the four standard nucleotides known in natural DNA. Rather, twelve nucleobases forming six base pairs joined by mutually exclusive hydrogen bonding patterns are possible within the geometry of the Watson-Crick pair (Fig. 1). Synthesis and studies on these compounds have brought us to the threshold of a synthetic biology, an artificial chemical system that does basic processes needed for life (in particular, Darwinian evolution), but with unnatural chemical structures. At the same time, the artificial genetic information systems (AEGIS) that we have developed have been used in FDA-approved commercial tests for managing HIV and hepatitis C infections in individual patients, and in a tool that seeks the virus for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). AEGIS also supports the next generation of robotic probes to search for genetic molecules on Mars, Europa, and elsewhere where NASA probes will travel.},

abstract = {As the first emerging epidemic of the 21st century, SARS has raised much interest and fear among statesmen, economists, and the general public, as well as within the medical community. This new disease is characterized by several daunting challenges, including person-to-person transmission, an environmentally resistant agent, a non-specific clinical presentation, and a high fatality rate among high risk individuals. In Israel, as elsewhere, public health authorities were forced to quickly design appropriate measures to confront this new threat. The Israeli guidelines for surveillance, epidemiologic investigation and intervention in the event of a SARS outbreak were drafted in the absence of complete data on some of the most basic epidemiologic characteristics of the disease. Discrepancies between published guidelines from several countries made the decision-making process even more complicated. We describe the epidemiologic guidelines for SARS drafted by the Israeli working group, as well as the considerations on which they are based. The recent experience with this new outbreak has already provided several valuable lessons on policy making which may help future planning for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has only recently been described. We provide individual patient data on the clinical course, treatment and complications experienced by 14 front-line health care workers and hospital support staff in Toronto who were diagnosed with SARS, and we provide follow-up information for up to 3 weeks after their discharge from hospital. METHODS: As part of the initial response to the SARS outbreak in Toronto, our health care centre was asked to establish a SARS unit for health care workers who were infected. Patients were admitted to this unit and were closely monitored and treated until they were well enough to be discharged. We prospectively compiled information on their clinical course, management and complications and followed them for 3 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: The 11 women and 3 men described here (mean age 42 [standard deviation [SD] 9] years) were all involved in providing medical or ancillary hospital services to patients who were later found to have SARS. Onset of symptoms in 4 of our patients who could clearly identify only a single contact with a patient with SARS occurred on average 4 (SD 3) days after exposure. For the remaining 10 patients with multiple patient contacts, symptom onset followed exposure by a mean of 3.5 (SD 3) days after their exposure. All patients were treated with ribavirin, and all patients received levofloxacin. Many experienced major complications. Dyspnea was present in 12 patients during their stay in hospital, and all developed abnormalities on chest radiograph; 3 patients developed severe hypoxemia (PaO(2) {\textless} 50 mm Hg). All patients experienced a drop in hemoglobin. Nine patients had hemolytic anemia. Three patients experienced numbness and tingling in their hands and feet, and 2 developed frank tetany. All 3 had magnesium levels that were less than 0.1 mmol/L. All patients recovered and were discharged home. At a follow-up examination 3 weeks after discharge (5 weeks after onset of illness), all patients were no longer weak but continued to become fatigued easily and had dyspnea on minimal exertion. For 5 patients, chest radiographs still showed residual disease. INTERPRETATION: SARS is a very serious illness even in healthy, relatively young people. The clinical course in our patients, all of whom met the case definition for SARS (which requires pulmonary involvement), resulted in dyspnea and, in some individuals, severe hypoxemia. Severe hemolytic anemia may be a feature of SARS or may be a complication of therapy, possibly with ribavirin.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the initial experience regarding thin-section computed tomographic (CT) findings in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who improved clinically after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients (10 men, 14 women; mean age, 39 years; age range, 23-70 years) with confirmed SARS underwent follow-up thin-section CT of the thorax. The scans were obtained on average 36.5 days after hospital admission and were analyzed for parenchymal abnormality (ground-glass opacification, consolidation, or interstitial thickening) and evidence of fibrosis (parenchymal band, traction bronchiectasis, irregular interfaces). Patients were assigned to group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis) for analysis. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, rate of intensive care unit admission, peak lactate dehydrogenase level, pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, and peak opacification on chest radiographs were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was found in 96{\%} (23 of 24) of patients and ranged from residual ground-glass opacification and interstitial thickening in group 2 (nine of 24, 38{\%}) to fibrosis in group 1 (15 of 24, 62{\%}). Patients in group 1 were older (mean age, 45 vs 30.3 years), had a higher rate of intensive care unit admission (27{\%} [four of 15] vs 11{\%} [one of nine]), more requirement for pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (87{\%}, [13 of 15] vs 67{\%} [six of nine]), higher peak lactate dehydrogenase level (438.9 vs 355.6 U/L), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (estimated area, 14{\%} vs 11{\%}) than patients in group 2. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary fibrosis may develop early in patients with SARS who have been discharged after treatment. Patients who are older and have more severe disease during treatment are more likely to develop thin-section CT findings of fibrosis.},

abstract = {A novel coronavirus has been identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The viral main proteinase (Mpro, also called 3CLpro), which controls the activities of the coronavirus replication complex, is an attractive target for therapy. We determined crystal structures for human coronavirus (strain 229E) Mpro and for an inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus [transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)] Mpro, and we constructed a homology model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) Mpro. The structures reveal a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding sites, which is further supported by recombinant SARS-CoV Mpro-mediated cleavage of a TGEV Mpro substrate. Molecular modeling suggests that available rhinovirus 3Cpro inhibitors may be modified to make them useful for treating SARS.},

The nonspecific signs and symptoms of this disease, coupled with a relatively long incubation period and the initial absence of a reliable diagnostic test, limited the understanding of the magnitude of the outbreak. This paper outlines our experience with public health issues that have arisen during this outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. We confirmed that case detection, reporting, clear and timely dissemination of information, and strict infection control measures are essential in handling such an infectious disease outbreak. The need for an outbreak response unit is crucial to combat any future outbreak.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a new disease in human beings, first recognised in late February, 2003, in Hanoi, Vietnam. The severity of the disease, combined with its rapid spread along international air-travel routes, prompted WHO to set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to try to identify the causal agent and develop a diagnostic test. The network unites laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfil all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of a disease. Results are shared in real time via a secure website, on which microscopy pictures, protocols for testing, and PCR primer sequences are also posted. Findings are discussed in daily teleconferences. Progress is further facilitated through sharing between laboratories of samples and test materials. The network has identified a new coronavirus, consistently detected in samples of SARS patients from several countries, and conclusively named it as the causative agent of SARS; the strain is unlike any other known member of the genus Coronavirus. Three diagnostic tests are now available, but all have limitations.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in Toronto in a woman who returned from Hong Kong on February 23, 2003 (1). Transmission to other persons resulted subsequently in an outbreak among 257 persons in several Greater Toronto Area (GTA) hospitals. After implementation of provincewide public health measures that included strict infection-control practices, the number of recognized cases of SARS declined substantially, and no cases were detected after April 20. On April 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) lifted a travel advisory issued on April 22 that had recommended limiting travel to Toronto. This report describes a second wave of SARS cases among patients, visitors, and health-care workers (HCWs) that occurred at a Toronto hospital approximately 4 weeks after SARS transmission was thought to have been interrupted. The findings indicate that exposure to hospitalized patients with unrecognized SARS after a provincewide relaxation of strict SARS control measures probably contributed to transmission among HCWs. The investigation underscores the need for monitoring fever and respiratory symptoms in hospitalized patients and visitors, particularly after a decline in the number of reported SARS cases.},

Subsequent cases at eight hospitals have been associated with exposures at hospital A. Previously, all reported cases had been associated with persons recently returning to Taiwan from SARS-affected regions. This report summarizes epidemiologic findings of the outbreak in Taiwan and describes the impact of health-care--associated transmission of SARS.},

abstract = {On July 5, 2003, Taiwan was removed from the World Health Organization (WHO) list of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected countries. As of July 9, a total of 671 probable cases of SARS had been reported in Taiwan. On February 21, the first identified SARS patient in Taiwan returned from travel to Guangdong Province, mainland China, by way of Hong Kong. Initial efforts to control SARS appeared to be effective; these efforts included isolation of suspect and probable SARS patients, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health-care workers (HCWs) and visitors, and quarantine of contacts of known SARS patients. However, beginning in mid-April, unrecognized cases of SARS led to a large nosocomial cluster and subsequent SARS-associated coronavirus transmission to other health-care facilities and community settings. In response to the growing epidemic, additional measures were taken to limit nosocomial and community transmission of SARS, including more widespread use of quarantine. By the end of the epidemic, 131,132 persons had been placed in quarantine, including 50,319 close contacts of SARS patients and 80,813 travelers from WHO-designated SARS-affected areas. This report describes the quarantine measures used in Taiwan and discusses the need for further evaluation of quarantine and other control measures used to prevent SARS.},

Although there is considerable information and guidance available on many aspects of SARS, very little exists on this particular topic. What's more, we have found significant differences in the perspectives and recommendations of some of the experts on the subject. This article provides guidance for clinical engineering, respiratory therapy, and other personnel involved in maintaining potentially SARS-exposed equipment. To derive our recommendations, we reviewed the material posted on the Web sites of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), along with other information sources; we also discussed issues related to equipment use and servicing with experts outside ECRI.},

METHODS: Specific antibodies of IgM and IgG against SARS virus in 267 serum specimens from patients with SARS and 132 from non-SARS patients or healthy persons were assayed with IFA or ELISA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were used to evaluate the significance of the antibodies in diagnosis of SARS. The concordance of different measurements was tested with Kappa. RESULTS: The positive rate of specific IgM and IgG detected by IFA increased sharply on the eleventh day of the disease. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of IgM in diagnosis of SARS on eleventh day or later were 65.6{\%}, 100.0{\%}, 100.0{\%}, 71.0{\%} and 81.3{\%}, respectively, and IgG were 91.1{\%}, 97.0{\%} 97.3{\%}, 90.1{\%}, and 93.8{\%}, respectively. Similar results could be seen when IgM and IgG were detected by ELISA. The Kappa of IFA and ELISA for IgM and IgG were 0.640 and 0.779 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The antibodies against SARS virus can be detected in the mid-and late stage of SARS. The antibodies can be used in the serological diagnosis of SARS. There is high concordance of IFA and ELISA results in measurement of SARS antibodies.},

RESULTS: The levels of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in SARS group [(589 +/- 435) x 10(6)/L, (316 +/- 267) x 10(6)/L and (215 +/- 165) x 10(6)/L, respectively] were significantly lower than those of the normal group (P {\textless} 0.01). When compared the SARS group with AIDS group, we found the level of CD4(+) T-lymphocyte in the former was higher (P {\textless} 0.01), while the CD3(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes were lower (P {\textless} 0.01). There were 54 (44{\%}) patients in SARS group and 39 (76{\%}) patients in AIDS group showed low levels of CD4(+) T-lymphocyte ({\textless} 200 x 10(6)/L). The count of T-lymphocyte subsets of SARS group decreased to the lowest level during the 10(th) and 12(th) day after the onset of symptoms. Both serum IgG and IgE in SARS group [(15.1 +/- 8.5) g/L and (0.6 +/- 0.9) g/L, respectively] were higher than those of the normal group. CONCLUSION: The levels of CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of SARS patients decrease significantly and go down to the lowest point at days 10 approximately 12 after onset of the disease.},

The needed equipment includes clothing; footwear; such protective devices as masks, safety glasses, and gloves; disinfectant solutions; laboratory equipment; and materials for obtaining and transporting samples. Prepared by the Western Pacific Regional Office of the World Health Organization, this list will help implement measures to contain the epidemic. The list gives the recommended quantities, specifications for the items, and possible alternatives for some items. This list of equipment is not exhaustive; it is intended to provide a small emergency supply for a period of 3 or 4 days for a single isolation unit with approximately 50 workers. To guarantee the availability of the equipment in the needed quantities, infection control authorities should take into account the number of isolation units needed and the length of time that containment measures will need to be in place. Adequate reserves should be available 24 hours a day, and plans should be made for rapid access to larger stocks in the event of a larger outbreak.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dynamic changes observed in serum levels of interleukins (ILs), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. METHODS: Sixty-one cases of SARS with positive antibodies to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were classified into the following categories: initial stage (3 - 7 days), peak stage (8 - 14 days), and remission and recovery stage (15 - 27 days). Forty-four healthy individuals were used as controls. Serum levels of ILs, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 were measured in all subjects. Serum antibodies to SARS-CoV were detected only in SARS cases. RESULTS: The mean concentration of serum IL-6 in SARS patients did not differ from that in the control group in initial and peak stages, but became significantly higher in remission and recovery stage compared with the control group, initial and peak stages (P {\textless} 0.01). The mean concentration of serum IL-8 in SARS patients did not differ from that of the control group in initial stage, but was significantly higher than control group in peak stage and remission and recovery stage (P {\textless} 0.05). And it was more significantly higher in remission and recovery stage than in peak stage (P {\textless} 0.01). The mean concentrations of IL-16 and TNF-alpha in SARS patients were higher than those of the control group for every length of the clinical courses investigated, and were especially high in remission and recovery stage (P {\textless} 0.01). SARS patients experienced higher concentration of serum IL-13 compared with the controls in initial stage (P {\textless} 0.01), but returned to normal levels in peak stage and in remission and recovery stage. The mean concentration of serum IL-18 in SARS patients was significantly lower than that of the control group during all clinical courses (P {\textless} 0.05). The mean concentration of serum TGF-beta1 in SARS patients was higher than that of the control group during all clinical courses. Although TGF-beta1 in serum decreased in remission and recovery stage in SARS patients, the average was still higher than that of the control group (P {\textless} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Most proinflammatory cytokines and TGF-beta 1 were elevated during the early phase of SARS, which may be associated with lung infiltration and proliferation. Concurrently, the mean concentration of serum IL-13 decreased gradually, and the mean concentration of serum IL-18 level in SARS patients was lower than that of the control group during all the courses of SARS, suggesting that the immune state of the patients with SARS was obviously abnormal. Observing the dynamic changes in blood cytokine levels can provide a scientific basis to assess pathogenesis and efficacy of clinical treatment of SARS.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases are a global hazard that puts every nation and every person at risk. The recent SARS outbreak is a prime example. Knowing neither geographic nor political borders, often arriving silently and lethally, microbial pathogens constitute a grave threat to the health of humans. Indeed, a majority of countries recently identified the spread of infectious disease as the greatest global problem they confront. Throughout history, humans have struggled to control both the causes and consequences of infectious diseases and we will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. Following up on a high-profile 1992 report from the Institute of Medicine, Microbial Threats to Health examines the current state of knowledge and policy pertaining to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases from around the globe. It examines the spectrum of microbial threats, factors in disease emergence, and the ultimate capacity of the United States to meet the challenges posed by microbial threats to human health. From the impact of war or technology on disease emergence to the development of enhanced disease surveillance and vaccine strategies, Microbial Threats to Health contains valuable information for researchers, students, health care providers, policymakers, public health officials. and the interested public.},
