abstract = {BACKGROUND Tamoxifen citrate is a very prevalent drug marketed under several trade names like Apo-Tamox, Nolvadex, Tamec, Tamizam and Tamoplex. This molecule is approved by the FDA for breast cancer treatment. Some studies have shown that tamoxifen has anti-tuberculosis and anti-parasitic activities. Like any drug tamoxifen possesses side effects, more or less dangerous. AIMS Basically, this work is a comparative study which aims to: Primarily compare the antimicrobial and antitumor activities of tamoxifen and a newly synthesized tamoxifen analogue. Secondly, determine the molecule with lesser side effects. METHODS Three groups of mice were injected with tamoxifen citrate and compound 2(1,1-bis[4-(3- dimethylaminopropoxy)phenyl]-2-phenyl-but-1-ene dihydrochloride) at doses corresponding to C1 (1/10), C2 (1/50), C3 (1/100) to compound 2 lethal dose (LD50 = 75 mg/kg) administered for adult mice. A group of not injected mice has served as a study control. RESULTS Experimental results suggest that compound 2 have better antitumor and antimicrobial activity than tamoxifen citrate besides its lower toxicity effects. CONCLUSION The results emerged from the present study confirmed the antitumor and antimicrobial effect of tamoxifen citrate and its hematological side effects. Compound 2 seems to be more effective than tamoxifen citrate for antitumor and antimicrobial treatment while having less hematological side effects and less disruption of the blood biochemical parameters. These findings encourage us to push further studies for compound 2 and test it for other therapeutic usage for which tamoxifen was effective.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a globally widespread disease, with approximately a quarter of the world's population currently infected (WHO, 2018). Some risk factors, such as HIV status, nutrition and body mass index, have already been thoroughly investigated. However, little attention has been given to behavioural and/or psychological risk factors such as stress and education level. This study investigated the risk factors for TB diagnosis by statistical analyses of publicly available data from the most recent wave of the Indonesian Family Life survey (IFLS-5) conducted in 2015. Out of 34,249 respondents there were 328 who reported having TB. For comparison and completeness, variables were divided into levels: individual-, household- and community-level variables. The most prominent and interesting variables found to influence TB diagnosis status (on each level) were investigated, and a logistic regression was subsequently developed to understand the extent to which each risk factor acts as a predictor for being diagnosed with TB. Age, health benefit or insurance, stress at work and living in a rural area all showed significant association with TB diagnosis status. This study's findings suggest that suitable control measures, such as schemes for improving mental health/stress reduction and improved access to health care in rural areas should be implemented in Indonesia to address each of the key factors identified.},

abstract = {Statistical shape analysis of lung is a reliable alternative method for diagnosing pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB). The 2D contour-based lung shape analysis is investigated and developed using Fourier descriptors (FDs). The proposed 2D lung shape analysis is carried out in threefold: (1) represent the normal and the abnormal (i.e. pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB)) lung shape models using Fourier descriptors modeling (FDM) framework from chest X-ray (CXR) images, (2) estimate and compare the 2D inter-patient lung shape variations for the normal and abnormal lungs by applying principal component analysis (PCA) techniques, and (3) describe the optimal type of contour-based feature vectors to train a classifier in order to detect TB using one publicly available dataset-namely the Montgomery dataset. Since almost all of the previous works in lung shape analysis are content-based analysis, we proposed contour-based lung shape analysis for statistical modeling and feature description of PTB cases. The results show that the proposed approach is able to explain more than 95{\%} of total variations in both of the normal and PTB cases using only 6 and 7 principal component modes for the right and the left lungs, respectively. In case of PTB detection, using 138 lung cases (80 normal and 58 PTB cases), we achieved the accuracy (ACC) and the area under the curve (AUC) of 82.03{\%} and 88.75{\%}, respectively. In comparison with existing state-of-art studies in the same dataset, the proposed approach is a very promising supplement for diagnosis of PTB disease. The method is robust and valuable for application in 2D automatic segmentation, classification, and atlas registration. Moreover, the approach could be used for any kind of pulmonary diseases.

The national coverage for the vaccinations given at birth was 97.1{\%}, dropping to 94.3{\%}, 87.7{\%} and 83.6{\%} at ages 3, 5 and 12 months. Among children eligible for the Measles, Mumps and Rubella-vaccinations, the national coverage was 76.9{\%} for children aged 15 months and 64.1{\%} for children aged 4 years, but dropping to 40.9{\%} in the districts. At preschool, the national coverage was 79.9{\%}. Among the 12-year-old, the national coverages of the two vaccinations against Human Papilloma Virus were 88.4{\%} and 71.6{\%}, respectively, and for the three Hepatitis B-vaccinations 89.8{\%}, 84.1{\%} and 69.6{\%}. A subgroup-analysis and test of an SMS-reminder system in Nuuk improved the coverage from 57.8{\%} to 75.5{\%} locally. Overall, we found a high national coverage rate among the newborn in Greenland.

abstract = {Although 23{\%} of world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), only 5-10{\%} manifest the disease. Individuals surely exposed to M. tb that remain asymptomatic are considered potential latent TB (LTB) cases. Such asymptomatic M. tb.-exposed individuals represent a reservoir for active TB cases. Although accurate discrimination and early treatment of patients with active TB and asymptomatic M. tb.-exposed individuals are necessary to control TB, identifying those individuals at risk of developing active TB still remains a tremendous clinical challenge. This study aimed to characterize the differences in the serum metabolic profile specifically associated to active TB infected individuals or to asymptomatic M. tb.-exposed population. Interestingly, significant changes in a specific set of metabolites were shared when comparing either asymptomatic house-hold contacts of active TB patients (HHC-TB) or active TB patients (A-TB) to clinically healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, this analysis revealed statistically significant lower serum levels of aminoacids such as alanine, lysine, glutamate and glutamine, and citrate and choline in patients with A-TB, when compared to HHC-TB. The predictive ability of these metabolic changes was also evaluated. Although further validation in independent cohorts and comparison with other pulmonary infectious diseases will be necessary to assess the clinical potential, this analysis enabled the discrimination between HHC-TB and A-TB patients with an AUC value of 0.904 (confidence interval 0.81-1.00, p-value {\textless} 0.0001). Overall, the strategy described in this work could provide a sensitive, specific, and minimally invasive method that could eventually be translated into a clinical tool for TB control.},

Demographic, clinical data, drug-resistance pattern of isolated mycobacteria and treatment outcome was assessed for the patient who completed their treatment in Qatar. Of 3301 patients with positive M. tuberculosis culture were analyzed; 223 (6.7{\%}) were resistant to at least one drug. The overall prevalence of multi-d rug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 1.2{\%} (n = 38) of patients. A former resident of Indian sub contents was the most common demographic characteristic observed (64.1{\%}). The outcome of treatment was assessed for 85 resistant cases with follow-up after completion of treatment. Cure and relapse rates were 97.6{\%}, and 2.4{\%}, respectively. Drug-resistant TB in Qatar is influenced by migration where the patients were probably infected. Rapid sputum sampling performed in the early stages of the disease, patient isolation, and drug-susceptibility testing should be the standard of care.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis has been declared as a global emergency. Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a state in which host immunity cannot completely eradicate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cigarette smoke increases the risk of respiratory infections, such a TB, as it has adverse effects on respiratory immune function. In this cross-sectional study, which was performed from 2016 to 2017, 31 patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer, 63 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 46 with problems in respiratory system, and 40 healthy subjects were studied. Demographic data of all subjects were recorded via a questionnaire. IGRAs (Interferon-$\gamma$ release assays) were used to determine LTBI. We showed that smoking has significant odds ratio for COPD patients (OR: 4.58, 95{\%} CI: 1.93-10.87). Also, the concordance of smoking with COPD (OR: 22, 95{\%} CI: 2.7-179.2), lung cancer (OR: 10, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-97), and other respiratory diseases (OR: 4.54, 95{\%} CI: 1.93-10.87) is a significant risk factor for the presence of LTBI whereas the existence of LTBI in the study groups did not show any significant odds ratio. This study is the first to analyze the relationship between smoking in patients with respiratory diseases and LTBI susceptibility in Iran by IGRAs, which proposes cigarette smoking as a powerful risk factor for LTBI.},

abstract = {Ethionamide (ETA), an isonicotinic acid derivative, is part of the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) regimen. The current guidelines have deprioritized ETA because it is potentially less effective than other agents. Our aim was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model and simulate ETA dosing regimens in order to assess target attainment. This study included subjects from four different sites, including healthy volunteers and patients with MDR-TB. The TB centers included were two in the United States and one in Bangladesh. Patients who received ETA and had at least one drug concentration reported were included. The population PK model was developed, regimens with a total of 1,000 to 2,250 mg daily were simulated, and target attainment using published MICs and targets of 1.0-log kill and resistance suppression was assessed with the Pmetrics R package. We included 1,167 ethionamide concentrations from 94 subjects. The final population model was a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and absorption with a lag time. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) final population parameter estimates were as follows: absorption rate constant, 1.02 (1.11) h(-1); elimination rate constant, 0.69 (0.46) h(-1); volume of distribution, 104.16 (59.87) liters; lag time, 0.43 (0.32) h. A total daily dose of 1,500 mg or more was needed for ≥90{\%} attainment of the 1.0-log kill target at a MIC of 1 mg/liter, and 2,250 mg/day led to 80{\%} attainment of the resistance suppression target at a MIC of 0.5 mg/liter. In conclusion, we developed a population PK model and assessed target attainment for different ETA regimens. Patients may not be able to tolerate the doses needed to achieve the predefined targets supporting the current recommendations for ETA deprioritization.},

abstract = {Background: The incidence of TB among Inuit is the highest in Canada. A significantly shorter latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment with rifapentine and isoniazid once weekly for 12 weeks (3HP) is now available in limited settings in Canada.Methods: A prospective open -label 2-year observational postmarketing study was conducted introducing 3HP for the first time in Canada in Iqaluit followed by a program rollout in Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut.Results: A total of 247 people were offered 3HP, 102 in the Iqaluit postmarketing study and 145 in the Qikiqtarjuaq program roll out. Although statistical significance was not reached, more people who started treatment completed treatment in the 3HP group (Iqaluit, 60/73 (82.2{\%}) and Qikiqtarjuaq, 89/115 (77.4{\%})) than in the historical control 9INHgroup (306/420 = 72.9{\%}) (p = 0.2).

Since histidine richness is likely to be involved in metal binding, we attempted to decipher the role of GroEL1 in chelating metals and the consequence on M. tuberculosis physiology. Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that GroEL1 binds copper and other metals. Mycobacterial viability assay, redox balance and DNA-protection assay concluded that GroEL1 protects from copper stress in vitro. Solution X-ray scattering and constrained modeling of GroEL1 -/+ copper ions showed reorientation of the apical domain as seen in functional assembly.

The results showed that methylation plays important roles in immune evasion, pathogenesis, persistence, disease progression, active, drug responder and non-responder. This will inform better practice for the development of new drugs and vaccines to eradicate tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Mammalian infection models have contributed significantly to our understanding of the host-mycobacterial interaction, revealing potential mechanisms and targets for novel antimycobacterial therapeutics. However, the use of conventional mammalian models such as mice, are typically expensive, high maintenance, require specialized animal housing, and are ethically regulated. Furthermore, research using Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is inherently difficult as work needs to be carried out at biosafety level 3 (BSL3). The insect larvae of Galleria mellonella (greater wax moth), have become increasingly popular as an infection model, and we previously demonstrated its potential as a mycobacterial infection model using Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Here we present a novel BSL2 complaint MTB infection model using G. mellonella in combination with a bioluminescent $\Delta$leuD$\Delta$panCD double auxotrophic mutant of MTB H37Rv (SAMTB lux) which offers safety and practical advantages over working with wild type MTB. Our results show a SAMTB lux dose dependent survival of G. mellonella larvae and demonstrate proliferation and persistence of SAMTB lux bioluminescence over a 1 week infection time course. Histopathological analysis of G. mellonella, highlight the formation of early granuloma-like structures which matured over time. We additionally demonstrate the drug efficacy of first (isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) and second line (moxifloxacin) antimycobacterial drugs. Our findings demonstrate the broad potential of this insect model to study MTB infection under BSL2 conditions. We anticipate that the successful adaptation and implementation of this model will remove the inherent limitations of MTB research at BSL3 and increase tuberculosis research output.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Tuberculosis (TB) is a great mimic of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. This mimicry may pose a challenge, as the management of both diseases is quite different. Furthermore, the temporal association of initiating treatment affects prognosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly infects the pulmonary system. However, in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, it can be a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old man of Indian origin presented with headache and vomiting. He had a brain mass on imaging suggestive of a glioma. He also had lung infiltrates and was diagnosed with a co-infection by SARS-CoV-2, by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the GeneXpert system. The mass was excised and was found to be a tuberculoma, diagnosed by Xpert MTB. He received first-line anti-TB and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia based on local guidelines. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights that COVID-19 can co-exist with other infectious diseases, such as TB. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to detect TB with atypical presentation. A co-infection of pulmonary and CNS TB with COVID-19 can present a diagnostic challenge, and appropriate patient management relies on an accurate and rapid diagnosis. Surgery may be necessary if there are compressive signs and symptoms secondary to CNS TB. A diagnosis of COVID-19 should not delay urgent surgeries. Further studies are needed to understand the effects of COVID-19 on the clinical course of TB.},

The physicians who convened at the Association between 1902 and 1910 shared a concern for the degeneration of the French-Canadian "race" under the effects of alcoholism, tuberculosis, and syphilis. For hygienists such as Arthur Rousseau and Charles-Narcisse Valin, this state of degeneration called for hygienic measures that would help regenerate and improve the French-Canadian race. While their suggestion that marriages be matched scientifically in order to prevent the transmission of hereditary and acquired defects from parent to offspring may be reminiscent of eugenics, French-Canadian physicians had no knowledge of Sir Francis Galton - eugenics' "founding father" - and his work on the topic.

Three kinds of manure [chicken (T2), pig (T4) and cow (T6)] and SS (T8) were inoculated with BSFL (1.2:7 ratio on fresh weight basis) and without BSFL (T1, T3, T5 and T7) was used as control and experiment lasted for 9 days. The results indicated that BSFL amendment 90-93{\%} of PB abundances (RAs) was significantly mitigate in CM and COM (T2 and T6), and 86-88{\%} in PM and SS compost. However, relatively greater abundance of PB was recorded in the T4 and T8 treatments. Most of the PB belong to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes phylum and their community composition varied from phylum to species levels among the all treatments. The PB composition was significantly altered by BSFL amendment and also important role play to enhance in compost quality. Interestingly, Bacillus and Clostridium were significantly very less abundant present in BSFL applied treatments, but considerably higher population of these bacterial genus and its associated species were identifies from control or without BSFL applied treatments. Overall, without BSFL blended-all three kinds of manure-composts have comparatively greater PB abundance than with BSFL applied treatments, as the PB species Listeria{\_}monocytogenes{\_}FSL{\_}R2-503, Staphylococcus{\_}aureus{\_}M0406, Bacillus{\_}anthracis, Listeria{\_}ivanovii, Staphylococcus{\_}aureus{\_}C0673, Salmonella Bacillus{\_}cereus{\_}VD115, Mycobacterium{\_}tuberculosis{\_}FJ05194 and Pseudomonas{\_}aeruginosa has relatively greater RAs, followed by Bartonella{\_}bacilliformis{\_}Ver075; Bordetella{\_}pertussis{\_}2356847; Brucella{\_}melitensis{\_}ADMAS-G1; Klebsiella{\_}pneumoniae{\_}LCT-KP182 and Corynebacterium{\_}jeikeium{\_}K411 respectively.

abstract = {Lipid metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) relies on 34 fatty acid adenylating enzymes (FadDs) that can be grouped into two classes: fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs) involved in lipid and cholesterol catabolism and long chain fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) involved in biosynthesis of the numerous essential and virulence-conferring lipids found in Mtb. The precise biochemical roles of many FACLs remain poorly characterized while the functionally non-redundant FAALs are much better understood. Here we describe the systematic investigation of 5'-O-[N-(alkanoyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine (alkanoyl adenosine monosulfamate, alkanoyl-AMS) analogs as potential multitarget FadD inhibitors for their antitubercular activity and biochemical selectivity towards representative FAAL and FACL enzymes. We identified several potent compounds including 12-azidododecanoyl-AMS 28, 11-phenoxyundecanoyl-AMS 32, and nonyloxyacetyl-AMS 36 with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against M. tuberculosis ranging from 0.098 to 3.13 $\mu$M. Compound 32 was notable for its impressive biochemical selectivity against FAAL28 (apparent K(i) = 0.7 $\mu$M) versus FACL19 (K(i) {\textgreater} 100 $\mu$M), and uniform activity against a panel of multidrug and extensively drug-resistant TB strains with MICs ranging from 3.13 to 12.5 $\mu$M in minimal (GAST) and rich (7H9) media. The SAR analysis provided valuable insights for further optimization of 32 and also identified limitations to overcome.},

abstract = {The problems of parasite resistance, as well as the toxic residues to most of the commercially available antipiroplasmic drugs severely weaken their effective, curative, and environmental safe employment. Therefore, it is clear that the development of treatment options for piroplasmosis is vital for improving disease treatment and control. Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that targets mainly the DNA replication machinery by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase enzymes. As a result, ciprofloxacin is used for treating several bacterial and parasitic infections. In this study, the efficacy of 15 novel ciprofloxacin derivatives (NCD) that had been developed against drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated against piroplasm parasite multiplication in vitro. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of the most effective five compounds of NCD (No. 3, 5, 10, 14, 15) on Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Babesia caballi, and Theileria equi were 32.9, 13.7, 14.9, and 30.9; 14.9, 25.8, 13.6, and 27.5; 34.9, 33.9, 21.1, and 22.3; 26.7, 28.3, 34.5, and 29.1; and 4.7, 26.6, 33.9, and 29.1 $\mu$M, respectively. Possible detrimental effects of tested NCD on host cells were assessed using mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3) and Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell lines. Tested NCD did not suppress NIH/3T3 and MDBK cell viability, even at the highest concentration used (500 $\mu$M). Combination treatments of the identified most effective compounds of NCD/diminazene aceturate (DA), /atovaquone (AQ), and /clofazimine (CF) showed mainly synergistic and additive effects. The IC(50) values of NCD showed that they are promising future candidates against piroplasmosis. Further in vivo trials are required to evaluate the therapeutic potential of NCD.},

METHODS: During 2000-2019, we investigated 892 children with a median age of seven years. We explored associations between TB infection and characteristics such as closeness to contact, age, sex, BCG status and foreign origin. RESULTS: The overall rates were for TB infection 10.2{\%} (n = 91) and for TB disease 1.1{\%} (n = 10). In addition to infectiousness of index case and closeness of contact, foreign background, male sex and increasing age were independently associated with infection. In foreign-born children, the rates of tuberculosis infection and disease were 18.7{\%} and 3.9{\%}, respectively. In 18/46 (39{\%}) infected foreign-born children, a baseline negative tuberculosis test supported a diagnosis of recent infection. CONCLUSION: Foreign background, older age and male sex were associated with infection. In a significant proportion of infected children, a previous negative test made recent infection likely.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk areas of deaths due to unspecified pneumonia and tuberculosis (TB) in children, and to identify if there is a relationship between these events with higher TB incidence and social determinants. METHODS: Ecological study carried out in Brazil. All cases of TB or unspecified pneumonia deaths in children under 5 years of age reported between 2006 and 2016 were included and collected through Department of Informatics of the Unified Health System (Brazil's electronic database). The Spatial Scan Statistics was used to identify areas at higher risk of dying from this event. The spatial association was verified through the Getis-Ord techniques. The Bivariate Moran Global Index was used to verify the spatial autocorrelation between the two events. To identify the association of TB and pneumonia deaths with endemic areas of pulmonary TB and social determinants, four explanatory statistical models were identified. RESULTS: A total of 21 391 cases of pneumonia and 238 cases of TB were identified. Spatial scanning analysis enabled the detection of four clusters of risk for TB (relative risk, RR, between 3.30 and 18.18) and 22 clusters for pneumonia (RR between 1.38 and 5.24). The spatial association of the events was confirmed (z-score 3.74 and 64.34) and spatial autocorrelation between events (Moran Index:0.031 (p=0.001)). The zero-inflated negative binomial distribution was chosen, and an association for both events was identified with the TB incidence rate (OR 5.3, 95{\%} CI 2.85 to 9.84; OR 6.63, 95{\%} CI 5.62 to 7.81), with the Gini Index (OR 1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 2.82; OR 4.22, 95{\%} CI 3.63 to4.92). Primary care coverage showed an inverse association for both events (OR 0.10, 95{\%} CI 0.67 to 0.17; OR 0.18, 95{\%} CI 0.15 to 0.21) for pneumonia). Finally, a family that benefited from the Bolsa Fam{\'{i}}lia Programme had an inverse association for deaths from pneumonia (OR 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.52 to 1.25). CONCLUSIONS: The results do not just contribute to reduce mortality in children, but mainly contribute to prevent premature deaths through identification of critical areas in Brazil, which is crucial to qualify health surveillance services.},

abstract = {Thiopeptide antibiotics are emerging clinical candidates that exhibit potent antibacterial activity against a variety of intracellular pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Many thiopeptides directly inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting protein synthesis. However, recent work has shown that one thiopeptide, thiostrepton (TSR), can also induce autophagy in infected macrophages, which has the potential to be exploited for host-directed therapies against intracellular pathogens, such as Mtb. To better define the therapeutic potential of this class of antibiotics, we studied the host-directed effects of a suite of natural thiopeptides that spans five structurally diverse thiopeptide classes, as well as several analogs. We discovered that thiopeptides as a class induce selective autophagic removal of mitochondria, known as mitophagy. This activity is independent of other biological activities, such as proteasome inhibition or antibiotic activity. We also find that many thiopeptides exhibit potent activity against intracellular Mtb in macrophage infection models. However, the thiopeptide-induced mitophagy occurs outside of pathogen-containing autophagosomes and does not appear to contribute to thiopeptide control of intracellular Mtb. These results expand basic understanding of thiopeptide biology and provide key guidance for the development of new thiopeptide antibiotics and host-directed therapeutics.},

abstract = {Immunity to tuberculosis (TB) is suppressed due to HIV coinfection and this suppression could further be enhanced by pregnancy. However, the effect of pregnancy on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis)-specific immune response during HIV/latent TB co-infection is not well understood. Here we investigated the changes in M. tuberculosis-specific functional Th1, Th2 and antibody responses in pregnant women with HIV/latent TB co-Infection. Pregnancy, concurrent with HIV infection, triggers a substantial suppression of M. tuberculosis-specific IFN-$\gamma$ responses in a CD4(+) T cell count dependent manner with an insignificant change in IL-4 and IgG responses. Conversely, M. tuberculosis-specific IL-10 production was markedly augmented in latent TB infected pregnant women with a lesser extent during HIV co-infection. These findings reveal that pregnancy suppresses anti-mycobacterial protective immune response in a CD4(+) T cell count dependent manner during HIV/latent TB co-infection, suggesting a higher risk of developing active TB during pregnancy as a result of failing to control TB infection.},

abstract = {Biogenesis of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in an essential process in living organisms due to the critical role of Fe-S cluster proteins in myriad cell functions. During biogenesis of Fe-S clusters, multi-protein complexes are used to drive the mobilization and protection of reactive sulfur and iron intermediates, regulate assembly of various Fe-S clusters on an ATPase-dependent, multi-protein scaffold, and target nascent clusters to their downstream protein targets. The evolutionarily ancient sulfur formation (Suf) pathway for Fe-S cluster assembly is found in bacteria and archaea. In Escherichia coli, the Suf pathway functions as an emergency pathway under conditions of iron limitation or oxidative stress. In other pathogenic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Enterococcus faecalis, the Suf pathway is the sole source for Fe-S clusters and therefore is a potential target for the development of novel antibacterial compounds. Here we summarize the considerable progress that has been made in characterizing the first step of mobilization and protection of reactive sulfur carried out by the SufS-SufE or SufS-SufU complex, Fe-S cluster assembly on SufBC(2)D scaffold complexes, and the downstream trafficking of nascent Fe-S clusters to A-type carrier (ATC) proteins.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isolated posterior spinal (element) tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon compared to classical anterior spinal or para-discal TB. Here, we report magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of posterior spinal TB in 19 patients without involvement of the vertebral body and intervertebral disc. PURPOSE: To evaluate the MRI findings in isolated posterior spinal (element) TB. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Clinical and MRI data of 19 patients of isolated posterior spinal TB were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, group A comprised 4 (21{\%}) patients with rapid onset lower limb weakness and pyramidal signs while group B comprised 15 (79{\%}) patients without any neurological deficit. Lumbar vertebrae commonly affected 9 (47.4{\%}) patients followed by dorsal vertebrae in 8 (42.1{\%}) patients and cervical vertebrae in 2 (10.5{\%}) patients. The pedicle was most commonly involved in 12 (63.2{\%}) patients followed by the lamina in 11 (58{\%}) patients, and spinous process and facet joint in 6 (31.6{\%}) patients each. Extra-spinal inflammation/pyomyositis/paraspinal abscess was found in 13 (68.4{\%}) patients followed by epidural abscess 3 (15.8{\%}) patients and both extra spinal inflammation and epidural abscess in 3 (15.8{\%}) patients (15.8{\%}). Compressive cord myelopathy was observed in 4 (21{\%}) patients, where three patients underwent emergency decompression laminectomy and the remaining 16 patients were treated conservatively with anti-tubercular therapy. CONCLUSION: Initial diagnosis of isolated posterior element TB is challenging and requires a high index of suspicion. Early diagnosis of isolated posterior spinal TB is important as early treatment may be beneficial and decreases patient morbidity.},

abstract = {Patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) have received community-based care in Eswatini since 2009. Trained and compensated community treatment supporters (CTSs) provide directly observed therapy (DOT), injectables and psychological support. We examined the acceptability of this model of care among DR-TB patients, including the perspective of family members of DR-TB patients and their CTSs in relation to the patient's experience of care and quality of life. This qualitative research was conducted in rural Eswatini in February 2018. DR-TB patients, CTSs and family members participated in in-depth interviews, paired interviews, focus group discussions and PhotoVoice. Data were thematically analysed and coded, and themes were extracted. Methodological triangulation enhanced the interpretation. All patients and CTSs and most family members considered community-based DR-TB care to be supportive. Positive aspects were emotional support, trust and dedicated individual care, including enabling practical, financial and social factors. Concerns were related to social and economic problems within the family and fears about infection risks for the family and the CTSs. Community-based DR-TB care was acceptable to patients, family members and CTSs. To reduce family members' fears of TB infection, information and sensitisation within the family and constant follow-up appear crucial.},

We evaluated the accuracy of Akonni Biosystems XDR-TB TruArray{\textregistered} and Lateral Flow Cell (XDR-LFC), a novel multiplex assay to simultaneously detect mutations across seven genes that confer resistance to both first and second-line anti-TB drugs. The XDR-LFC includes 271 discrete three-dimensional gel elements with target-specific probes for identifying mutations in katG, inhA promoter, and ahpC promoter (isoniazid); rpoB (rifampin); gyrA (fluoroquinolones); rrs and eis promoter (kanamycin) and; rrs (capreomycin and amikacin). We evaluated XDR-LFC performance with 87 phenotypically and genotypically characterized clinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates. Overall assay accuracy for mutation detection in specific genes was 98.6{\%} for eis promoter and 100.0{\%} for the genes katG, inhA promoter, ahpC promoter, rpoB, gyrA, and rrs The sensitivity and specificity against phenotypic reference was 100{\%} and 100{\%} for isoniazid, 98.4{\%} and 50{\%} for rifampin (specificity increased to 100{\%} once the strains with documented "low-level resistance mutations" in rpoB were excluded), 96.2{\%} and 100{\%} for fluoroquinolones, 92.6{\%} and 100{\%} for kanamycin, 93.9{\%} and 97.4{\%} for capreomycin and 80{\%} and 100{\%} for amikacin.

abstract = {Tuberculosis is highly infectious and has a high incidence worldwide. Therefore, effective treatment is essential for the disease. The immune function and inflammatory factors can reflect the therapeutic effect of pulmonary tuberculosis to some extent. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical effect of vitamin D supplementation on pulmonary tuberculosis patients and its influence on the expression of immune cells and inflammatory factors in patients. A total of 256 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who were admitted to our hospital were collected as research participants; 120 patients who were treated with conventional antituberculosis drugs were taken as a control group (CG) and 136 patients who were treated with vitamin D-assisted antituberculosis drugs were taken as the research group (RG). The levels of inflammatory factors (IL-6, MMP-9, IL-4, TNF-$\alpha$) and T lymphocyte subgroup of patients were measured in both groups before and after treatment. The efficacy was compared in both groups. The disappearance time of wheezing and cough in RG was shorter than that in CG (P{\textless}0.001). There was no difference in X-ray chest plain film, sputum examination results and efficacy of patients in both groups (P{\textgreater}0.05). After treatment, CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+) were upregulated in both groups (P{\textless}0.05), while CD3(+), CD4(+), CD4(+)/CD8(+) in RG were higher than those in CG (P{\textless}0.05). After treatment, inflammatory factors in both groups improved compared with those before treatment. Serum inflammatory factors in RG were significantly lower than those in CG (P{\textless}0.05). After treatment, surfactant protein in the two groups was lower than that before treatment, while that in RG was significantly lower than that in CG (P{\textless}0.05). After treatment, soluble selectins in both groups improved significantly. The level of soluble selectins in RG was slightly lower than that in CG. The incidence of adverse reactions in RG was lower than that in CG. The life quality scores of patients in RG were slightly higher than those in CG (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, vitamin D-assisted antituberculosis drugs can effectively improve the immune function and expression level of inflammatory factors in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and reduce adverse reactions.},

abstract = {RATIONALE {\&} OBJECTIVES: Maintenance dialysis patients are at an increased risk of active tuberculosis (TB). In 2012, British Columbia (BC), Canada began systematically screening maintenance dialysis patients for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and treating people with evidence of LTBI when appropriate. We examined LTBI treatment outcomes and compared treatment outcomes before and after rollout of the systematic screening program. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING {\&} PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 365 people in BC, Canada initiating at least 90 days of dialysis from January 1 (st), 2001 to May 31(st), 2017, and starting LTBI therapy: 290 people (79.5{\%}) in the recent cohort and 75 people (20.5{\%}) in the historic cohort. People starting LTBI therapy from January 1(st), 2012 onward were classified as the recent cohort, while people starting LTBI therapy prior to January 1(st), 2012 were classified as the historic cohort. EXPOSURE: Systematic LTBI screening and therapy. OUTCOMES: Proportion of people who experience grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) or any grade rash and end-of-treatment outcomes. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Outcomes were reported using descriptive statistics. Two-sample test of proportions using the chi-square distribution was used to test for statistical significance between recent and historic cohorts. RESULTS: Overall, 298 people (81.6{\%}) successfully completed LTBI therapy. The proportion of people experiencing a grade 3-4 AE or any grade rash was 21.1{\%}. Most AEs were related to gastrointestinal events, general malaise, or pruritus that resulted in regimen changes. Two people (0.5{\%}) were hospitalized for AEs related to LTBI therapy. No significant difference was found between recent and historic cohorts in all outcomes of interest. No grade 5 AEs (deaths) were attributed to LTBI therapy. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective data and generalizability outside low TB burden settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a high proportion of people on maintenance dialysis can complete LTBI therapy. The rate of grade 3-4 AEs was high and associated with frequent medication changes during therapy. LTBI therapy in maintenance dialysis may be safe, but requires close monitoring.},

abstract = {Cycloserine is a WHO group B drug for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data for cycloserine when dosed as terizidone are sparse. The aim of this analysis was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of cycloserine, administered as terizidone, and predict doses of terizidone attaining cycloserine exposures associated with efficacy. Plasma cycloserine was measured 2-6 weeks after treatment initiation in patients hospitalized for second-line tuberculosis treatment. Pre-treatment MICs of cycloserine were determined on clinical isolates. We enrolled 132 participants with rifampicin-resistant TB; 79 were HIV positive. Median pre-treatment MIC was 16 mg/L. A one-compartment disposition model with two clearance pathways, non-renal (0.35 L/h) and renal (0.43 L/h) described cycloserine pharmacokinetics well. Non-renal clearance and volume were allometrically scaled using fat-free mass. Smoking increased non-renal clearance by 41{\%}. Simulations showed that with daily doses of terizidone (750 mg and 1000 mg for patients weighing ≤ 45 kg and {\textgreater} 45 kg, respectively), the probability of maintaining plasma cycloserine above the MIC (T({\textgreater}MIC)) for more than 30{\%} of the dosing interval (which is associated with a 1.0 log(10) CFU/mL kill in vitro) exceeds, 90{\%} at MIC values ≤ 16 mg/L, but the proportion of patients achieving 100{\%} T({\textgreater}MIC) (which is associated with prevention of resistance) is more than 90{\%} only with MICs ≤ 8 mg/L. Based on a target derived in vitro, the WHO recommended doses of terizidone are effective for cycloserine MICs ≤ 8 mg/L and higher doses are required to prevent the development of resistance.},

abstract = {Bacterial natural products have inspired the development of numerous antibiotics in use today. As resistance to existing antibiotics has become more prevalent, new antibiotic lead structures and activities are desperately needed. An increasing number of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters, to which no known molecules can be assigned, are found in genome and metagenome sequencing data. Here we access structural information encoded in this underexploited resource using a synthetic-bioinformatic natural product (syn-BNP) approach, which relies on bioinformatic algorithms followed by chemical synthesis to predict and then produce small molecules inspired by biosynthetic gene clusters. In total, 157 syn-BNP cyclic peptides inspired by 96 nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters were synthesized and screened for antibacterial activity. This yielded nine antibiotics with activities against ESKAPE pathogens as well as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Not only are antibiotic-resistant pathogens susceptible to many of these syn-BNP antibiotics, but they were also unable to develop resistance to these antibiotics in laboratory experiments. Characterized modes of action for these antibiotics include cell lysis, membrane depolarization, inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis, and ClpP protease dysregulation. Increasingly refined syn-BNP-based explorations of biosynthetic gene clusters should allow for more rapid identification of evolutionarily inspired bioactive small molecules, in particular antibiotics with diverse mechanism of actions that could help confront the imminent crisis of antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {AIM: To study clinical profile of children with mediastinal tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken between January 2015 and March 2018 in children diagnosed with mediastinal TB. Clinical history, examination and radioimaging, such as chest X-ray and HRCT chest, were done in every patient at the start of therapy. The prevalence of mediastinal TB was calculated. Factors associated with mediastinal TB and associated pulmonary TB (PTB) were analysed. RESULTS: Out of total 1407 patients with TB, 58 (4.12{\%}) had mediastinal involvement. Fever was seen in 49 (84.5{\%}) patients, positive Mantoux test (MT) in 32 (68.1{\%}), cough in 28 (48.3{\%}), loss of appetite in 24 (41.4{\%}) and weight loss in 17 (29.3{\%}). Associated PTB was present in 22 (37.9{\%}) patients. Associated extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) was observed in 12 (20.7{\%}) patients. Fifty-one patients (87.9{\%}) had an abnormal X-ray. Baseline HRCT chest was done in 54 (93.1{\%}) patients and all of them showed necrotic caseous mediastinal nodes. Treatment duration of patients who completed treatment with first-line anti-tuberculous therapy was 11.67 months. Seventeen patients (29.3{\%}) were diagnosed to have drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Cough was seen more commonly in patients with associated PTB (68.2{\%}) as compared to isolated mediastinal TB (36.1{\%}) (p = 0.0296). CONCLUSION: Mediastinal TB is common in children with EPTB. Associated PTB is seen in only about one-third of the patients. X-ray chest is abnormal in half the patients; hence, HRCT chest may be required to make a diagnosis. Bacteriological confirmation is necessary due to high incidence of DR-TB in these patients. Most of the patients require treatment for a longer duration as resolution takes a longer time. Computed tomography imaging on follow-up helps to determine the treatment duration.},

abstract = {In 2019, the WHO tuberculosis (TB) treatment guidelines were updated to recommend only limited use of streptomycin, in favor of newer agents or amikacin as the preferred aminoglycoside for drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis However, the emergence of resistance to newer drugs, such as bedaquiline, has prompted a reanalysis of antitubercular drugs in search of untapped potential. Using 211 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis from South Africa, we performed phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) to aminoglycosides by both critical concentration and MIC determination in parallel with whole-genome sequencing to identify known genotypic resistance elements. Isolates with low-level streptomycin resistance mediated by gidB were frequently misclassified with respect to streptomycin resistance when using the WHO-recommended critical concentration of 2 $\mu$g/ml. We identified 29 M. tuberculosis isolates from South Africa with low-level streptomycin resistance concomitant with high-level amikacin resistance, conferred by gidB and rrs 1400, respectively. Using a large global data set of M. tuberculosis genomes, we observed 95 examples of this corresponding resistance genotype (gidB-rrs 1400), including identification in 81/257 (31.5{\%}) of extensively drug resistant (XDR) isolates. In a phylogenetic analysis, we observed repeated evolution of low-level streptomycin and high-level amikacin resistance in multiple countries. Our findings suggest that current critical concentration methods and the design of molecular diagnostics need to be revisited to provide more accurate assessments of streptomycin resistance for gidB-containing isolates. For patients harboring isolates of M. tuberculosis with high-level amikacin resistance conferred by rrs 1400, and for whom newer agents are not available, treatment with streptomycin may still prove useful, even in the face of low-level resistance conferred by gidB.},

CDG-Tre fluoresces upon activation by BlaC, the $\beta$-lactamase uniquely expressed by Mtb, and the fluorescent product is subsequently incorporated within the bacterial cell wall via trehalose metabolic pathway. CDG-Tre showed high selectivity for mycobacteria over other clinically prevalent species in the Corynebacterineae suborder. The unique labeling strategy of BCG by CDG-Tre provides a versatile tool for tracking Mtb in both pre- and post-phagocytosis and elucidating fundamental physiological and pathological processes related to the mycomembrane.},

abstract = {Despite having good efficacy in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis, the administration of rifampicin (RIF) can cause serious side effects, resulting from the prolonged use of this substance. Thus, it is necessary to seek new systems for administering tuberculostatic drugs, to avoid unwanted adverse effects, increase their bioavailability and, consequently, improve their therapeutic efficacy. The present work describes the achievement of a pH-responsive system for RIF, using palygorskite, a fibrous clay mineral, as a nanocarrier. To evaluate the influence of some operational variables on the drug adsorption process, a 2(4) factorial experimental design was used. The experiment using a maximum concentration (0.125 mg/mL), lower mass of PAL (300 mg), and lower pH (pH 2) was more efficient compared to other experiments, resulting in a higher dose of the incorporated drug, equivalent to 33.62 mg/g. To elucidate the mechanism of interaction between the materials, the hybrid obtained was characterized by different characterization techniques (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry/derived thermogravimetry, zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy, and dispersive energy spectroscopy). In addition, kinetic models and adsorption isotherms were applied to the experimental data. Through in vitro release studies, it was possible to verify the effectiveness of the pH-dependent system obtained. The adjustment of experimental release data to the theoretical model of Higuchi indicated that the release of rifampicin occurs in a prolonged way from the palygorskite.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies from Ethiopia detected disease clustering using broader geographic settings, but limited information exists on the spatial distribution of the disease using residential locations. An assessment of predictors of spatial variations of TB at community level could fill the knowledge gaps, and helps in devising tailored interventions to improve TB control. OBJECTIVE: To assess the pattern of spatial distribution of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) based on geographic locations of individual cases in the Dale district and Yirga Alem town in southern Ethiopia. METHODS: The socio-demographic characteristics of PTB cases were collected using a structured questionnaire, and spatial information was collected using geographic position systems. We carried out Getis and Ord (Gi*) statistics and scan statistics to explore the pattern of spatial clusters of PTB cases, and geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to assess the spatial heterogeneities in relationship between predictor variables and PTB case notification rates (CNRs). RESULTS: The distribution of PTB varied by enumeration areas within the kebeles, and we identified areas with significant hotspots in various areas ineach year. In GWR analysis, the disease distribution showed a geographic heterogeneity (non-stationarity) in relation to physical access (distance to TB control facilities) and population density (AICc = 5591, R(2) = 0.3359, adjusted R(2) = 0.2671). The model explained 27{\%} of the variability in PTB CNRs (local R(2) ranged from 0.0002-0.4248 between enumeration areas). The GWR analysis showed that areas with high PTB CNRs had better physical accessibility to TB control facilities and high population density. The effect of physical access on PTB CNRs changed after the coverage of TB control facilities was improved. CONCLUSION: We report a varying distribution of PTB in small and different areas over 10 years. Spatial and temporal analysis of disease distribution can be used to identify areas with a high burden of disease and predictors of clustering, which helps in making policy decisions and devising targeted interventions.},

PE{\_}PGRS proteins share a conserved structural architecture with three main domains: the N-terminal PE domain; the PGRS domain, that can vary in sequence and size and is characterized by the presence of multiple GGA-GGX amino acid repeats; the highly conserved sequence containing the GRPLI motif that links the PE and PGRS domains; the unique C-terminus end that can vary in size from few to up to ≈ 300 amino acids. pe{\_}pgrs genes emerged in slow-growing mycobacteria and expanded and diversified in MTBC and few other pathogenic mycobacteria. Interestingly, despite sequence homology and apparent redundancy, PE{\_}PGRS proteins seem to have evolved a peculiar function. In this review, we summarize the actual knowledge on this elusive protein family in terms of evolution, structure, and function, focusing on the role of PE{\_}PGRS in TB pathogenesis. We provide an original hypothesis on the role of the PE domain and propose a structural model for the polymorphic PGRS domain that might explain how so similar proteins can have different physiological functions.},

abstract = {The first report of the Ghon complex was by Anton Ghon (1866-1936), an Austrian pathologist who described primary tuberculosis to have the findings of a pulmonary lesion with regional lymph involvement caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primary pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infection on chest radiography commonly presents with either one of the following four presentations: parenchymal disease, lymphadenopathy, pleural effusions, miliary tuberculosis, and the possibility of any combination of these. Specifically, in parenchymal disease, primary TB is hallmarked with a pulmonary lesion (also known as a Ghon lesion or Ghon focus) and affected draining lymph node adenopathy forming the Ghon's complex. The Ghon complex is a non-pathognomonic radiographic finding on a chest x-ray that is significant for pulmonary infection of tuberculosis. The location of the Ghon's focus is usually subpleural and predominantly in the upper part of the lower lobe and lower part of the middle or upper lobe. The predilection to this area is because the ventilation is best in this region, and the most frequently encountered route of infection is through the respiratory tract. Radiographic findings of the Ghon focus may include parenchymal scarring of the lung tissue, lesion cavitation, or lobar consolidation, as seen in Figures 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3. The Ghon complex should not be confused with the Ranke complex. The Ghon complex precedes the development of a Ranke complex, in that a Ghon complex is seen in untreated primary pulmonary tuberculosis infection with Ghon lesion fibrosis while the Ranke complex is a result of the healing of a primary tuberculosis Ghon complex characterized by a calcified Ghon lesion and calcified mediastinal lymph nodes.},

The loading performance of anti-tuberculosis drugs with starch nanocrystals and native starch was found in the range of 65-95{\%}. According to the release study, the native starch was not appropriate, however, the starch nanocrystals demonstrated sustained release drug delivery for isoniazid and pyrazinamide ranging from 50 to 93{\%} for 24 h; the burst release for streptomycin was reported at pH 2 in 6.5 h while only 14{\%} rifampicin was released at pH 8 buffer. An anti-mycobacterium analysis of strain H37Rv showed that minimum inhibition concentration of starch nanocrystals loaded with isoniazid and pyrazinamide (0.033 $\mu$g/mL and 1.25 $\mu$g/mL, respectively) were more effective than the parent isoniazid (0.2 $\mu$g/mL) and pyrazinamide (25.0 $\mu$g/mL) at pH 5.5.},

abstract = {Among the various strategies of curbing tuberculosis, suppression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a primary goal of the WHO to stop its infection, which is further strengthened by the presence of a massive reservoir of latently infected individuals. Several efforts have been made to explore potential candidates, including drug-repurposing, phytomolecules evaluation, and de novo designs. Compared to other strategies, investigation of phytomolecules with known experimental evidence represents a highly cost-effective and less time-consuming approach. Interestingly, some of the phytomolecules, previously known to show anti-tuberculosis effects, are known. While, these compounds have not yet been tested for their additional abilities to interact with resuscitation-promoting factor B (RpfB), an essential protein involved in revoking of Mtb dormancy. We, therefore, performed an initial computational study to evaluate the binding affinity of 38 phytomolecules to select the most effective ligands against RpfB. The studies were carried out using AutoDock and associated tools for static interaction analysis, while molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the stability of predicted protein-ligand complexes using the Desmond MD package. As an outcome of this study, we have reported four potential compounds, viz. diospyrin, 2'-Nortiliacorinine, 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone, and tiliacorine which showed a putative binding affinity with significant intermolecular interactions, docking energy of -8.0 kcal/mol or higher, and vital complex stability ({\~{}}2.4 {\AA} RMSD) during 100 ns MD simulation. The findings of this study indicated that phytomolecules are capable to efficiently inhibit the RpfB, which is vital for reactivation of dormant Mtb. Characterization of the molecular targets for hits with intriguingly selective activity against dormant Mtb would be helpful to elucidate the essential mechanisms underlying the survival of dormant Mtb during latent infections.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) kills more people than any other infectious disease. Challenges for developing better treatments include the complex pathology due to within-host immune dynamics, interpatient variability in disease severity and drug pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD), and the growing emergence of resistance. Model-informed drug development using quantitative and translational pharmacology has become increasingly recognized as a method capable of drug prioritization and regimen optimization to efficiently progress compounds through TB drug development phases. In this review, we examine translational models and tools, including plasma PK scaling, site-of-disease lesion PK, host-immune and bacteria interplay, combination PK-PD models of multidrug regimens, resistance formation, and integration of data across nonclinical and clinical phases. We propose a workflow that integrates these tools with computational platforms to identify drug combinations that have the potential to accelerate sterilization, reduce relapse rates, and limit the emergence of resistance. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Volume 61 is January 8, 2021.

The emergence of drug-resistant M.tb strains stresses the need for drugs acting on new targets. Mycolic acids are very long chain fatty acids playing an essential role in the architecture and permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall. Their biosynthesis involves two fatty acid synthase (FAS) systems. Among the four enzymes (MabA, HadAB/BC, InhA and KasA/B) of the FAS-II cycle, MabA (FabG1) remains the only one for which specific inhibitors have not been reported yet. The development of a new LC-MS/MS based enzymatic assay allowed the screening of a 1280 fragment-library and led to the discovery of the first small molecules that inhibit MabA activity. A fragment from the anthranilic acid series was optimized into more potent inhibitors and their binding to MabA was confirmed by (19)F ligand-observed NMR experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) has the potential to improve access to healthcare, especially in developing countries. The proliferation of mHealth has not been accompanied by a corresponding growth in design guidelines for mHealth applications. This paper proposes a framework for mHealth application design that combines the Information Systems Research (ISR) framework and design thinking. We demonstrate a use case for the proposed framework in the form of an app to read the result of the tuberculin skin test (TST), which is used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection. The framework was used in the re-design of the TST reading app but could also be used in earlier stages of mHealth app design. METHODS: The ISR framework and design thinking were merged based on how the modes of design thinking integrate with the cycles of the ISR framework. Using the combined framework, we re-designed an mHealth app for TST reading, intended to be used primarily in a developing context by healthcare workers. Using the proposed framework, the app was iterated upon and developed with the aid of personas, observations, prototyping and questionnaires. RESULT: The combined framework was applied through engagement with end-users, namely ten healthcare workers and ten graduate students. Through review of the literature and iterations of the app prototype, we identified various usability requirements and limitations. These included challenges related to image capture and a misunderstanding of instructions. These insights influenced the development and improvement of the app. CONCLUSION: The combined framework allowed for engagement with end-users and for low-cost, rapid development of the app while addressing contextual challenges and needs. The integration of design thinking modes with the ISR cycles was effective in achieving the objectives of each approach. The combined framework acknowledges the importance of engaging users when implementing mHealth technologies, especially in developing and under-resourced contexts. Findings from this study support the use of this framework as a guide in the design of user-centred mHealth interventions.},

abstract = {Lung ultrasound (LUS) is highly portable and has excellent diagnostic accuracy for pneumonia compared with conventional radiography, but the literature on its use in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is limited. This study characterized lesions using LUS in patients with PTB and compared them with chest X-ray (CXR). Adult patients in Lima, Peru, with PTB were recruited within 1 week of starting antituberculosis treatment. Comprehensive LUS was performed in all patients at enrollment and assessed for consolidation, small subpleural consolidation (SPC, hypothesized to be a marker of CXR consolidation), cavity, pleural effusion, pathologic B-lines, and miliary pattern. Patient CXRs were digitized and interpreted by a board-certified radiologist. Fifty-one patients were included in the final analysis. Lung ultrasound detected either consolidation or SPC in 96.1{\%} of participants. No significant difference was found between the LUS detection of a composite of consolidation or SPC, and CXR detection of consolidation (96.1{\%} versus 98{\%}, P = 1.00). The proportion of patients with cavity detected by LUS was significantly lower than that detected by CXR (5.9{\%} versus 51{\%}, P {\textless} 0.001). Overall, LUS detection of consolidation or SPC may be a sensitive marker for diagnosis of PTB. Lung ultrasound demonstrated poor ability to detect radiographically identified cavity, although previous studies suggest SPC could add specificity for the diagnosis of PTB. Based on its portability and evidence base for diagnosing other pulmonary diseases, LUS may have a role in screening and diagnosis of PTB in areas without ready access to CXR. Further studies should evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in patients with and without PTB.},

abstract = {Modulation of immunity and disease by glycans is increasingly recognized. However, how host glycosylation shapes and is shaped by tuberculosis remains poorly understood. We show that deficiency in the glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 1 (Gcnt1), a key enzyme for core-2 O-glycans biosynthesis, drives susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The increased susceptibility of Gcnt1 deficient mice was characterized by extensive lung immune pathology, mechanistically related to neutrophils. Uninfected Gcnt1 deficient mice presented bone marrow, blood and lung neutrophilia, which further increased with infection. Blood neutrophilia required Gcnt1 deficiency in the hematopoietic compartment, relating with enhanced granulopoiesis, but normal cellular egress from the bone marrow. Interestingly, for the blood neutrophilia to translate into susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection, Gnct1 deficiency in the stroma was also necessary. Complete Gcnt1 deficiency associated with increased lung expression of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL2. Lastly, we demonstrate that the transcript levels of various glycosyltransferase-encoding genes were altered in whole blood of active tuberculosis patients and that sialyl Lewis x, a glycan widely present in human neutrophils, was detected in the lung of tuberculosis patients. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between Gcnt1, neutrophilia and susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection, uncovering new players balancing the immune response in tuberculosis.},

The model incorporated human immune response, granuloma lesions, multi-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy, and bacterial resistance. A dynamic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulation model including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was developed and parameters aligned with previous experimental data. Population therapy outcomes for simulations were found to be generally consistent with summary results from previous clinical trials, for a range of drug dose and duration scenarios. An online tool developed from this model is released as open source software. The TB simulation tool could support analysis of new therapy options, novel drug types, and combinations, incorporating factors such as patient adherence behavior.},

abstract = {Despite the overwhelming success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, there remain numerous globally devastating diseases without fully protective vaccines, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis. Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis survives inside the macrophages by employing several host immune evasion strategies. Here, we reported a novel mechanism in which M. tuberculosis acetyltransferase, encoded by Rv3034c, induces peroxisome homeostasis to regulate host oxidative stress levels to facilitate intracellular mycobacterial infection. Presence of M. tuberculosis Rv3034c induces the expression of peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation factors such as Pex3, Pex5, Pex19, Pex11b, Fis-1 and DLP-1; while depletion of Rv3034c decreased the expression of these molecules, thereby selective degradation of peroxisomes via pexophagy. Further studies revealed that M. tuberculosis Rv3034c inhibit induction of pexophagy mechanism by down-regulating the expression of pexophagy associated proteins (p-AMPK$\alpha$, p-ULK-1, Atg5, Atg7, Beclin-1, LC3-II, TFEB and Keap-1) and adaptor molecules (NBR1 and p62). Inhibition was found to be dependent on the phosphorylation of mTORC1 and activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-$\gamma$. In order to maintain intracellular homeostasis during oxidative stress, M. tuberculosis Rv3034c was found to induce degradation of dysfunctional and damaged peroxisomes through activation of Pex14 in infected macrophages. In conclusion, this is the first report which demonstrated that M. tuberculosis acetyltransferase regulate peroxisome homeostasis in response to intracellular redox levels to favour mycobacterial infection in macrophage.},

abstract = {The diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is often challenging due to paucibacillary nature of the disease. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) has been developed to improve detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) in paucibacillary specimens. The objective of the study was to assess the performance of Ultra for the diagnosis of EPTB in a high-income low TB prevalence country. Extrapulmonary samples received for TB diagnostics at two hospitals in Norway between January 2015 and January 2016 were prospectively and consecutively included. Defrosted samples were subjected to Ultra. Culture and routine PCR tests were used as reference standard. A total of 82 samples, 10 culture and/or routine PCR positive (confirmed TB) samples and 72 culture and routine PCR negative samples were included in analysis. The overall sensitivity and specificity of Ultra were 90{\%} (9/10, 95{\%} CI 56-100) and 99{\%} (71/72, 95{\%} CI 93-100), respectively. Ultra was positive in 6/7 smear negative confirmed TB samples. To conclude, Ultra showed a high sensitivity and specificity in extrapulmonary specimens and may contribute to a rapid diagnosis of EPTB in a low TB prevalence setting.},

abstract = {The lung microbiome plays an important role in the pathophysiological processes associated with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). However, only a few studies using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing have been reported, and the interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and the lung microbiome remain poorly understood. Patients with respiratory symptoms and imaging abnormalities compatible with tuberculosis (TB) were enrolled. We analyzed the lung microbiome in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 30 MTB-positive (MTB+) subjects and 30 MTB negative (MTB-) subjects by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Alpha diversity tended to be lower in the MTB+ group than in the MTB- group. There was a significant difference in beta diversity between the MTB+ and MTB- subjects. MTB+ lung samples were dominated by MTB, while MTB- samples were enriched with Streptococcus, Prevotella, Nesseria, Selenomonas and Bifidobacterium, which more closely resemble the microbial composition of a healthy lung. Network analysis suggested that MTB could greatly impact the microbial community structure. MTB+ and MTB- communities showed distinct functional signatures. Fungal communities were also found to be associated with the presence or absence of MTB. Furthermore, it was confirmed that 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing underrepresents Mycobacterium. This pilot study is the first to explore the interplay between MTB and the host microbiome by using metagenomic sequencing. MTB dominates the lung microbiome of MTB+ subjects, while MTB- subjects have a Streptococcus-enriched microbiome. The 16S approach underrepresents Mycobacterium and is not the best way to study the TB-associated microbiome.},

abstract = {Criteria defining bedaquiline resistance for tuberculosis have been proposed addressing an emerging concern. We evaluated bedaquiline phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) criteria using drug-resistant tuberculosis clinical isolates tested at five reference laboratories. Isolates were tested at the proposed bedaquiline MGIT960 and 7H11 agar proportion (AP) critical concentrations and also at higher dilutions. The epidemiological cutoff value for the broth microdilution (BMD) plates (frozen and dry) was investigated. Sanger sequencing was performed (atpE and Rv0678 genes) for any isolate testing resistant. The composite reference standard (CRS) defined susceptibility or resistance as is if all pDST methods agreed. If the pDST result was discordant, sequencing results were used for final classification. Geographically diverse and bedaquiline-unexposed isolates were tested (n = 495). The epidemiological cutoff value for BMD was confirmed to be 0.12 $\mu$g/ml. The majority of isolates were determined to be susceptible by all methods (467/495; 94.3{\%}), and 28 were determined to be resistant by at least one method; 4 of these were determined to be resistant by all methods. Of the 28 resistant isolates, 12 harbored Rv0678 mutations exclusively. Isolates with insertions/deletions were more likely to be determined to be resistant by more than one method (5/7) compared to isolates with a single nucleotide polymorphism (1/5). Applying the CRS to 24 discordant pDST, BMD dry correctly detected most (15/24; 63{\%}), followed by MGIT960 and BMD frozen (13/24; 61{\%}) and lastly AP (12/24; 50{\%}). Applying the CRS, the prevalence of bedaquiline resistance was 2.2{\%} and ranged from 1.4 to 3.4{\%}, depending on the method used. All methods performed well for bedaquiline susceptibility determination; however, resistance detected should be investigated by a second, alternative method.},

Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a potential Achilles heel of the pathogen. Based on a previously reported MtbTMPK 6-aryl-substituted pyridone inhibitor and guided by two co-crystal structures of MtbTMPK with pyridone- and thymine-based inhibitors, we report the synthesis of a series of aryl-shifted cyanopyridone analogues. These compounds generally lacked significant MtbTMPK inhibitory potency, but some analogues did exhibit promising antitubercular activity. Analogue 11i demonstrated a 10-fold increased antitubercular activity (MIC H37Rv, 1.2 $\mu$M) compared to literature compound 5. Many analogues with whole-cell antimycobacterial activity were devoid of significant cytotoxicity.},

abstract = {Several vaccines elicit lower efficacy or impaired immune responses in rural compared to urban settings, and in tropical low-income countries compared to high-income countries. An unresolved hypothesis is that immunomodulation by parasitic infections such as helminths (prevalent in rural tropical settings) contributes to suppression of vaccine responses. Among 1-17-year-old Ugandan residents of rural Schistosoma mansoni (Sm)-endemic islands and proximate urban communities with lower helminth exposure, we assessed plasma antibody and whole blood assay cytokine responses to tetanus toxoid (TT) and purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). These were taken to represent recall responses to tetanus and BCG vaccination in infancy. PPD-specific responses are additionally induced by tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial exposure. Urban-rural comparisons showed that PPD-specific IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-13 and TT-specific IL-13 and IgG concentrations were lower in the rural setting, but that PPD-specific IgE concentrations were higher. Among rural participants, Sm infection was inversely associated with PPD-specific IFN-$\gamma$, while nematode infection was positively associated with PPD-specific IgG. Among urban participants, Sm infection was positively associated with PPD-specific responses but inversely associated with TT-specific responses, while nematode infection was inversely associated with TT-specific IgG and IgG4, but no associations were observed with PPD-specific responses. Despite these associations, for the urban-rural comparisons there were no notable changes in test statistics after adjusting for current helminth infections, suggesting that helminths were not the sole explanation for the urban-rural differences observed. Helminths likely work in concert with other environmental exposures and operational factors to influence vaccine response.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious global public health problem in the present. TB also affects other sites (extrapulmonary tuberculosis, EPTB), and accounts for a significant proportion of tuberculosis cases worldwide. In order to comprehensively understand epidemiology of EBTB in China, and improve early diagnosis and treatment, we conducted a large-scale multi-center observational study to assess the demographic data and the prevalence of common EPTB inpatients, and further evaluate the prevalence of EPTB concurrent with Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and the associations between multiple EPTB types and gender-age group in China. All consecutive age≥15yr inpatients with a confirmed diagnosis of EPTB during the period from January 2011 to December 2017 were included in the study. The descriptive statistical analysis included median and quartile measurements for continuous variables, and frequencies and proportions with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for categorical variables. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to compare the association of multiple EPTB types between age group and gender. The results showed that the proportion of 15-24 years and 25-34 years in EPTB inpatients were the most and the ratio of male: female was 1.51. Approximately 70{\%} of EPTB inpatients were concurrent with PTB or other types of EPTB. The most common of EPTB was tuberculous pleurisy (50.15{\%}), followed by bronchial tuberculosis (14.96{\%}), tuberculous lymphadenitis of the neck (7.24{\%}), tuberculous meningitis (7.23{\%}), etc. It was found that many EPTB inpatients concurrent with PTB. The highest prevalence of EPTB concurrent with PTB was pharyngeal/laryngeal tuberculosis (91.31{\%}), followed by bronchial tuberculosis (89.52{\%}), tuberculosis of hilar lymph nodes (79.52{\%}), tuberculosis of mediastinal lymph nodes (79.13{\%}), intestinal tuberculosis (72.04{\%}), tuberculous pleurisy (65.31{\%}) and tuberculous meningitis (62.64{\%}), etc. The results from EPTB concurrent with PTB suggested that females EPTB inpatients were less likely to be at higher risk of concurrent PTB (aOR = 0.819, 95{\%}CI:0.803-0.835) after adjusted by age. As age increasing, the trend risk of concurrent PTB decreased (aOR = 0.994, 95{\%}CI: 0.989-0.999) after adjusted by gender. Our study demonstrated that the common EPTB were tuberculous pleurisy, bronchial tuberculosis, tuberculous lymphadenitis of the neck, tuberculous meningitis, etc. A majority of patients with pharyngeal/laryngeal tuberculosis, bronchial tuberculosis, tuberculosis of hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes, intestinal tuberculosis, tuberculous pleurisy, tuberculous meningitis, etc. were concurrent with PTB. Female EPTB inpatients were less likely to be at higher risk of concurrent PTB, and as age increasing, the trend risk of concurrent PTB decreased. The clinicians should be alert to the presence of concurrent tuberculosis in EPTB, and all suspected cases of EPTB should be assessed for concomitant PTB to determine whether the case is infectious and to help for early diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the effectiveness of IGRA-based isoniazid (INH) treatment with the diagnostic value of quantitative IGRA titer for post-transplant tuberculosis (TB) in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. METHODS: All adult KT recipients were enrolled from January 2014 to December 2017. The development of TB after KT was observed, stratified by quantitative IGRA results as well as by IGRA results with/without INH treatment. RESULTS: Of 1150 KT recipients, 322 (28{\%}) revealed positive IGRA results (≥0.35 IU/mL) and 12 (1.0{\%}) developed TB. Seven (3.2{\%}) of 217 patients with positive IGRA without INH developed TB, whereas none of 105 patients with positive IGRA with INH developed TB (rate difference -1616 per 100,000 person-years, P = 0.016) and 5 (0.6{\%}) of 828 patients with negative or indeterminate IGRA developed TB (rate difference -1388 per 100,000 person-years, P{\textless}0.001). Among the 217 positive IGRA patients without INH, 6 (6.4{\%}) of 94 patients who had positive IGRA titer{\textgreater}2.96 IU/mL developed TB, whereas one (0.8{\%}) of 123 patients who had positive IGRA titer≤2.96 IU/mL developed TB (rate difference 2964 per 100,000 person-years, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: IGRA-based INH treatment with risk stratification by quantitative IGRA results appears to be effective to prevent the development of TB in KT recipients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D (Vit. D) is used extensively during tuberculosis treatment. Low levels of serum Vit. D increase the risk of active tuberculosis development. Altered expression of the proteins involved in Vit. D metabolism impairs cathelicidin production, thereby increasing the host susceptibility to tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: We are trying to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRP2, CUBN, and VDR genes could affect tuberculosis development. METHODS: We included participants of the Korean Association Resource (KARE), part of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), and used their recorded data. A total of 8840 people (4182 men and 4658 women) were eligible subjects. The 5-kb regions from the ends of transcripts of GC, LRP2, CUBN, and VDR genes were amplified to select 13, 47, 70, and 15 SNPs, respectively. For association analysis and statistical analysis, PLINK version 1.07 and PASW Statistics version 18.0 were used. RESULTS: Significant correlation was observed in 11, 2, and 1 SNPs in LRP2, CUBN, and VDR genes. The effect of rs6747692 of LRP2 on transcription factor binding was confirmed using RegulomeDB. We confirmed that rs2239182 of VDR is located in the genomic eQTL region and can affect transcription factor binding and gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in Vit. D metabolism influence immune system components. Therefore, such polymorphisms may influence the susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis invasion and alter the defense mechanisms against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The correlation between genetic variation and tuberculosis development can provide new guidelines for the management of tuberculosis.},

abstract = {The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) is able to boost innate immune responses through a process called 'trained immunity'. It is hypothesized that BCG-induced trained immunity contributes to protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Since alveolar macrophages are the first cell type to encounter M. tuberculosis upon infection, we aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of BCG vaccination on alveolar macrophages. Searching for a less-invasive method than bronchoalveolar lavage, we optimized the isolation of alveolar macrophages from induced sputum of healthy volunteers. Viable alveolar macrophages could be successfully isolated from induced sputum and showed signs of activation already upon retrieval. Further flow cytometric analyses revealed that at baseline, higher expression levels of activation markers were observed on the alveolar macrophages of smokers compared to non-smokers. In addition, BCG vaccination resulted in decreased expression of the activation markers CD11b and HLA-DR on alveolar macrophages. Future studies should evaluate the functional consequences of this reduced activation of alveolar macrophages after BCG vaccination.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis (Mbov) is the primary cause of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and also infecting a wide range of domestic animal and wildlife species and humans. In Germany, bTB still emerges sporadically in cattle herds, free-ranging wildlife, diverse captive animal species, and humans. In order to understand the underlying population structure and estimate the population size fluctuation through time, we analyzed 131 Mbov strains from animals (n = 38) and humans (n = 93) in Germany from 1999 to 2017 by whole genome sequencing (WGS), MIRU-VNTR typing, and spoligotyping. Based on WGS data analysis, 122 out of the 131 Mbov strains were classified into 13 major clades, six contained strains from both human and animal cases, and seven only from human cases. Bayesian analyses suggest that the Mbov population went through two sharp anticlimaxes, one in the middle of the 18(th) century and another one in the 1950's. WGS based cluster analysis grouped 46 strains into 13 clusters ranging in size from 2-11 members and involving strains from distinct host types, e.g. only cattle, and also mixed hosts. Animal strains of four clusters were obtained over a nine-year time span, pointing towards autochthonous persistent bTB infection cycles. As expected, WGS had a higher discriminatory power than spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing. In conclusion, our data confirm that WGS and suitable bioinformatics is the method of choice to implement a prospective molecular epidemiological surveillance of Mbov. The population of Mbov in Germany is diverse, with subtle, but existing interactions between different host groups.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major transition in tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology is taking place in many European countries including Finland. Monitoring treatment outcome of TB cases is important for identifying gaps in the national TB control program, in order to strengthen the system. The aim of the study was to identify potential risk factors for non-successful TB treatment outcomes, with a particular focus on the impact of comorbidities. We also evaluated the treatment outcome monitoring system. METHODS: All notified microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB cases in Finland in 2007-2014 were included, except multi-drug resistant (MDR) cases. Nationwide register data were retrieved from: Infectious Diseases Register, Population Register, Cause of Death Register and Hospital Discharge Register. Non-successful outcomes were divided into three groups: death, unsatisfactory outcomes and non-defined outcomes. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for non-successful outcomes. RESULTS: Treatment outcomes were notified for 98.6{\%} of study cases (n = 1396/1416). Treatment success rate was 75{\%}. The main reason for non-successful outcome was death (16{\%}), whereas outcomes failed and lost to follow-up were rare (1{\%} together). In a multivariable model, risk factors for death as outcome were increasing age, male gender and Charlson comorbidity index ≥1, for unsatisfactory outcomes non-MDR drug resistance and TB registered in the first study period, and for non-defined outcomes non-MDR drug resistance. Among 50 cases with unsatisfactory outcomes, we observed false outcome allocations in eight (16{\%}), and {\textgreater} 2{\%} of the cases transferred to another country or disappeared before or during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: With a high proportion of older population among tuberculosis cases, death is a common treatment outcome in Finland. Comorbidity is an important factor to be incorporated when interpreting and comparing outcome rates. There was a considerable inconsistency in outcome allocation in the monitoring system, which implies that there is need to review the guidelines and provide further training for outcome assessment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tissue damage leading to obstructive lung disease (OLD) could result from intravenous administration of insoluble particles found in illicit drugs. This study described the prevalence and identified correlates of OLD among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: In 2012-2016, a community-based cohort of PWID who had injected within the past month were enrolled in a study to assess HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and their related risk factors. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews, serological testing and spirometry. Baseline data were used for a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and correlates of OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC {\textless} 0.7. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with OLD. RESULTS: Among 516 participants who had complete spirometry and interview results, the mean age was 43.3 years, 73.6 {\%} were male, 9.5 {\%} were Black, 91.1 {\%} smoked cigarettes and 18.2 {\%} had OLD. Few (9.6 {\%}) PWID with OLD reported a previous diagnosis of COPD although many (44.7 {\%}) reported related symptoms. Black race (AOR = 2.66, 95 {\%}CI: 1.37, 5.17), pack-years smoked (AOR = 1.06/5 years, 95 {\%}CI: 1.01, 1.12), and duration of injection drug use (AOR = 1.13, 95 {\%}CI: 1.01, 1.27) were independently associated with OLD after controlling for age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of OLD was high in this cohort and associated with Black race and cigarette smoking-known risk factors. In addition, OLD prevalence increased with greater duration of injection drug use, suggesting a link between cumulative exposure to injected insoluble particles and OLD. Further examination of these adulterants and lung pathology are needed.},

abstract = {All mRNAs cannot be translated into full-length proteins due to ribosome-stalling that leads to release of peptidyl-tRNA which can be lethal for bacterial survival. The enzyme peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (PtH) hydrolyses the ester bond between nascent peptide and tRNA of peptidyl-tRNA and rescues the cells from toxicity. PtH is an essential enzyme in bacteria and inhibiting this crucial enzyme can serve to combat bacterial diseases. But due to lack of understanding about the catalytic mechanism of PtH, its inhibitors have not been developed. In this work, we have carried out the binding studies of M. tuberculosis and E. coli PtH with the peptidyl-tRNA analogue (puromycin) using ITC, FTIR, CD experiments followed by docking and MD simulations to identify the potential active site residues that would help to design PtH inhibitors. Binding studies of puromycin with both PtH by ITC experiments demonstrate similar thermodynamic parameters and three fold difference in their K(D). CD and FTIR studies detected changes in secondary structure composition of PtH in the presence of puromycin with different degree of perturbation. Though interactions with puromycin are conserved in both proteins, modelling studies revealed that water mediated interactions in M. tb-PtH resulting in higher affinity to puromycin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helminths and tuberculosis (TB) largely overlap at the population level. Whether helminth infections influence disease severity and bacterial burdens in TB is not well understood. METHODS: This study was conducted to examine the disease severity in a cohort of pulmonary TB (PTB) individuals with (Ss+) or without (Ss-) seropositivity for Strongyloides stercoralis infection. RESULTS: Ss+ was associated with increased risk of cavitation (odds ratio [OR], 4.54; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 2.33-9.04; P {\textless} .0001) and bilateral lung involvement (OR, 5.97; 95{\%} CI, 3.03-12.09; P {\textless} .0001) in PTB individuals. Ss+ was also associated with higher bacterial burdens (OR, 7.57; 95{\%} CI, 4.18-14.05; P {\textless} .0001) in PTB individuals. After multivariate analysis adjusting for covariates, Ss+ was still associated with greater risk of cavitation (adjusted OR [aOR], 3.99; 95{\%} CI, 1.73-9.19; P = .0014), bilateral lung involvement (aOR, 4.09; 95{\%} CI, 1.78-9.41; P = .0011), and higher bacterial burden (aOR, 9.32; 95{\%} CI, 6.30-13.96; P {\textless} .0001). Finally, Ss+ was also associated with higher plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinases ([MMP]-1, -2, -7, -8, and -9) in PTB individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our data demonstrate that coexistent Ss infection is associated with greater disease severity and higher bacterial burden in PTB. Our data also demonstrate enhanced plasma levels of MMPs in coinfected individuals, suggesting a plausible biological mechanism for these effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) are major concerns for TB control. We evaluated characteristics of patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB who received a delayed diagnosis and identified risk factors that may have contributed to this delay. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of patients with smear-negative culture-positive pulmonary TB treated at a tertiary care hospital in South Korea between January 2017 and December 2018. Patients who initiated anti-TB treatment after positive cultures were included in the missed TB group, and those who initiated empirical treatment before positive cultures were included in the control group. RESULTS: Of 220 patients included, 117 (53.2{\%}) and 103 (46.8{\%}) were in the missed TB and control groups, respectively. Patients in the missed TB group were older (p = 0.001) and had a higher mean body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.019). Comorbidities (66.9{\%} vs. 46.6{\%}, p = 0.003) and immunocompromised patients (33.1{\%} vs. 20.4{\%}, p = 0.035) were more common in the missed TB group than in the control group. Old age (odds ratio [OR], 1.030; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.012 to 1.048; p = 0.001), high BMI (OR, 1.114; 95{\%} CI, 1.004 to 1.237; p = 0.042), and negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results (OR, 9.551; 95{\%} CI, 4.925 to 18.521; p {\textless} 0.001) were associated with delayed diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: In more than half of patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB, the diagnosis was delayed. Patients with delayed TB diagnosis were older, had higher BMI, and negative PCR results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is one of the serious infectious diseases worldwide; however, the gene network involved in the host response remain largely unclear. METHODS: This study integrated two cohorts profile datasets GSE34608 and GSE83456 to elucidate the potential gene network and signaling pathways in PTB. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained for Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis using Metascape database. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed by the online database the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). Modules were identified by the plug-in APP Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) in Cytoscape. GO and KEGG pathway of Module 1 were further analyzed by STRING. Hub genes were selected for further expression validation in dataset GSE19439. The gene expression level was also investigated in the dataset GSE31348 to display the change pattern during the PTB treatment. RESULTS: Totally, 180 shared DEGs were identified from two datasets. Gene function and KEGG pathway enrichment revealed that DEGs mainly enriched in defense response to other organism, response to bacterium, myeloid leukocyte activation, cytokine production, etc. Seven modules were clustered based on PPI network. Module 1 contained 35 genes related to cytokine associated functions, among which 14 genes, including chemokine receptors, interferon-induced proteins and Toll-like receptors, were identified as hub genes. Expression levels of the hub genes were validated with a third dataset GSE19439. The signature of this core gene network showed significant response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, and correlated with the gene network pattern during anti-PTB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study unveils the coordination of causal genes during PTB infection, and provides a promising gene panel for PTB diagnosis. As major regulators of the host immune response to Mtb infection, the 14 hub genes are also potential molecular targets for developing PTB drugs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Host immune response have a pivotal role in the course of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. IL27 plays both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities in infectious diseases via STAT1/STAT3 mechanism. To investigate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL27 and STAT3 on the susceptibility of tuberculosis, we conducted a large size of case-control study in western Chinese Han population. METHODS: A total of seven SNPs were genotyped using multiplex ligation detection reaction method in 900 patients with tuberculosis and 1534 healthy controls. RESULTS: Variants of three SNPs (rs181206, rs17855750, rs26528) within IL27 gene, the genotype and allele frequencies of rs17855750 were significantly different (p = .013, p = .004, respectively) between the TB patients and healthy controls. Subjects carrying C allele for rs17855750 showed a decreased tuberculosis risk (OR = 0.75, 95{\%} CI = 0.62-0.91, p = .004). Genetic model analysis revealed that dominant modal was associated with lower TB risk (OR = 0.74, 95{\%} CI = 0.60-0.92, p = .042). Haplotype of ACG (representing rs181206, rs17855750 and rs26528) showed a reduced risk to TB (OR = 0.79, 95{\%} CI = 0.65-0.96, p = .017). There were no significant differences between TB cases and healthy controls in the variants of four SNPs (rs1053005, rs2293152, rs744166, rs4796793) within STAT3 gene. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms of IL27, rs17855750, but not rs181206 and rs26528, plays a protective role on the susceptibility to TB.},

Solid-state drug sensitivity tests with streptomycin (SM), isoniazid (INH), RIF, EMB, kanamycin (km), and ofloxacin (ofx) were carried out on H37Rv and different clinical isolates. Briefly, the effects of SM, INH, RIF, EMB (1.0 $\mu$g/mL, 0.1 $\mu$g/mL, 1.0 $\mu$g/mL, 5.0 $\mu$g/mL), and anti-tuberculosis drugs, and their combined effect with 0.15 $\mu$g/mL and 0.30 $\mu$g/mL nano silver on drug-resistant tuberculosis bacteria were evaluated by liquid drug sensitivity test. At the low concentration (0.15 $\mu$g/mL), nano silver could not effectively kill the tuberculosis strains; however, at concentrations ≥0.30 $\mu$g/mL, it could effectively kill H37Rv and the clinical isolates of the sensitive, single-resistant, multi-resistant, multi-resistant, and extensively resistant strains. Combining 0.15 $\mu$g/mL nano silver with the four first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs could not effectively kill the tuberculosis strains; however, combining 0.30 $\mu$g/mL nano silver and the anti-tuberculosis drugs could effectively kill the drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Nano silver exhibits a concentrationdependent killing effect on tubercle bacillus. Further, a nano silver concentration higher than 0.30 $\mu$g/mL could kill sensitive and resistant tubercle bacillus.},

In total, 110 ADLI patients and 120 patients without ADLI controls were enrolled. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the 5-mC and 5-hmC content in DNA from peripheral blood leucocytes. The univariate analysis showed that smoking, drinking, and 5-mC and 5-hmC content of HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 were significantly associated with ADLI. After adjusting for drinking and smoking, we found that 5-mC content of HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 were associated with ADLI (odds ratio [OR] = 0.251 and 0.347, respectively) and 5-hmC contents of HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 were also associated with ADLI (OR = 1.848 and 4.705, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the 5-hmC contents of both HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 were more clinically significant than the 5-mC contents were. The combined 5-hmC level of HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 was the best diagnostic biomarker for ADLI, with the highest areas under the curve (AUC) for 0.953, sensitivity for 0.900 and specificity for 0.875. Therefore, combined 5-hmC levels of HLA-B and HLA-DQB1 could be significant evidence for diagnosis of ADLI.},

abstract = {Tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) is a TRIM family member which is involved in innate immunity. However, its role in the modulation of host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infection has not been investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the significance of TRIM25 in the regulation of macrophage responses to M.tb infection. TRIM25 was found to be significantly overexpressed (3.476-fold) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 67 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis compared with 48 healthy controls. TRIM25 expression was enhanced following M.tb infection of RAW264.7 cells, a macrophage cell line. Overexpression of TRIM25 in M.tb-infected RAW264.7 cells led to a significant increase in phosphorylated p38 levels; however, the production of IL-6, IL-1$\beta$, and TNF-$\alpha$ were significantly reduced. Finally, M.tb intracellular survival increased by 90{\%} at 12 h post-infection (PI) (p {\textless} 0.01). To validate the previous results, TRIM25 levels in M.tb-infected RAW264.7 macrophages were down-regulated using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Therefore, it was concluded that TRIM25 promotes intracellular survival of M.tb in RAW264.7 cells, likely by enhancing p38 pathways and thereby inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines. These results contribute to the further understanding of the host defense against M.tb infection.},

The present study was conducted to determine the mechanism of action of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ in the pathogenesis of osteoarticular tuberculosis. The number of osteoclasts in osteoarticular tuberculosis tissue samples was detected by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Autophagy and apoptosis of osteoclasts were detected by western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, transmission electron microscopy and TUNEL staining. The results showed that autophagy and the number of osteoclasts increased in the lesions of patients with osteoarticular tuberculosis compared with osteoarthritis samples. Moreover, activation of osteoclast autophagy inhibited the apoptosis of osteoclasts infected with M.tb, and increased the expression level of TNF-$\alpha$. The results showed that TNF-$\alpha$ enhanced the autophagic activity of M.tb-infected osteoclasts and inhibited cell apoptosis. These findings indicated that M.tb infection induced osteoclast production and inhibited osteoclast apoptosis by regulating TNF-$\alpha$-mediated osteoclast autophagy, revealing a new mechanism for TNF-$\alpha$ in the pathogenesis of osteoarticular tuberculosis.},

METHODS: An EAU model was established in female mice by injection of interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) emulsion supplemented with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). On day 12 after induction of EAU, specific T cells from spleen and lymph node tissues were isolated and cultured for 4d and the levels of IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17A in the supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). T cells and their supernatants were added to 661W cells to observe the alteration of cell morphology; IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17A were separately added to 661W cells to observe the effect of IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17A on cell proliferation. RESULTS: The levels of IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17A in the T cell supernatants were 1568.64±38.79 pg/mL and 1456.57±46.98 pg/mL, respectively. The supernatants apparently inhibited 661W cell proliferation (P{\textless}0.05). T cells could also attach to the surface of 661W cells, and IFN-$\gamma$ showed a more serious cytotoxic effect on 661W cells than IL-17A, inhibiting cell proliferation (P{\textless}0.01). CONCLUSION: IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17A from T cells of EAU mice model can exert cytotoxic effects on murine photoreceptor cell proliferation, and IFN-$\gamma$ shows more serious cytotoxic effects on murine photoreceptor cells than IL-17A.},

In addition to its clinical presentation, TB has been associated with several other disease-induced systemic complications, such as hyponatremia and glucose intolerance. Here, we provide an overview of the known, although ill-described, underlying biochemical mechanisms responsible for the clinical and systemic presentations associated with this disease and discuss novel hypotheses recently generated by various omics technologies. This summative update can assist clinicians to improve the tentative diagnosis of TB based on a patient's clinical presentation and aid in the development of improved treatment protocols specifically aimed at restoring the disease-induced imbalance for overall homeostasis while simultaneously eradicating the pathogen. Furthermore, future applications of this knowledge could be applied to personalized diagnostic and therapeutic options, bettering the treatment outcome and quality of life of TB patients.},

abstract = {Macrophages are key immune cells for combatting Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, M. tuberculosis possesses means to evade macrophage bactericidal responses by, for instance, secretion of the immunomodulatory para-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives (pHBADs). While these molecules have been implicated in inhibiting macrophage responses in an acute context, little is known about their ability to reprogram macrophages via induction of long-term innate memory. Since innate memory has been highlighted as a promising strategy to augment bactericidal immune responses against M. tuberculosis, investigating corresponding immune evasion mechanisms is highly relevant. Our results reveal for the first time that pHBAD I and related molecules (unmethylated pHBAD I and the hexose l-rhamnose) reduce macrophage bactericidal mechanisms in both the short- and the long-term. Moreover, we demonstrate how methyl-p-anisate hinders bactericidal responses soon after exposure yet results in enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in the long-term. This work highlights new roles for these compounds in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Bedaquiline (BDQ, Sirturo) has been approved to treat multidrug resistant forms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Prior studies suggested that BDQ was a selective inhibitor of the ATP synthase from M. tuberculosis. However, Sirturo treatment leads to an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and death, raising the concern that this adverse effect results from inhibition at a secondary site. Here we show that BDQ is a potent inhibitor of the yeast and human mitochondrial ATP synthases. Single-particle cryo-EM reveals that the site of BDQ inhibition partially overlaps with that of the inhibitor oligomycin. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the binding mode of BDQ to this site is similar to that previously seen for a mycobacterial enzyme, explaining the observed lack of selectivity. We propose that derivatives of BDQ ought to be made to increase its specificity toward the mycobacterial enzyme and thereby reduce the side effects for patients that are treated with Sirturo.},

Quality assessment and heterogeneity evaluation across included studies were performed. RESULTS: A total of 50 articles were included. The respective sensitivity and specificity were 87{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.84-0.89), 91{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.90-0.92) and 95{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.93-0.97) in the adult BAL group; 90{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.88-0.91), 98{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.97-0.98) and 97{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.95-0.99) in the adult ES group; 86{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.84-0.89) and 97{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.96-0.98) in the adult IS group. Xpert MTB/RIF showed the sensitivity and specificity of 14{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.10-0.19) and 99{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.97-1.00) in the pediatric ES group; 80{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.72-0.87) and 94{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.92-0.95) in the pediatric GA group; 67{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.62-0.72) and 99{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.98-0.99) in the pediatric IS group; and 54{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.43-0.64) and 99{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.97-0.99) in the pediatric NPA group. The heterogeneity across included studies was deemed acceptable. CONCLUSION: Considering diagnostic accuracy, cost and sampling process, ES was a better choice than other sample types for diagnosing adult PTB, especially HIV-associated PTB. GA might be more suitable than other sample types for diagnosing pediatric PTB. The actual choice of sample types should also consider the needs of specific situations.},

abstract = {The comparison of the host immune response when challenged with pathogenic and nonpathogenic species of mycobacteria can provide answers to the unresolved question of how pathogens subvert or inhibit an effective response. We infected human monocyte derived macrophages (hMDMs) with different species of mycobacteria, in increasing order of pathogenicity, i.e. M. smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and M. tuberculosis R179 that had been cultured in the absence of detergents. RNA was isolated post-infection and transcriptomic analysis using amplicons (Ampliseq) revealed 274 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across three species, out of which we selected 19 DEGs for further validation. We used qRT-PCR to confirm the differential expression of 19 DEGs. We studied biological network through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis{\textregistered} (IPA) which revealed up-regulated pathways of the interferon and interleukin family related to the killing of M. smegmatis. Apart from interferon and interleukin family, we found one up-regulated (EIF2AK2) and two down-regulated (MT1A and TRIB3) genes as unique potential targets found by Ampliseq and qRT-PCR which may be involved in the intracellular mycobacterial killing. The roles of these genes have not previously been described in tuberculosis. Multiplex ELISA of culture supernatants showed increased host immune response toward M. smegmatis as compared to M. bovis BCG and M.tb R179. These results enhance our understanding of host immune response against M.tb infection.},

abstract = {An accurate urine test for diverse populations with active tuberculosis could be transformative for preventing TB deaths. Urinary liporabinomannan (LAM) testing has been previously restricted to HIV co-infected TB patients. In this study we evaluate urinary LAM in HIV negative, pediatric and adult, pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients. We measured 430 microbiologically confirmed pretreatment tuberculosis patients and controls from Peru, Guinea Bissau, Venezuela, Uganda and the United States using three monoclonal antibodies, MoAb1, CS35, and A194, which recognize distinct LAM epitopes, a one-sided immunoassay, and blinded cohorts. We evaluated sources of assay variability and comorbidities (HIV and diabetes). All antibodies successfully discriminated TB positive from TB negative patients. ROAUC from the average of three antibodies' responses was 0.90; 95{\%} CI 0.87-0.93, 90{\%} sensitivity, 73.5{\%} specificity (80 pg/mL). MoAb1, recognizing the 5-methylthio-D-xylofuranose(MTX)-mannose(Man) cap epitope, performed the best, was less influenced by glycosuria and identified culture positive pediatric (N = 19) and extrapulmonary (N = 24) patients with high accuracy (ROAUC 0.87, 95{\%} CI 0.77-0.98, 0.90 sensitivity 0.80 specificity at 80 pg/mL; ROAUC = 0.96, 95{\%} CI 0.92-0.99, 96{\%} sensitivity, 80{\%} specificity at 82 pg/mL, respectively). The MoAb1 antibody, recognizing the MTX-Man cap epitope, is a novel analyte for active TB detection in pediatric and extrapulmonary disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, the burden of tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus (TB/HIV) is at 24{\%} and this alarming rate compelled the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the African region as a critical workforce shortage area. To facilitate adherence to treatment guidelines, WHO recommended a strategy of task shifting for countries with high health workforce shortages. The strategy aimed at the redistribution of health care tasks to available workers. The study aimed to determine the factors facilitating nurse-initiated management of antiretroviral therapy (NIMART) trained nurses' adherence to TB/HIV treatment guidelines. METHODS: The study employed an exploratory-descriptive design. The study was conducted in Ugu and Ngaka Modiri Molema Districts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and North West (NW) Provinces of South Africa. The population comprised of 24 participants who were purposively selected. The in-depth focus group discussions were conducted and ATLAS T.I. was used for data analysis following the basic steps of notice-collect-think (NCT) analysis. Trustworthiness and adherence to ethics were ensured. RESULTS: The singular theme of factors facilitating NIMART trained nurses' adherence to treatment guidelines which included positive attitudinal needs and positive behavioural change emerged from raw data. CONCLUSION: Continuous training, support supervision, and improved relationships with colleagues need to be enhanced to enable NIMART trained nurses to adhere to treatment guidelines.},

abstract = {This research analyzes the role of the St. John's General Hospital in late nineteenth-century Newfoundland and Labrador using extant admission and discharge records from 17 May 1886 to 30 December 1899. Most individuals were discharged from the hospital as "cured" or "convalescent." Trauma, musculoskeletal issues, and respiratory diseases were the most common reasons for admission, with males significantly more likely to seek care for trauma, sexually transmitted infections, and kidney/bladder issues. Female inpatients were significantly more likely to be admitted for tumours/cancers, anemia, digestive issues, and issues concerning the female anatomy. Notable were the short hospital stays for tuberculosis, indicating the General played an important role before the founding of the St. John's Sanatorium. A snapshot of late nineteenth-century morbidity reveals the complex risks facing citizens of St. John's and beyond who sought care at the General, which played a key role in the rapidly modernizing medical ecosystem.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: US-born non-Hispanic black persons (blacks) (12{\%} of the US population) accounted for 41{\%} of HIV diagnoses during 2008-2014. HIV infection significantly increases TB and TB-related mortality. TB rate ratios were 6 to 7 times as high in blacks versus US-born non-Hispanic whites (whites) during 2013-2016. We analyzed a sample of black and white TB patients to assess the impact of HIV infection on TB racial disparities. METHODS: In total, 552 black and white TB patients with known HIV/AIDS status were recruited from 10 US sites in 2009-2010. We abstracted data from the National TB Surveillance System, medical records, and death certificates and interviewed 477 patients. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of TB with HIV infection, late HIV diagnosis (≤3 months before or any time after TB diagnosis), and mortality during TB treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent of the sample had HIV/AIDS infection. Blacks (AOR = 3.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.7-6.8) and persons with recent homelessness (AOR = 2.5; 95{\%} CI, 1.5-4.3) had greater odds of HIV infection than others. The majority of HIV-infected/TB patients were diagnosed with HIV infection 3 months or less before (57{\%}) or after (4{\%}) TB diagnosis. Among HIV-infected/TB patients, blacks had similar percentages to whites (61{\%} vs 57{\%}) of late HIV diagnosis. Twenty-five percent of HIV-infected/TB patients died, 38{\%} prior to TB diagnosis and 62{\%} during TB treatment. Blacks did not have significantly greater odds of TB-related mortality than whites (AOR = 1.1; 95{\%} CI, 0.6-2.1). CONCLUSIONS: Black TB patients had greater HIV prevalence than whites. While mortality was associated with HIV infection, it was not significantly associated with black or white race.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine-preventable diseases and opportunistic infections in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are increasingly recognized issues. The aims of this study were to evaluate vaccinations, immunization status, and consequent therapeutic management in children with IBD and to analyze the differences among patients diagnosed before (Group 1) and after June 2012 (Group 2). METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort investigation. Between July 2016 and July 2017, 430 children with IBD were enrolled in 13 centers. Diagnosis, therapeutic history, vaccinations, and immunization status screening at diagnosis and at immunosuppressant (IM)/biologic initiation and reasons for incomplete immunization were retrieved. RESULTS: Vaccination rates at diagnosis were unsatisfactory for measles, mumps, and rubella (89.3{\%}), Haemophilus influenzae (81.9{\%}), meningococcus C (23.5{\%}), chickenpox (18.4{\%}), pneumococcus (18.6{\%}), papillomavirus (5.9{\%}), and rotavirus (1.9{\%}). Complete immunization was recorded in 38/430 (8.8{\%}) children, but specific vaccines were recommended in 79/430 patients (18.6{\%}), without differences between the 2 groups. At IM start, 22{\%} of children were tested for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, with 96.2{\%} of EBV-na{\"{i}}ve patients starting azathioprine, without differences between Groups 1 and 2. Screening for latent tuberculosis (TB) before start of biologics was performed in 175/190 (92.1{\%}), with up to 9 different screening strategies and numerous inconsistencies. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a poor immunization status at diagnosis in children with IBD, which was not followed by proper vaccination catch-up. EBV status before IM initiation and latent TB before biologics were not adequately assessed. Thus, the overall impact of the current guidelines seems unsatisfactory.},

Postmortem CT scans of the pathologically affected bones were performed, and 3D reconstructions with Global Illumination Reconstruction software (GIR) were realized, in order to confront antemortem and postmortem data. As a result, the juxtaposition and superimposition of antemortem and postmortem images evidenced several points of correspondence in the position, anatomical contour, character, and morphological characteristics of the bone lesions, thus demonstrating through a concrete case study the potential of morphological features of bone lesions for the personal identification of unknown deceased.},

@article{Mattingly2020,
abstract = {Health organizations worldwide have warned that we are on the cusp of a "post-antibiotic era," necessitating new approaches to combat antibiotic resistant infections. One such approach is the development of antibiotic adjuvants, which have little or no inherent antibiotic activity at their active concentrations but instead potentiate the activity of antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recently we demonstrated that meridianin D, a natural product originally reported to have activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, possesses the ability to reverse colistin resistance in colistin resistant bacteria. As most natural product screens typically involve screening for only certain activities (anti-cancer, anti-viral, and antimicrobial are typical) we posited that the meridianin D discovery was not unique and there are potentially many natural products that have adjuvant activity. To explore this, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Natural Product Library Set IV was screened for adjuvant activity using four classes of antibiotics ($\beta$-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides, and polymyxins) against three bacterial pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Sixteen compounds suppressed $\beta$-lactam resistance in MRSA, five of which effected a 16-fold reduction in oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Two natural products effectively suppressed aminoglycoside resistance in both of the Gram-negative species tested, and no hits were observed with macrolides. In contrast, a larger number of natural product adjuvants were identified when screening against colistin-resistant strains of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae. Nine compounds reduced the colistin MIC to its breakpoint or lower (up to 1024-fold reduction). Clorobiocin, novobiocin, and prodigiosin were most effective, reducing the colistin MIC in K. pneumoniae strain B9 to 2 µg/mL at concentrations as low as 0.625 µM, 2.5 µM, and 1.25 µM, respectively. Restored sensitivity to colistin with these compounds does not appear to coincide with known mechanisms of colistin resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic features, clinical outcomes and diagnostic delay amongst patients with extra-spinal articular tuberculosis (TB) in a low-incidence setting. METHODS: Cases of TB treated at our institution between 2004 and 2014 were identified via the London TB register (LTBR). Demographic features of extra-spinal articular TB cases were compared to controls with TB at all other sites. For articular cases (excluding individuals {\textless}16 years or with spinal TB without peripheral joint involvement) clinical data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: 6,146 TB patients were identified over the study period; 146 (2.4{\%}) cases had extra-spinal articular infection. There was no difference in median age between extra-spinal articular TB cases and controls with TB at other sites (31 vs 32 years, p = 0.57). Articular cases were more likely to be male (70.6{\%} vs 59.5{\%}, p = 0.007), Bangladeshi (28.7{\%} vs 18.0{\%}) or Pakistani (24.0{\%} vs 16.1{\%}) and were less likely to be Black-African (9.5{\%} vs 19.8{\%}) (p {\textless} 0.001). 93 cases were included in the case series; 85 (88.5{\%}) were migrants and 83 (89.2{\%}) were South Asian. Knee and elbow joints were affected in 22 (23.7{\%}) and 18 (19.4{\%}) cases respectively. The median durations of pre-healthcare and healthcare associated delay were 16 and 6 weeks respectively. Where mycobacterial culture was performed, 57/75 (76{\%}) were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 86 (92.5{\%}) cases received standard quadruple therapy for a median of 6 months (IQR 6-9). Recurrence of TB infection occurred in 4 (4.3{\%}) cases and there were no TB related deaths. Seven (7.6{\%}) cases required surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Extra-spinal articular TB more commonly affected men and people of South Asian ethnicity. Significant diagnostic delays were identified, including avoidable healthcare-associated delays.},

abstract = {Mycobacterial infection of the salivary glands is extremely rare, even in endemic countries. Differential diagnosis with benign or malignant neoplasms is challenging, and treatment is often delayed. We describe the case of a 62-year-old female patient who presented with a 2-month-old complaint of a right preauricular painless swelling. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy was performed, with a resulting lymphocytic infiltrate, without clear atypia. MRI demonstrated a lesion with ill-defined contours, described as probably malignant. Because of this mismatch in results, a core biopsy of the main lesion was performed, demonstrating granulomas with central necrosis, with no mycobacteria detected in PCR or culture. As the lesion continued to enlarge, a new biopsy was ordered, and this time Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected. Treatment with extrapulmonary tuberculosis therapy was initiated. The sensitivity of PCR and culture combined is only 73{\%} in extrapulmonary tuberculosis. A systematic approach may prevent unnecessary surgical interventions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the comparative performance of different assays used in a Diagnostic Laboratory Hub that linked 13 HIV healthcare facilities for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, and describing its functions in Guatemala compared with other National Reference Laboratories. METHODS: The following diagnostic techniques were analyzed in 24 months (2017-2018) in a cohort of patients with HIV: smear microscopy, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, isolator blood culture, PCR assays, and antigen detection tests. RESULTS: A total of 4245 patients were included, 716 (16.2{\%}) had an opportunistic infection: 249 (34.7{\%}) TB, 40 (5.6{\%}) nontuberculous mycobacteria, 227 (31.7{\%}) histoplasmosis, 138 (19.3{\%}) cryptococcosis, and 62 (8.6{\%}) had multiple opportunistic infections. Two hundred sixty-three [92.6{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 89-95.1] of TB cases were diagnosed by PCR. Urine antigen assay detected 94{\%} (95{\%} CI, 89-96) of the disseminated histoplasmosis cases. A lateral flow assay to detect cryptococcal antigen diagnosed 97{\%} (95{\%} CI, 93.3-98.7{\%}) of the cryptococcal cases. In 85 patients (51.5{\%}) with a cerobrospinal fluid sample, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 55 (64.7{\%}), of which 18 (32.7{\%}) were only detected by cryptococcal antigen. CONCLUSION: Validated commercial antigen tests, as used in this program, should be the new gold standard for histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diagnosis. In their absence, 35{\%} of disseminated histoplasmosis and 32.7{\%} of cryptococcal meningitis cases would have been missed. Patients with multiple opportunistic infections were frequently diagnosed and strategies should be designed to screen patients irrespective of their clinical presentation. In low resource settings, Diagnostic Laboratory Hubs can deliver quality diagnostics services in record time at affordable prices.},

abstract = {Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has revolutionized the approach and management of many pulmonary and cardiac diseases over the past 2 decades. Thoracoscopic inspection of the pleura, while the patient was under local anesthesia, was first performed by Swedish physician Jacobeaus. This procedure was usually performed to evaluate and treat pleural effusions in patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Before this technique, the standard approach to a thoracic pathology was a thoracotomy. A breakthrough in technology, which ultimately resulted in the advancement of all forms of minimal access surgery, was the development of fiber-optic light. The number of VATS applications have grown over the decades as technological advancements made such procedures safer for the elderly and frail patients. VATS has multiple advantages over traditional thoracotomy including less postoperative pain, shorter hospital lengths of stay, earlier recovery of respiratory function especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the elderly and overall reduced cost.},

abstract = {AIM: To review the current literature and publications to assess the clinical features, recommended investigations and treatment for ocular tuberculosis in HIV infected patients. METHODS: Literature review. RESULTS: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic affects as many as 37.9 million people. Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is common in HIV infection and is a leading cause of death and morbidity. Common clinical presentations include anterior uveitis (granulomatous or otherwise), choroidal granulomas/tubercles, chorioretinitis, subretinal abscess, panophthalmitis, retinal detachment and vasculitis. The majority of clinical findings were in the posterior segment, appeared primarily infective (tubercles/chorioretinitis/abscess) and were largely seen in the context of pulmonary tuberculosis or disseminated disease. Current investigational patterns include corroborative tests such as tuberculin skin test or Interferon-$\gamma$ release assay. Systemic testing includes Computed Tomography, MRI or PET/CT scans. Newer Molecular techniques such as GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and Line Probe assays (LPA) are increasingly important. Apart from standard ocular anti-inflammatory protocols, anti-tubercular treatment as per the clinical staging (latent or active) needs to be initiated. Initiation of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is important and can be started soon after ATT. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular manifestations within this group are distinct and unique investigational and therapeutic approaches are needed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Afghanistan is affected by one of the world's longest protracted armed conflicts, frequent natural disasters, disease outbreaks and large population movements and it suffers from a high burden of tuberculosis (TB), including rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB). The study shows M{\'{e}}decins Sans Fronti{\`{e}}res' experiences with care for patients with RR-TB in Kandahar Province. We describe the uptake of RR-TB treatment, how World Health Organisation criteria for the choice between the short and an individualized regimen were implemented, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analysis of routinely collected data from RR-TB patients enrolled in care from 2016 until 2019. Descriptive analysis was performed to present characteristics of patients and treatment outcomes. Multivariable Cox analysis was performed to identify risk factors for having an unfavourable treatment outcome. RESULTS: Out of 146 enrolled RR-TB patients, 112 (76.7{\%}) started treatment: 41 (36.6{\%}) and 71 (63.4{\%}) with the short and individualized treatment regimen, respectively. Of 82 with results for fluoroquinolone susceptibility, 39 (47.6{\%}) had fluoroquinolone-resistant TB. Seven patients with initially fluoroquinolone-resistant TB and three pregnant women started the short regimen and 18 patients eligible for the short regimen started the injectable-free individualized regimen. Overall, six-month smear and culture conversion were 98.7{\%} and 97.1{\%}, respectively; treatment success was 70.1{\%}. Known initial fluoroquinolone resistance (aHR 3.77, 95{\%}CI:1.53-9.27) but not choice of regimen predicted having an unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION: Even though criteria for the choice of treatment regimen were not applied strictly, we have achieved acceptable outcomes in this cohort. To expand RR-TB care, treatment regimens should fit provision at primary health care level and take patient preferences into account.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is the causative agent of TB and its incidences has been on the rise since 1993. Lipid metabolism is an imperative metabolic process, which grants M. tb the ability to utilize host-derived lipids as a secondary source of nutrition during infection. In addition to degrading host lipids, M. tb is proficient at using lipids, such as cholesterol, to facilitate its entry into macrophages. Mycolic acids, constituents of the mycobacterial cell wall, offer protection and aid in persistence of the bacterium. These are effectively synthesized using a complex fatty acid synthase system. Many pathogenesis studies have reported differences in lipid-metabolism of clinical strains of M. tb that belongs to diverse lineages of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC). East-Asian and Euro-American lineages possess "unique" cell wall-associated lipids compared to the less transmissible Ethiopian lineage, which may offer these lineages a competitive advantage. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehend the complexities among the MTBC lineages with lipid metabolism and their impact on virulence, transmissibility and pathogenesis. Thus, this review provides an insight into lipid metabolism in various lineages of the MTBC and their impact on virulence and persistence during infection, as this may provide critical insight into developing novel therapeutics to combat TB.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: B-cells are essential in the defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Studies on isolated cells may not accurately reflect the responses that occur in vivo due to the presence of other cells. This study elucidated the influence of microenvironment complexity on B-cell polarization and function in the context of tuberculosis disease. METHODS: B-cell function was tested in whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and as isolated cells. The different fractions were stimulated and the B-cell phenotype and immunoglobulin profiles analyzed. RESULTS: The immunoglobulin profile and developmental B-cell frequencies varied for each of the investigated sample types, while in an isolated cellular environment, secretion of immunoglobulin isotypes immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG2, and IgG3 was hampered. The differences in the immunoglobulin profile highlight the importance of cell-cell communication for B-cell activation. Furthermore, a decrease in marginal zone B-cell frequencies and an increase in T1 B-cells was observed following cell isolation, indicating impaired B-cell development in response to in vitro antigenic stimulation in isolation. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that humoral B-cell function and development was impaired likely due to a lack of costimulatory signals from other cell types. Thus, B-cell function should ideally be studied in a PBMC or whole blood fraction.},

We describe a case of tuberculous peritonitis with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The abnormally high serum sIL-2R value and negative findings for other possible causes including lymphoma suggested tuberculous peritonitis and we administered anti-tuberculosis treatment before definitive diagnosis. Abnormally high serum sIL-2R levels may contribute to earlier diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis, along with ruling out other potential differential diagnoses.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Host blood transcriptomic biomarkers have potential as rapid point-of-care triage, diagnostic, and predictive tests for Tuberculosis disease. We aimed to summarise the performance of host blood transcriptomic signatures for diagnosis of and prediction of progression to Tuberculosis disease; and compare their performance to the recommended World Health Organisation target product profile. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of host blood mRNA signatures for diagnosing and predicting progression to Tuberculosis disease in HIV-negative adults and adolescents, in studies with an independent validation cohort. Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO libraries were searched for articles published between January 2005 and May 2019, complemented by a search of bibliographies. Study selection, data extraction and quality assessment were done independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed for signatures that were validated in ≥3 comparable cohorts, using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS: Twenty studies evaluating 25 signatures for diagnosis of or prediction of progression to TB disease in a total of 68 cohorts were included. Eighteen studies evaluated 24 signatures for TB diagnosis and 17 signatures met at least one TPP minimum performance criterion. Three diagnostic signatures were validated in clinically relevant cohorts to differentiate TB from other diseases, with pooled sensitivity 84{\%}, 87{\%} and 90{\%} and pooled specificity 79{\%}, 88{\%} and 74{\%}, respectively. Four studies evaluated signatures for progression to TB disease and performance of one signature, assessed within six months of TB diagnosis, met the minimal TPP for a predictive test for progression to TB disease. CONCLUSION: Host blood mRNA signatures hold promise as triage tests for TB. Further optimisation is needed if mRNA signatures are to be used as standalone diagnostic or predictive tests for therapeutic decision-making.},

abstract = {Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that results in chronic inflammation and damage of more than one organ. It is diagnosed clinically and serologically with the presence of autoantibodies. "Lupus" is a Latin term meaning "wolf," since one of the hallmark facial SLE rashes is similar to the bitemark of a wolf. In 400 BC, the "father of medicine," Hippocrates, was the first to document a case of lupus. In 1700 to 1800s, lupus was debated on whether it was associated with tuberculosis versus syphilis. Lupus evolved from being viewed as solely a dermatologic manifestation into an evolving multisystemic disease. One common manifestation that should be monitored for in SLE is involvement of the kidneys, known as lupus nephritis (LN). Lupus nephritis typically occurs after at least three years since the onset of SLE. Monitoring for development of lupus nephritis is done with serial creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatine ratio, and urinalysis. This evaluates if there is a rise in creatinine value from baseline creatinine and for the presence of proteinuria seen with lupus nephritis. Since lupus nephritis carries a high risk for increased morbidity, treatment plays an important role in preventing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The only licensed live Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine used to prevent severe childhood tuberculosis comprises genetically divergent strains with variable protective efficacy and rates of BCG-induced adverse events. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allowed evaluating the genome stability of BCG strains and the impact of spontaneous heterogeneity in seed and commercial lots on the efficacy of BCG-vaccines in different countries. Our study aimed to assess sequence variations and their putative effects on genes and protein functions in the BCG-1 (Russia) seed lots compared to their progeny isolates available from immunocompetent children with BCG-induced disease (mainly, osteitis). RESULTS: Based on the WGS data, we analyzed the links between seed lots 361, 367, and 368 used for vaccine manufacture in Russia in different periods, and their nine progeny isolates recovered from immunocompetent children with BCG-induced disease. The complete catalog of variants in genes relative to the reference genome (GenBank: CP013741) included 4 synonymous and 8 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms, and 3 frameshift deletions. Seed lot 361 shared variants with 2 of 6 descendant isolates that had higher proportions of such polymorphisms in several genes, including ppsC, eccD5, and eccA5 involved in metabolism and cell wall processes and reportedly associated with virulence in mycobacteria. One isolate preserved variants of its parent seed lot 361 without gain of further changes in the sequence profile within 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: The background genomic information allowed us for the first time to follow the BCG diversity starting from the freeze-dried seed lots to descendant clinical isolates. Sequence variations in several genes of seed lot 361 did not alter the genomic stability and viability of the vaccine and appeared accumulated in isolates during the survival in the human organism. The impact of the observed variations in the context of association with the development of BCG-induced disease should be evaluated in parallel with the immune status and host genetics. Comparative genomic studies of BCG seed lots and their descendant clinical isolates represent a beneficial approach to better understand the molecular bases of efficacy and adverse events during the long-term survival of BCG in the host organism.},

abstract = {AIM: Intestinal tuberculosis (ITb) and Crohn's disease (CD) mimic each other often leading to misdiagnosis. We evaluated the difference between ITb and CD using the extent of apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes. METHODS: CD4(+) cells as a percentage of the lymphocytes and viable, dead, total apoptotic, early apoptotic, and late apoptotic CD4(+) cells were assessed in the peripheral blood by flow cytometry in healthy controls and patients with confirmed active ITb and CD prior to initiating therapy. Early apoptotic and total apoptotic cells were further expressed as a proportion of the percentage of CD4(+) cells. RESULTS: The percentages of CD4(+) cells (6.5 [3.0, 8.7] vs. 13.40 [10.15, 13.40]; p {\textless} 0.001), total apoptotic cells (0.13 [0.0, 0.22] vs. 0.08 [0.0, 0.21]; p = 0.045), early apoptotic (1.24 [0.55, 2.54] vs. 0.71 [0.40, 1.30]; p = 0.037), and the proportion of the latter two parameters (17.18 [5.61, 57.33] vs. 4.84 [2.71, 9.83]; p-value 0.039) and (17.18 [7.4, 67.50] vs. 5.51 [3.10, 11.03]; p-value 0.036) were significantly different between patients with ITb and CD. The best sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the diagnosis of ITb were seen with the CD4(+) cell percentage (82.6{\%}, 82.4{\%}, 86.4{\%}, 77.8{\%}, respectively) and the proportion of early apoptotic cells (73.9{\%}, 70.6{\%}, 77.3{\%}, 66.7{\%}, respectively). CONCLUSION: CD4(+) cells as a percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes and the proportion of early apoptotic CD4(+) cells show promise to diagnostic differentiation between ITb and CD.},

abstract = {Targeting energy metabolism in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a new paradigm in the search for innovative anti-TB drugs. NADH:menaquinone oxidoreductase is a non-proton translocating type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) that is an essential enzyme in the respiratory chain of Mtb and is not found in mammalian mitochondria. Phenothiazines (PTZs) represent one of the most known class of NDH-2 inhibitors, but their use as anti-TB drugs is currently limited by the wide range of potentially serious off-target effects. In this work, we designed and synthesized a series of new PTZs by decorating the scaffold in an unconventional way, introducing various halogen atoms. By replacing the sulfur atom with selenium, a dibromophenoselenazine 20 was also synthesized. Among the synthesized poly-halogenated PTZs (HPTZs), dibromo and tetrachloro derivatives 9 and 11, along with the phenoselenazine 20, emerged with a better anti-TB profile than the therapeutic thioridazine (TZ). They targeted non-replicating Mtb, were bactericidal, and synergized with rifampin and bedaquiline. Moreover, their anti-TB activity was found to be related to the NDH-2 inhibition. Most important, they showed a markedly reduced affinity to dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors respect to the TZ. From this work emerged, for the first time, as the poly-halogenation of the PTZ core, while permitting to maintain good anti-TB profile could conceivably lead to fewer CNS side-effects risk, making more tangible the use of PTZs for this alternative therapeutic application.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: People with HIV (PWHIV) are likely to need therapies for comorbidities as they age. We assessed risk of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in PWHIV. METHODS: The Climate-HIV electronic recording system was used to cross-sectionally analyse records from PWHIV aged ≥ 18 years attending four UK HIV units with a current antiretroviral (ARV) prescription in February 2018. Antiretroviral and non-ARV medications were categorized by clinical significance of DDIs (University of Liverpool DDI tool). Potential DDIs were predicted using treatment guidelines for commonly recorded comorbidities. RESULTS: Among 4630 PWHIV (44{\%} female), 41{\%} were ≥ 50 years old. The average number of non-ARV comedications increased from {\textless} 1 for patients aged ≤ 24 years to {\textgreater} 5 for patients aged ≥ 75 years; 65{\%} were taking one or more non-ARV comedications. The median (interquartile range) number of non-ARVs was 1 (0-2) and 2 (1-5) for those aged {\textless} 50 and ≥ 50 years, respectively. Common comorbidities/concurrent health conditions occurred more frequently in patients aged ≥ 50 years vs. {\textless} 50 (53{\%} vs. 34{\%}). Boosted protease inhibitors were associated with the highest proportion of contraindicated comedications; dolutegravir and raltegravir had the fewest. For non-ARVs, sildenafil and quetiapine were most likely to result in DDIs. Guideline-recommended treatments for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis had the highest proportions of contraindications when combined with ARV regimens, while treatments for hepatitis C, malignancy, and mental health conditions had the highest proportion of combinations potentially causing DDIs requiring dose monitoring or adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Non-ARV use by PWHIV is high and increases with age. Treatment decisions for ageing PWHIV should consider guideline recommendations for comorbidities.},

abstract = {The development of a more efficient vaccine is needed to improve tuberculosis control. One of the current approaches is to identify immunogenic T-cell peptides that can elicit a protective and specific immune response. These peptides come from immunogenic proteins of the pathogen. The PE{\_}PGRS33 protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proved immunogenic. However, little is known about immunogenic T-cell peptides of PE{\_}PGRS33 and their interactions with MHC-II molecules. Therefore, we used the SYFPHEITHI database to determine the immunogenic PE{\_}PGRS33 T-cell peptides. Next, we built homology models by using MOE v2018.1 software in order to obtain information about the specific interactions between the peptides and I-A(k). The AlgPred server was employed to look for allergenic sites in PE{\_}PGRS33. We developed a sequence alignment between PE{\_}PGRS33 and all the human proteins by using BLAST. Three peptides were commercially synthesized, and their activity was evaluated in vitro by the stimulation of PBMC from household contacts of TB patients. Our in silico results showed five immunogenic T-cell peptides. BLAST analysis showed low homology of PE{\_}PGRS33 with human proteins and AlgPred did not reveal allergenic sites in PE{\_}PGRS33. The three peptides triggered the activation of CD4(+) T cells from the households contacts, showed by the production of IFN-$\gamma$. We identified three immunogenic peptides of PE{\_}PGRS33 that demonstrated activity in vitro which allows to deepen into the immune response towards mycobacterial antigens, moving forward to the identification of new vaccine candidates.},

abstract = {The present study describes the optimization of a simple and reliable method for the determination of four first line antitubercular drugs in human plasma. The studied analytes were isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E) in fixed dose combination recommended to patients under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP, India). The analytes were extracted from the human plasma (150 $\mu$L) using the single step liquid-liquid extraction approach and were analyzed by liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The method was fully validated, according to USFDA guidelines. A linear range of 0.05-10 $\mu$g mL(-1), 0.1-20 $\mu$g mL(-1), 0.5-100 $\mu$g mL(-1) and 0.05-10 $\mu$g mL(-1) for H, R, Z and E respectively was established, presenting determination coefficients above 0.99. Concerning imprecision, the CV was lower than 15{\%} for all analytes. All tested analytes were found to be stable in the samples. Although the values obtained for recovery were above 85{\%}, the method proved to be sensitive, since low detection limits of 0.05 $\mu$g mL(-1) for H and E, 0.1 $\mu$g mL(-1) for R and 0.5 $\mu$g mL(-1) for Z were obtained. The intra-day and inter-day accuracy and imprecision were within CV ±15{\%}. The use of the conventional silica column in the extraction of these compounds through a single step protein precipitation method simplifies the analytical process. In addition due to its simplicity and sensitivity, it can be applied to carry out therapeutic drug monitoring and drug level assessment in human plasma samples. The results of analyte levels are comparable to other reported methods. The method had been successfully applied for simultaneous determination of first line anti-tubercular drugs in pulmonary tubercular patients. The method requires 150 $\mu$L of patient plasma and offers low volume for injection (10 $\mu$L) and blood sample collection (3 mL) which will be an added advantage for pediatric anti-TB drug level assessment and monitoring.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mixed/polyclonal infections due to different genotypes are reported in Tuberculosis. The current study was designed to understand the fate of mixed infections during the course of treatment and follow-up and its role in disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Sputum samples were collected on 0,1,2,3,6,12 and 24 months from 157 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients, cultures subjected to Drug-Susceptibility-testing (MGIT 960), spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR and SNP genotyping. All isolated colonies on thin layer agar (7H11) were subjected to spoligotyping. FINDINGS: One thirty three baseline cultures were positive (133/157, 84.7{\%}), 43(32.3{\%}) had mixture of genotypes. Twenty-four of these patients (55.8{\%}) showed change in genotype while six showed different drug-susceptibility patterns while on treatment. Twenty-three (53.5{\%}) patients with polyclonal infections showed resistance to at least one drug compared to 10/90 (11.1{\%}) monoclonal infections (P{\textless}0.0001). Eight patients had recurrent TB, two with a new genotype and two with altered phenotypic DST. CONCLUSIONS: The coexistence of different genotypes and change of genotypes during the same disease episode, while on treatment, confirms constancy of polyclonal infections. The composition of the mixture of genotypes and the relative predominance may be missed by culture due to its limit of detection. Polyclonal infections in TB could be a rule rather than exception and challenges the age-old dogma of reactivation/reinfection.},

ChN-CFP10 and ChN-CFP21 nanoparticles have both protective and therapeutic potential against Mtb. In the group of mice immunized with CHN-CFP-10 the number of colonies reduced significantly from day 15 to day 60. ChN-CFP-21 showed maximum protection in ChN-CFP-21 immunized mice.

The top three causes were tuberculosis (n = 43, 28.3{\%}), lymphoma (n = 19, 12.5{\%}) and adult-onset Still's disease (n = 12, 7.9{\%}). Tuberculosis predominated in all age groups, and about 70{\%} of cases had the extrapulmonary form, the most common being gastrointestinal. Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas were equally distributed, but solid malignancies were uncommon. Adult-onset Still's disease was the second commonest cause in adults aged ≤ 40 years. Fever resolved spontaneously in 12/19 cases of undiagnosed cause. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis remains the most prevalent PUO in India.},

abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the innate recognition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by host immune cells. However, controversy has arisen regarding the role of TLR4 in determining the outcomes of Mtb infection. To address this controversy, the function of TLR4 in the induction of an optimal protective immune response against the highly virulent Mtb K-infection was comparatively investigated in C3 H/HeJ (TLR4-deficient mutant) and C3 H/HeN (TLR4-competent wild-type) mice. Interestingly, following Mtb infection, C3 H/HeJ mice showed a more severe disease phenotype than C3 H/HeN mice, exhibiting reduced weight and a marked increase in bacterial burden along with necrotic lung inflammation. Analysis of the immune cell composition revealed significantly increased neutrophils in the lung and significant production of IL-10 accompanied by the impairment of the protective Th1 response in C3 H/HeJ mice. Reducing the neutrophil numbers by treating C3 H/HeJ mice with an anti-Ly6 G monoclonal antibody (mAb) and blocking IL-10 signaling with an anti-IL-10 receptor mAb reduced the excessive lung inflammation and bacterial burden in C3 H/HeJ mice. Therefore, abundant IL-10 signaling and neutrophils have detrimental effects in TLR4-deficient mice during Mtb infection. However, the blockade of IL-10 signaling produced an increase in the CD11b(hi)Ly6 G(hi) neutrophil population, but the phenotypes of these neutrophils were different from those of the CD11b(int)Ly6 G(int) neutrophils from mice with controlled infections. Collectively, these results show that TLR4 positively contributes to the generation of an optimal protective immunity against Mtb infection. Furthermore, investigating the TLR4-mediated response will provide insight for the development of effective control measures against tuberculosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health burden. There still remains a large gap between the notified and estimated incident cases. Extrapulmonary (EP) TB represent 15{\%} of all TB cases and the diagnosis is more challenging due to the paucity of the organism. Smear microscopy is often insensitive and culture methods are prolonged. With the introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF and more recently Xpert Ultra, this has changed TB diagnostics by providing a rapid accessible platform to diagnose TB and identify rifampicin resistance within 2 hours. AREAS COVERED: The diagnostic accuracy and the clinical role of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra in the different forms of EPTB. EXPERT OPINION: Whilst significant advances have been made in TB diagnostics, there is still a need to optimise the diagnostic yield of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra in EPTB samples. Research is needed to facilitate standardisation and optimal preparation of samples as well as understanding the role of Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert Ultra in different burden settings. Alongside the current GeneXpert platform, the launch of rapid second line drug resistance polymerase chain reactions and whole genome sequencing may help tackle the global health burden with a more comprehensive diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment.},

abstract = {Macrophages represent the first line of defence against the invading Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In order to enhance intracellular survival, Mtb targets various components of the host signalling pathways to limit macrophage functions. Outcome of Mtb infection depends on various factors derived from both host and pathogen. Detailed understanding of such factors operating during interaction of the pathogen with the host is a prerequisite for designing new approaches for combating mycobacterial infections. In this work, we analysed the role of host phospholipase C-$\gamma$1 (PLC-$\gamma$1) in regulating mycobacterial uptake and killing by J774A.1 murine macrophages. siRNA mediated knockdown of PLC-$\gamma$1 increased internalization and reduced intracellular survival of both Mtb and Mycobacterium smegmatis (MS) by macrophages. Downregulation of host PLC-$\gamma$1 was observed during the course of mycobacterial infection within these macrophages. Finally, Mtb infection also suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (RANTES) which was restored by knocking down PLC-$\gamma$1 in J774A.1 cells. Our observations suggest a role of host PLC-$\gamma$1 in uptake and killing of mycobacteria by murine macrophages. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Beijing genotype comprises a highly disseminated strain type that is frequently associated with multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) and increased transmissibility but, countries such as Portugal and Guinea-Bissau fall outside the regions phylogeographically associated with this specific genotype. Nevertheless, recent data shows that this genotype might be gradually emerging in these two countries as an underlying cause of primary MDR-TB. Here, we describe the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains associated with MDR-TB in Portugal and Guinea-Bissau demonstrating the presence of the well described superclusters 100-32 and 94-32 in Portugal and Guinea-Bissau, respectively. Genome-wide analysis and comparison with a global genomic dataset of M. tuberculosis Beijing strains, revealed the presence of two genomic clusters encompassing isolates from Portugal and Guinea-Bissau, GC1 (n = 121) and GC2 (n = 39), both of which bore SNP signatures compatible with the 100-32/B0/W148 and 94-32/Central Asia Outbreak clades, respectively. Moreover, GC2 encompasses a cross-border cluster between Portugal, Guinea-Bissau and Brazil thus supporting migration-associated introduction of MDR-TB and subsequent clonal expansion at the community-level. The comparison with global Beijing datasets demonstrates the global reach of the disease and its complex dissemination across multiple countries while in parallel there are clear microevolutionary trajectories towards extensively drug resistant TB.},

abstract = {Xpert MTB/RIF assay, a real-time PCR assay designed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has proven sensitive and specific when performed on respiratory samples in a high prevalence setting. However, it was suggested as less accurate in a low-incidence environment. We evaluated the accuracy of the Xpert for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) on pulmonary and extrapulmonary samples in Geneva (Switzerland), where the prevalence of active TB is very low. From March 2009 to February 2013, the Xpert was performed on clinical samples. All specimens were also processed using auramine, AFB staining, and mycobacterial culture with both solid and liquid media. The accuracy of both microscopy and Xpert was determined retrospectively using cultures as the reference method. A total of 732 clinical specimens were processed with the Xpert. The Xpert had a high specificity (97.5{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 95.8-98.5{\%}) and revealed much more sensitive (82.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 74.1-89.0{\%}) than microscopy (55.5{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 45.7-64.8{\%}) for the diagnosis of TB, with a high negative predictive value (96.8{\%}; 95{\%} CI, 95.0-98.0{\%}). The advantage of PCR over microscopy was even more pronounced for extrapulmonary specimens (sensitivity of 70{\%} (95{\%} CI, 50.4-84.6{\%}) compared with 23.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 10.6-42.7{\%})). Despite the low prevalence of TB in Switzerland, results performance for respiratory samples was similar to that reported in high prevalence countries. The high negative predictive value is clinically helpful in our setting, where pulmonary TB needs to be reasonably ruled out. When considering extrapulmonary samples, microscopy performed poorly compared with Xpert. This study shows that the Xpert remains accurate and useful in a low-incidence setting.},

abstract = {The state of latency occurs when a microbe's persistence in a host produces host damage without perturbing homeostasis sufficiently to cause clinical symptoms or disease. The mechanisms contributing to latency are diverse and depend on the nature of both the microbe and the host. Latency has advantages for both host and microbe. The host avoids progressive damage caused by interaction with the microbe that may translate into disease, and the microbe secures a stable niche in which to survive. Latency is clinically important because some latent microbes can be transmitted to other hosts, and it is associated with a risk for recrudescent microbial growth and development of disease. In addition, it can predispose the host to other diseases, such as malignancies. Hence, latency is a temporally unstable state with an eventual outcome that mainly depends on host immunity. Latency is an integral part of the pathogenic strategies of microbes that require human (and/or mammalian) hosts, including herpesviruses, retroviruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Toxoplasma gondii. However, latency is also an outcome of infection with environmental organisms such as Cryptococcus neoformans, which require no host in their replicative cycles. For most microbes that achieve latency, there is a need for a better understanding and more investigation of host and microbial mechanisms that result in this state.},

CD4 proportion was significantly low in TBDM (p=0.003), PTB (p=0.0008) and HHC (p=0.005) when compared to HCs and increased with treatment in PTB at 6M and 12M (p=0.008). CD8 percentage was significantly low in DM (p=0.01); Significantly high mean percentage was observed with respect to CD14 in TBDM (p=0.008), PTB (p=0.018), HHC (p=0.008) and DM (p=0.014); with CD16 in TBDM (p=0.0001), PTB (p=0.0001), HHC (p=0.045); with CD56 in TBDM (p=0.0003), PTB (p=0.002) and HHC (p=0.015) respectively when compared to HCs. These results indicate that TBDM patients have altered lymphocyte homeostasis and FACS analysis might have the potential of a non-invasive clinical indicator for the early detection and monitoring of TB in HHC.},

Reusability of the catalyst up to five cycles without any significant loss in the yields of the product is the unique feature of this heterogeneous solid catalysis. Furthermore, the noteworthy highlights of this method are safe reaction profiles, broad substrate scope, excellent yields, economical, solvent-free, and simple workup conditions. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antitubercular (TB) activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv. Among the screened compounds 3c, 3d, 3f, 3m, and 3r had MIC values of 2.15, 2.78, 5.75, 1.36, and 0.75 $\mu$M, respectively, and exhibited more potency than the reference drugs pyrazinamide (MIC: 3.12 $\mu$M), ciprofloxacin (MIC: 4.73 $\mu$M), and ethambutol (7.61 $\mu$M). Besides, potent compounds (3c, 3d, 3f, 3m, and 3r) have been tested for inhibition of MabA ($\beta$-ketoacyl-ACP reductase) enzyme and cytotoxic activity against mammalian Vero cell line. A molecular docking study was carried out on the MabA (PDB ID: 1UZN) enzyme to predict the interactions of the synthesized compounds. The results of the in vitro anti-TB activity and docking study showed that synthesized compounds have a strong anti-TB activity and can be adapted and produced more effectively as a lead compound.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ratios of different immune cell populations (i.e., monocyte-to-lymphocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios) have been studied as a means of predicting future tuberculosis (TB) disease risk or to assist in the diagnosis of incident TB disease. No studies to-date, however, have evaluated the potential of these ratios to predict or assist in the diagnosis of incident TB infection - the first step in the natural history of TB disease. METHODS: In this prospective study, we evaluated the complete blood count (CBC)-derived metrics of monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as predictors of future TB infection risk or aids in the diagnosis of TB infection among 145 Tanzanian adolescents enrolled in the DAR-901 vaccine trial, using paired CBCs and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) obtained at 0, 60 and 720 days after study enrollment. RESULTS: At baseline, there were no significant differences between study participants who remained persistently IGRA negative throughout the study period and those who subsequently converted to IGRA positive with respect to MLR (0.18 vs 0.17, p = 0.10), NLR (0.88 vs 1.02, p = 0.08), or PLR (115 vs 120, p = 0.28). Similarly, no significant differences were noted with respect to MLR, NLR, and PLR between IGRA converters and time-matched negative controls at the time of IGRA conversion. With respect to other blood cell measures, however, there were modest but significant differences between IGRA negatives and IGRA converters with respect to red blood cell count (4.8 vs 4.6 ×  10(6) cells/mcL, p = 0.008), hemoglobin (12.6 vs 12.3 g/dL, p = 0.01), and hematocrit (38.8 vs 37.8{\%}, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior studies that have suggested that the ratios of different immune cell populations are associated with development of TB disease, our present findings do not demonstrate an association between these ratios and the development of TB infection. However, decreased red blood cell measures were associated with the subsequent development of TB infection, suggesting either that dysregulation of iron metabolism may play a role in TB pathogenesis or that following TB infection, iron dysregulation may precede IGRA positivity.

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is now a leading cause of mortality in people with HIV (PWH). High blood pressure is the major driver of cardiovascular disease. Despite this, little is known about blood pressure in PWH during the early years of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In this prospective cohort study in Tanzania, the authors conducted unobserved blood pressure measurements at enrollment, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in 500 PWH initiating ART and 504 HIV-uninfected adults. The authors excluded measurements taken on antihypertensive medications. Although PWH had a significantly lower blood pressure before ART initiation, they had a significantly greater increase in blood pressure during the first 2 years of ART compared to HIV-uninfected controls. Blood pressure correlates in PWH differed from HIV-uninfected controls. In PWH, lower baseline CD4(+) T-cell counts were associated with lower blood pressure, and greater increases in CD4(+) T-cell counts on ART were associated with greater increases in blood pressure, both on average and within individuals. In addition, PWH with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textless}90 mm Hg at the time of ART initiation had {\~{}}30{\%} mortality in the following 3 months due to occult infections. These patients require careful investigation for occult infections, and those with tuberculosis may benefit from corticosteroids.},

abstract = {The phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosyltransferase A (PimA) is an essential peripheral membrane glycosyltransferase that initiates the biosynthetic pathway of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), key structural elements and virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PimA undergoes functionally important conformational changes, including (i) $\alpha$-helix-to-$\beta$-strand and $\beta$-strand-to-$\alpha$-helix transitions and (ii) an "open-to-closed" motion between the two Rossmann-fold domains, a conformational change that is necessary to generate a catalytically competent active site. In previous work, we established that GDP-Man and GDP stabilize the enzyme and facilitate the switch to a more compact active state. To determine the structural contribution of the mannose ring in such an activation mechanism, we analyzed a series of chemical derivatives, including mannose phosphate (Man-P) and mannose pyrophosphate-ribose (Man-PP-RIB), and additional GDP derivatives, such as pyrophosphate ribose (PP-RIB) and GMP, by the combined use of X-ray crystallography, limited proteolysis, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, and small angle X-ray scattering methods. Although the $\beta$-phosphate is present, we found that the mannose ring, covalently attached to neither phosphate (Man-P) nor PP-RIB (Man-PP-RIB), does promote the switch to the active compact form of the enzyme. Therefore, the nucleotide moiety of GDP-Man, and not the sugar ring, facilitates the "open-to-closed" motion, with the $\beta$-phosphate group providing the high-affinity binding to PimA. Altogether, the experimental data contribute to a better understanding of the structural determinants involved in the "open-to-closed" motion not only observed in PimA but also visualized and/or predicted in other glycosyltransfeases. In addition, the experimental data might prove to be useful for the discovery and/or development of PimA and/or glycosyltransferase inhibitors.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb protein tyrosine phosphatase B (mPTPB) is a virulence factor required for Mtb survival in host macrophages. Consequently, mPTPB represents an exciting target for tuberculosis treatment. Here, we identified N-phenyl oxamic acid as a highly potent and selective monoacid-based phosphotyrosine mimetic for mPTPB inhibition. SAR studies on the initial hit, compound 4 (IC(50) = 257 nM), resulted in several highly potent inhibitors with IC(50) values lower than 20 nM for mPTPB. Among them, compound 4t showed a K(i) of 2.7 nM for mPTPB with over 4500-fold preference over 25 mammalian PTPs. Kinetic, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis analyses confirmed these compounds as active site-directed reversible inhibitors of mPTPB. These inhibitors can reverse the altered host cell immune responses induced by the bacterial phosphatase. Furthermore, the inhibitors possess molecular weights {\textless}400 Da, log D(7.4) {\textless} 2.5, topological polar surface area {\textless} 75, ligand efficiency {\textgreater} 0.43, and good aqueous solubility and metabolic stability, thus offering excellent starting points for further therapeutic development.},

abstract = {We have identified a previously unknown mechanism of reversible high-level ethambutol (EMB) resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is caused by a reversible frameshift mutation in the M. tuberculosis orn gene. A frameshift mutation in orn produces the small-colony-variant (SCV) phenotype, but this mutation does not change the MICs of any drug for wild-type M. tuberculosis However, the same orn mutation in a low-level EMB-resistant double embB-aftA mutant (MIC = 8 $\mu$g/ml) produces an SCV with an EMB MIC of 32 $\mu$g/ml. Reversible resistance is indistinguishable from a drug-persistent phenotype, because further culture of these orn-embB-aftA SCV mutants results in rapid reversion of the orn frameshifts, reestablishing the correct orn open reading frame, returning the culture to normal colony size, and reversing the EMB MIC back to that (8 $\mu$g/ml) of the parental strain. Transcriptomic analysis of orn-embB-aftA mutants compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis identified a 27-fold relative increase in the expression of embC, which is a cellular target for EMB. Expression of embC in orn-embB-aftA mutants was also increased 5-fold compared to that in the parental embB-aftA mutant, whereas large-colony orn frameshift revertants of the orn-embB-aftA mutant had levels of embC expression similar to that of the parental embB-aftA strain. Reversible frameshift mutants may contribute to a reversible form of microbiological drug resistance in human tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are potential targets of vaccination and host-directed therapeutics for tuberculosis, but the role of MAIT cells during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in vivo is not well understood. Here we find that following Mtb infection MAIT cells mount minimal responses, and MAIT cell-deficient MR1(-/-) mice display normal survival. Preinfection expansion of MAIT cells through 5-OP-RU vaccination fails to protect against subsequent Mtb challenge. In fact, 5-OP-RU vaccination delays Mtb-specific CD4 T cell priming in lung-draining lymph nodes, and conversely MR1 deficiency or blockade accelerates T cell priming. The MAIT cell-mediated delay in T cell priming is partly dependent on TGF-$\beta$. Surprisingly, 5-OP-RU treatment during chronic infection drives MAIT cell expansion and an IL-17A-dependent reduction in bacterial loads. Thus, during early infection MAIT cells directly contribute to the notoriously slow priming of CD4 T cells, but later during infection MAIT cell stimulation may be an effective host-directed therapy for tuberculosis.},

METHOD/DESIGN: This is an interpretative phenomenological study conducted from in-depth interviews to analyse how health professionals understand their personal experience of tuberculosis. SCENARIO: Two reference health institutions for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment located in a municipality of the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. PARTICIPANTS: Intentional sample of 15 health professionals with the disease or with a recent history of tuberculosis. RESULTS: Regarding the personal experience of tuberculosis of the participating health professionals, four superordinate themes were identified: (1) experiencing tuberculosis, (2) experiencing the diagnosis of tuberculosis, (3) facing the treatment of tuberculosis and (4) signifying tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: This study verified that health professionals live the experience of tuberculosis similar to other people: with fear, anguish, frustration, prejudice and health needs not always met by the services and programmes for the control of the disease. The lived experience has an important impact on the health professionals' ways of understanding the kind of empathic and sensitive care that should be provided to people with tuberculosis. In addition, it is concluded that specific governmental strategies are needed for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment among health professionals.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of HIV positive patients who were diagnosed as uveitis due to NTM. RESULTS: Six eyes of four HIV positive patients with NTM were studied. Average age at presentation was 35.5 years (range 30-38). With specific PCR primers, Mycobacterium avium was detected in three patients (75{\%}) and Mycobacterium fortuitum in one patient (25{\%}). Culture was positive in two cases. Two eyes (33.33{\%}) each had endophthalmitis and necrotizing retinitis like picture, one eye (16.66{\%}) each had chorioretinitis and frosted branch angitis like. Visual acuity improved in two eyes (33.33{\%}), worsened in three eyes (50{\%}), and remained unchanged in one eye (16.6{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: NTM infection is a unique entity in immunosuppressed with poor visual outcome. PCR forms a useful tool for rapid diagnosis and timely initiation of specific anti-tuberculosis therapy.},

In this study, we analysed the genome and proteome of Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699 and identified 1102 transcription factors which comprise about 10{\%} of the total genome. Using interactomics approaches we delineated 30 unique transcription factors directly involved in secondary metabolism that regulate rifamycin B biosynthesis. We also predict the role of RifN as hub in controlling the regulation of other genes involved in rifamycin biosynthesis. RifN is important for maintaining the integrity of the rifamycin-network. Thus, these transcription factor can be exploited to improve rifamycin B production in Amycolatopsis mediterranei S699.},

abstract = {Bacterial membrane proteins of the SbmA/BacA family are multi-solute transporters that mediate the uptake of structurally diverse hydrophilic molecules, including aminoglycoside antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Some family members are full-length ABC transporters, whereas other members are truncated homologues that lack the nucleotide-binding domains and thus mediate ATP-independent transport. A recent cryo-EM structure of the ABC transporter Rv1819c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has shed light on the structural basis for multi-solute transport and has provided insight into the mechanisms of transport. Here, we discuss how the protein architecture makes SbmA/BacA-family transporters prone to inadvertent import of antibiotics, and speculate on the question which physiological processes may benefit from multi-solute transport.},

abstract = {Increasing numbers of head and neck cancer patients are placed on immune checkpoint inhibitors for indications such as recurrent and metastatic disease. There is a theoretical increased risk of contracting and reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) with programmed cell death-1 blockade due to potentiation of type 1 T helper response and increased production of interferon-gamma. This is a potentially life-threatening complication of therapy and requires expedient diagnosis and treatment. We present a case of a patient with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with avelumab, a programmed cell death-ligand 1 inhibitor with resulting laryngeal TB as the presenting symptom of reactivated TB. The patient required quadruple anti-TB therapy, but developed ongoing sequelae of laryngeal TB, including dysphagia and laryngeal stenosis. Ongoing trials are examining the use of avelumab in head and neck cancer patients with locally advanced disease, recurrent, or metastatic disease. Awareness of the risk of new and reactivated TB is crucial.},

In unadjusted difference-in-difference logistic regression analyses (n = 148), Muslim patients had lower treatment completion rates than non-Muslim patients during Ramadan prior to program implementation (68.8{\%} vs 95.4{\%}), whereas rates were comparable postimplementation (95.7{\%} vs 96.4{\%}; difference-in-difference P = .011). Similar results were found after adjusting for age and gender (pre: 71.4{\%} vs 94.8{\%}; post: 95.5{\%} vs 96.3{\%}; P = .032).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In human blood, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are abundant T cells that recognize antigens presented on non-polymorphic major histocompatibility complex-related 1 (MR1) molecules. The MAIT cells are activated by mycobacteria, and prior human studies indicate that blood frequencies of MAIT cells, defined by cell surface markers, decline during tuberculosis (TB) disease, consistent with redistribution to the lungs. METHODS: We tested whether frequencies of blood MAIT cells were altered in patients with TB disease relative to healthy Mycobacterium tuberculosis-exposed controls from Peru and South Africa. We quantified their frequencies using MR1 tetramers loaded with 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil. RESULTS: Unlike findings from prior studies, frequencies of blood MAIT cells were similar among patients with TB disease and latent and uninfected controls. In both cohorts, frequencies of MAIT cells defined by MR1-tetramer staining and coexpression of CD161 and the T-cell receptor alpha variable gene TRAV1-2 were strongly correlated. Disease severity captured by body mass index or TB disease transcriptional signatures did not correlate with MAIT cell frequencies in patients with TB. CONCLUSIONS: Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related 1-restrictied MAIT cells are detected at similar levels with tetramers or surface markers. Unlike MHC-restricted T cells, blood frequencies of MAIT cells are poor correlates of TB disease but may play a role in pathophysiology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although exhaustive efforts to prevent and treat tuberculosis (TB) was taken the problem still continues due to multi-drug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). It clearly highlights the urgent need to develop novel "druggable" molecules for the co-infection treatment and strains of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: In this approach a hybrid molecule was created by merging two or more pharmacophores. Active site of targets may be addressed by each of the pharmacophores and proffers the opportunity for selectivity. In addition, it also reduced the undesirable side effects and drug-resistant. METHODS: In this study, a novel quinazolinone analog was designed and synthesized by substituting thiourea nucleus and phenyl ring at N-3 and C-2 position of quinazoline ring respectively. All title compounds were tested for antitubercular activity by in-vitro M. tuberculosis and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity by MT-4 cell assay method. The agar dilution method was used to test the antibacterial potency of entire prepared derivatives against various strains of gram positive and gram-negative microorganism. RESULTS: The title compounds, 1-(substituted)-2-methyl-3-(4-oxo-2-phenyl quinazolin-3(4H)-yl) isothioureas (QTS1 - QTS15) are synthesized by reaction between key intermediate 3-amino-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one with various alkyl/aryl isothiocyanates followed by methylation with dimethyl sulphate. Among the series, compound 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-methyl-3-(4-oxo-2-phenyl quinazolin- 3(4H)-yl) isothioureas (QTS14) shown highest potency against B. subtilis, K. pneumonia and S. aureus at 1.6 µg/mL. The compound QTS14 exhibited the most potent antitubercular activity at with the MIC of 0.78 µg/mL and anti-HIV activity at 0.97µg/mL against HIV1 and HIV2. CONCLUSION: The results obtained from this study confirm that the synthesized and biologically evaluated quinazolines showed promising antimicrobial, antitubercular and anti-HIV activities. The new scaffolds for proffers plausible lead for further development and optimization to novel antitubercular and anti-HIV drugs.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a successful pathogen in the history of mankind. A high rate of mortality and morbidity raises the need for vaccine development. Mechanism of pathogenesis, survival strategy and virulence determinant are needed to be explored well for this pathogen. The involvement of DNA binding proteins in the regulation of virulence genes, transcription, DNA replication, repair make them more significant. In present work, we have identified 1453 DNA binding proteins (DBPs) in the 4173 genes of Mtb through the DNABIND tool and they were subjected for further screening by incorporating different bioinformatics tools. The eighteen DBPs were selected for the B-cell epitope prediction by using ABCpred server. Moreover, the B-cell epitope bearing the antigenic and non- allergenic property were selected for T-cell epitope prediction using ProPredI, and ProPred server. Finally, DGIGSAVSV (Rv1088), IRALPSSRH (Rv3923c), LTISPIANS (Rv3235), VQPSGKGGL (Rv2871) VPRPGPRPG (Rv2731) and VGQKINPHG (Rv0707) were identified as T-cell epitopes. The structural modelling of these epitopes and DBPs was performed to ensure the localization of these epitopes on the respective proteins. The interaction studies of these epitopes with human HLA confirmed their validation to be used as potential vaccine candidates. Collectively, these results revealed that the DBPs- Rv2731, Rv3235, Rv1088, Rv0707, Rv3923c and Rv2871 are the most appropriate vaccine candidates. In our knowledge, it is the first report of using the DBPs of Mtb for epitope prediction. Significantly, this study also provides evidence to be useful for designing a peptide-based vaccine against tuberculosis.},

Unfortunately, the lack of/ample lethargic towards the development of compelling anti-TB regimens with a large-scale prevalence rate is a great challenge towards control of the pandemic situation. Indeed, the recent improvement in genomic studies for early diagnosis and understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance, as well as the identification of newer drug targets is quite remarkable and promising. Mainly, identification of such genetic factors, chromosomal mutations and associated pathways gives new ray of hope in current anti-TB drug discovery. This focused review provides molecular insights into the updated drug resistance mechanisms with encoded bacilli genetic factors as a novel target and potential source of development with screened-out newer anti-TB agents towards the control of MDR-TB soon.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing literature on the association of SARS-CoV-2 and other chronic conditions, such as noncommunicable diseases. However, little is known about the impact of coinfection with tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the risk of death and recovery, as well as time-to-death and time-to-recovery, in COVID-19 patients with and without tuberculosis. METHODS: We created a 4:1 propensity score matched sample of COVID-19 patients without and with tuberculosis, using COVID-19 surveillance data in the Philippines. We conducted a longitudinal cohort analysis of matched COVID-19 patients as of May 17, 2020, following them until June 15, 2020. The primary analysis estimated the risk ratios of death and recovery in patients with and without tuberculosis. Kaplan-Meier curves described time-to-death and time-to-recovery stratified by tuberculosis status, and differences in survival were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The risk of death in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 2.17 times higher than in those without (95{\%} CI: 1.40-3.37). The risk of recovery in COVID-19 patients with tuberculosis was 25{\%} lower than in those without (RR = 0.75,05{\%} CI 0.63-0.91). Similarly, time-to-death was significantly shorter (p = .0031) and time-to-recovery significantly longer in patients with tuberculosis (p = .0046). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that coinfection with tuberculosis increased morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Our findings highlight the need to prioritize routine and testing services for tuberculosis, although health systems are disrupted by the heavy burden of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.},

M. bovis is a persistent pathogen that causes zoonotic tuberculosis and can infect both animals and human beings. The detection of M. bovis in milk samples is critical for effective control and prevention of zoonotic diseases but there lacks effective and sensitive methods. Here, we developed a convenient and low-cost system for M. bovis detection in milk, which incorporated automated DNA extraction and dLAMP by interfacial emulsification technique. Versus real-time PCR, dLAMP provides higher accuracy and sensitivity for direct M. bovis detection in milk, offering a limit of detection of 14 CFU/mL within 2 h. The dLAMP system can become a powerful platform for the detection of pathogens in complex samples and provide more reliable guidance for food safety testing, epidemiological research and clinical diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Delayed treatment initiation of Tuberculosis patients results in increased infectivity, poor treatment outcome, and increased mortality. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the delay in new adult pulmonary Tuberculosis patients to initiate treatment in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the factors associated with treatment initiation delay among new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. METHODS: The study design was cross-sectional. A total of 875 new adult pulmonary tuberculosis patients were recruited from 21 health facilities from October 2018 to October 2019. Health facilities were selected by simple random sampling technique and tuberculosis cases from the health facilities were consecutively enrolled. Data were collected using structured questionnaire within the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation. Delay was categorized as patient, health system and total delays. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the odds of delays to initiate treatment. A p-value of less than 0.05 was reported as statistically significant. RESULTS: The median patient, health system and total delays were 30, 18 and 62 days, respectively. Rural residence, being poor, visiting non-formal medication sources, being primary health care and the private clinic had higher odds of patient delay whereas being HIV positive had lower odds of patient delay. Illiteracy, first visit to primary health care and private clinic had higher odds of health system delay whereas a visit to health facility one time and have no patient delay had lower odds of health system delay. CONCLUSION: The median patient delay was higher than the median health system delay before initiating treatment. Hence, improved awareness of the community and involving the informal medication sources in the tuberculosis pathways would reduce patient delay. Similarly, improved cough screening and diagnostic efficiency of the lower health facilities would shorten health system delay.},

abstract = {Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) encoded by MBL2 gene is a protein with the ability to form carbohydrate complexes with microbial wall promoting their subsequent elimination. Genetically determined levels of MBL can modify the risk and clinical characteristics of many infectious diseases. The frequency of MBL2 genotypes exhibits significant population differences. The data on the distribution of MBL2 genotypes among the aborigines of the Russian Arctic territories have not yet been published. A total of 880 specimens of dried blood spots of the newborns were genotyped. The newborns represented four populations: Nenets, Dolgan-Nganasans, Mixed aboriginal population, and Russians (Caucasians, Krasnoyarsk). Six polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene were studied: rs11003125, rs7096206, rs7095891, rs5030737, rs1800450, and rs1800451. The frequency of the combined rare O allele (composed of the coding region variants rs5030737, rs1800450, and rs1800451) in the homozygous state was significantly higher in Russians: 10{\%} vs 2{\%} in Nenets and 1{\%} in Dolgan-Nganosans (p {\textless} 0.001 for Russians vs other populations). The frequency of the high-producing haplotype (HYPA) was 35.4{\%} in the Russian newborns, in keeping with European populations (27-33{\%}); 64{\%} for Nenets and 56{\%} for Dolgan-Nganasans, similar to the estimates obtained for Eskimos and North Amerinds (64-81{\%}). Our study results are in line with the hypothesis that human evolution has been moving in the direction of accumulation of the genotypes associated with low activity of the lectin complement activation pathway because of the prevalence of some intracellular infections such as tuberculosis, whereby low MBL activity may have a protective effect.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine disease profile of tubercular uveitis (TBU) in Paediatric population. METHODS: Among 945 patients of the retrospective multinational study by the Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS)-1, 29 Paediatric patients diagnosed with TBU were analyzed. RESULTS: Mean age of disease presentation was 12.8 (range 4-18 years), with predominance of males (n = 14/20; 70.0{\%}) and Asian ethnicity (n = 25/29; 86.2{\%}). Posterior uveitis (n = 14/28; 50{\%}) was the most frequent uveitis phenotype, with choroidal involvement occurring in 64.7{\%} (n = 11/17). Incidence of optic disc edema and macular edema was higher in children (n = 8/18; 44.4{\%} and n = 5/18; 27.8{\%}, respectively) than in adults (n = 160/942; 16.9{\%} and n = 135/942; 14.3{\%}, respectively). Comparison of optic disc edema between subgroups showed a significant difference (P =.006). All patients received oral corticosteroids, most of them with antitubercular therapy. Treatment failure developed in 4.8{\%} (n = 1/21). CONCLUSIONS: Children have a more severe inflammatory response to the disease, and an intensive anti-inflammatory therapeutic regimen is required to achieve a positive treatment outcome.},

abstract = {Translational frameshift errors are often deleterious to the synthesis of functional proteins and could therefore be promoted therapeutically to kill bacteria. TrmD (tRNA-(N(1)G37) methyltransferase) is an essential tRNA modification enzyme in bacteria that prevents +1 errors in the reading frame during protein translation and represents an attractive potential target for the development of new antibiotics. Here, we describe the application of a structure-guided fragment-based drug discovery approach to the design of a new class of inhibitors against TrmD in Mycobacterium abscessus. Fragment library screening, followed by structure-guided chemical elaboration of hits, led to the rapid development of drug-like molecules with potent in vitro TrmD inhibitory activity. Several of these compounds exhibit activity against planktonic M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis as well as against intracellular M. abscessus and M. leprae, indicating their potential as the basis for a novel class of broad-spectrum mycobacterial drugs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Persistent and relapsing babesiosis caused by Babesia microti often occurs in immunocompromised patients, and has been associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents such as atovaquone. Given the rising incidence of babesiosis in the United States, novel drugs are urgently needed. In the current study, we tested whether clofazimine (CFZ), an antibiotic used to treat leprosy and drug-resistant tuberculosis, is effective against B. microti. METHODS: Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency were infected with 107B. microti-infected erythrocytes. Parasites were detected by means of microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained blood smears or nested polymerase chain reaction. CFZ was administered orally. RESULTS: Uninterrupted monotherapy with CFZ curtailed the rise of parasitemia and achieved radical cure. B. microti parasites and B. microti DNA were cleared by days 10 and 50 of therapy, respectively. A 7-day administration of CFZ delayed the rise of parasitemia by 22 days. This rise was caused by B. microti isolates that did not carry mutations in the cytochrome b gene. Accordingly, a 14-day administration of CFZ was sufficient to resolve high-grade parasitemia caused by atovaquone-resistant B. microti parasites. CONCLUSIONS: Clofazimine is effective against B. microti infection in the immunocompromised host. Additional preclinical studies are required to identify the minimal dose and dosage of CFZ for babesiosis.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is now a standard of care in oncology. There is a need to improve our knowledge about immune-related adverse events, especially infectious diseases. CASE REPORT: We describe the case of a 49-year old male who received anti-PD1 therapy, to treat metastatic melanoma with pulmonary metastasis. After 3 cycles of nivolumab, computed tomography scanning showed a decrease of the pulmonary metastasis in the upper left lobe, but revealed new pulmonary lesions such as tree-in-bud and a lung cavity in the same lobe. This was diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis with no antibiotic resistance identified. The patient continued the immunotherapy and was initiated onto a standard anti-tuberculosis therapy. In the absence of an initial positive IFN-$\gamma$ release assay (Quantiferon) test, but as there might have been a history of primary infection during childhood, a reactivation of tuberculosis was considered to be likely. CONCLUSIONS: This is the ninth case of tuberculosis infection under immunotherapy and it underlines the need to consider infection risks in patients undergoing immunotherapy. An INF-$\gamma$ release assay screening test should be considered an essential part of the pre-treatment work-up.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To discuss the necessity of anti-tuberculosis therapy after resection of asymptomatic pulmonary tuberculous nodules: is postoperative anti-tuberculosis therapy is over-treatment? METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study. Patients with solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) and diagnosed as tuberculosis by pathology were included. Clinical features are collected. The primary end point is tuberculosis relapse and the secondary is adverse drug reactions. Patients are divided into two groups according to the acceptance of anti-tuberculosis treatment after operation (A: treated; B: untreated). Recurrence is diagnosed by multi-disciplinary discussion. The difference of recurrence rate will be compared and the incidence of adverse drug reactions in Group A will be calculated. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were enrolled, 66 in Group A and 32 in Group B. No significant difference between two groups was found in the past history of tuberculosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), T-spot positive rate, and the uptake value of 18F-glucose. No relapse of tuberculosis was found in both groups. The incidence of adverse drug reactions in Group A was 61{\%} (40/66), and the rate of severe adverse reaction was 14{\%} (9/66). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative recurrence of tuberculosis is rare, anti-tuberculosis treatment seems unnecessary for asymptomatic pulmonary tuberculous nodules. Adverse drug reactions should not be ignored.},

The control group (placebo + TB/DM) included 174 patients who received anti-TB therapy and enteric-coated placebo tablets (an identical tablet containing no drug). Eighty-two patients in the aspirin group and 86 in the control group completed the trial and were included in the analysis. Clinical characteristics, laboratory test results, imaging data and side effects of aspirin were monitored.Results: Aspirin treatment affect certain signs and symptoms. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were lower in the aspirin group than in the control group after treatment (Both p = .000). The sputum-negative conversion rate was 86.7{\%} in the aspirin group, significantly higher than in the control group (53.8{\%}) (p = .031). After two months of treatment, the differences in the number of cases with cavities, the number of cavities, and maximum diameter of cavities in the aspirin group were statistically significant (p = .003, p = .023 and p = .015 respectively).Conclusion: Our findings suggest that aspirin may improve treatment in patients with pulmonary TB and type 2 DM.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite pneumonia being an emerging burden on Parkinson's disease patients, there is essentially nothing known on whether they are at an increased risk of pneumonia occurrence and their associated factors. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether Parkinson's disease is associated with the risk of pneumonia and its associated factors. METHODS: Using nationwide database that covers the whole population in South Korea from 2002 to 2017, we identified newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients in 2004-2006, and selected four age- and sex-matched controls for each patient from the general population. From these patients and controls, we identified pneumonia occurrence until the end of the study period, and plotted Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards model to determine its risk. RESULTS: We identified 10,159 Parkinson's disease patients and matched 39,574 controls. These patients showed a higher incidence rate than controls (11.21 vs. 3.61 events/1000 person-years) throughout the study period, and were at an increased risk of pneumonia (hazard ratio = 2.26; 95{\%} CI, 2.17-2.36) even after adjusting for confounders. Old age, male sex, region of residence, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, tuberculosis, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure disorder and antidiabetic drug usage were all associated with a higher risk of pneumonia, while dyslipidemia and antihypertensive medication usage lowered the risk. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease patients may be more likely to experience pneumonia compared to the general population throughout the disease course from diagnosis. Therefore, physicians should focus on the modifiable risk factors of pneumonia in such patients.},

Evidence suggests that the toll-like receptor 2, 4 (TLR2, TLR4) and toll interacting protein (TOLLIP) may be associated with TB susceptibility. In this self-validated study, we explored the association between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TLR2, TLR4 and TOLLIP in the Chinese Han and Tibetan populations. A SNPscan™ method was used to genotype SNPs in the three genes. Multiple logistic regression adjusted by sex and age was used to detect the association between SNPs and TB. In TLR2, rs1898830 was associated with decreased risk against TB in the Chinese Han population, which was validated in the Tibetan population. In TLR4, rs11536889 was a protective factor for TB in the Tibetan population, but not in the Han population. Additionally, in the Tibetan population, we also found that the frequency of genotypes of TOLLIP rs11536889 differs significantly between TB patients and controls. We found rs1898830 in TLR2 was associated with TB susceptibility in both Chinese Han and Tibetan populations while rs11536889 in TLR4 and rs3750920 in TOLLIP were protective factors against TB in the Tibetan population.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex infectious disease caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) which has coexisted with humanity since the Neolithic. Recent research indicated that SIRT3 plays a pivotal role in promoting the antimycobacterial response of mitochondria and autophagy during Mtb infection. A case-control study comprised 900 TB patients and 1534 healthy controls who were retrospectively enrolled to assess the association between Sirt3 gene polymorphisms and TB susceptibility. In total, five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs511744, rs3782118, rs7104764, rs536715 and rs28365927) were selected through database 1000 Genomes Project and offline software Haploview V4.2 and genotyped by a customized 2 × 48-Plex SNPscan™ Kit. Our results suggested that the minor allele genotypes (A carriers) of rs3782118 confers the decreased risk of TB susceptibility (p(Bonferroni) = 0.032), and a similar but more significant effect was observed under the dominant model analysis (OR 0.787, 95{\%} CI 0.666-0.931, p(Bonferroni) = 0.026). Haplotype analysis showed that haplotype AGAAG (rs511744/rs3782118/rs7104764/rs536715/rs28365927) was associated with an increased risk of TB (p = 0.023, OR 1.159, 95{\%} CI 1.019-1.317). In stratification analysis, we found that rs3782118 was associated with decreased risk of TB in female subgroup under the dominant model analysis (p(Bonferroni) = 0.016, OR 0.678, 95{\%} CI 0.523-0.878). Moreover, functional annotations for three loci (rs7930823, rs3782116 and rs3782115) which are strongly linked to rs3782118 indicated that they may be responsible for the changes in some motifs. In conclusion, our study suggested that the SNP rs3782118 was associated with a lower susceptibility to TB, especially under the dominant model analysis and that the haplotype AGAAG (containing the major allele G of rs3782118) was associated with an increased risk of TB. Further independent cohort studies are necessary to validate the protective effect of Sirt3 genetic variants on the risk of TB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Control of the tuberculosis (TB) pandemic remains hindered, in part, by a lack of simple and accurate measures of treatment efficacy. Current gold standard markers rely on sputum-based assays that are slow and challenging to implement. Previous work identified urinary N1, N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm), neopterin, hydroxykynurenine, N-acetylhexosamine, ureidopropionic acid, sialic acid, and m/z 241.0903 as potential biomarkers of active pulmonary TB (ATB). Here, we evaluated their ability to serve as biomarkers of TB treatment response and mycobacterial load. METHODS: We analyzed urine samples prospectively collected from two cohorts with ATB: 34 participants from African countries treated with first line TB therapy (HRZE) and followed for one year, and 35 participants from Haiti treated with either HRZE or an experimental drug followed for 14 days. Blinded samples were analyzed by untargeted high-performance liquid chromatography-coupled-time of flight-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Urinary levels of all seven molecules exhibited significant decreases by week 26 of successful treatment (p=0.01-p{\textless}0.0001), and positive correlations with sputum mycobacterial load (p{\textless}0.0001). Urinary levels of DiAcSpm exhibited significant decreases in participants treated with HRZE as early as 14 days (p{\textless}0.0001) but were unchanged in participants receiving ineffective therapy (p=0.14). CONCLUSION: Reductions in urinary DiAcSpm, neopterin, hydroxykynurenine, N-acetylhexosamine, ureidopropionic acid, sialic acid, and m/z 241.0903 correlated with successful anti-TB treatment and sputum mycobacterial load. Levels of DiAcSpm exhibited reductions capable of differentiating treatment success from failure as early as two weeks after the initiation of chemotherapy, commending its further development as a potentially simple, non-invasive biomarker of treatment response and bacterial load.

abstract = {Mycobacterium is known for subverting the host defense machinery, and one such mechanism is the inhibition of autophagy. Here, we have demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) secretes a virulence factor; an early secretory antigenic target protein (ESAT-6) into the phagosome, which induces the expression and activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD-2) of macrophages. Using a series of experiments, and Mycobacterium bovis BCG as a model strain (where ESAT-6 protein is not expressed), we have delineated that the protein regulates SOD-2 of macrophages. The expression and augmentation of SOD-2 activity were confirmed by either incubating the macrophages with ESAT-6 protein, transfection of macrophage by esat6 gene using a eukaryotic promoter vector, or by infection with different mycobacterial strains. The induction of acidification of phagosomal compartment containing bacteria was observed in cells that express low levels of SOD-2. This was further confirmed by observing a significant decrease in the M. bovis BCG intracellular load in the sod-2 knocked-down macrophages.},

abstract = {The religious mass gathering and bathing can pose a multitude of significant public health challenges and lead to severe alterations in the river microbial ecology. The Pandharpur Wari is an annual pilgrimage of Maharashtra, India, where millions of devotees carry the footprints of the saint-poets and pay their obeisance to Lord Vitthal on the 11th day of moon's waxing phase (Ashadi Ekadashi). As a part of the ritual, the engrossed devotees, walk over 250 km, take a first holy dip in a sacred river Indrayani at Alandi and secondly in Bhima River at Pandharpur. The MinION-based shotgun metagenomic approach was employed to examine the impact of spiritual mass bathing on environmental changes (concerning the river microbial community structure and functions); and public health aspects (in terms of changes in the pathogenic potential and antibiotic resistance). The analysis of bathing and post-bathing samples of both the rivers revealed alterations in the alpha and beta diversity, indicating significant spatiotemporal variations in the overall microbial structure and function. Furthermore, the analysis revealed up to 80{\%} of differences in the abundance of virulence genes between the bathing and post bathing samples. We observed parallel increase of priority skin and enteric pathogens (ranging from 11{\%} to 80{\%}) such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa during the bathing event. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the antibiotic resistance in the bathing samples of Bhima and Indrayani rivers respectively. Altogether, this is the first comprehensive metagenomic study unravelling the influence of religious mass-bathing on the riverine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The recalcitrance of pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis, to eradication is due to various factors allowing bacteria to escape from stress situations. The mycobacterial chaperone GroEL1, overproduced after macrophage entry and under oxidative stress, could be one of these key players. We previously reported that GroEL1 is necessary for the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate, a virulence-associated lipid and for reducing antibiotic susceptibility. In the present study, we showed that GroEL1, bearing a unique C-terminal histidine-rich region, is required for copper tolerance during Mycobacterium bovis BCG biofilm growth. Mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that GroEL1 displays high affinity for copper ions, especially at its C-terminal histidine-rich region. Furthermore, the binding of copper protects GroEL1 from destabilization and increases GroEL1 ATPase activity. Altogether, these findings suggest that GroEL1 could counteract copper toxicity, notably in the macrophage phagosome, and further emphasizes that M. tuberculosis GroEL1 could be an interesting antitubercular target.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Anti-tuberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH) is a serious adverse drug reaction, and its pathogenic mechanism is still largely unknown. Pregnane X receptor (PXR, encoded by the NR1I2 gene) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, and rifampicin is a human PXR-specific activator. Rifampicin and isoniazid co-therapy targets porphyrin biosynthesis via PXR and results in hepatic protoporphyrin IX accumulation and subsequent liver injury. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between genetic polymorphisms in NR1I2 and ATDH in an Eastern Chinese Han population. METHODS: A 1:4 matched case-control study was conducted using 146 ATDH cases and 584 controls. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected and analysed. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between genotypes and risk of ATDH by the odds ratios (ORs) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs), with liver disease history, hepatoprotectant use, smoking history and drinking history as covariates. RESULTS: Patients carrying the GG genotype of rs7643645 were at a higher risk of ATDH than those carrying the AA genotype (OR = 1.864, 95{\%} CI: 1.106-3.141, P = .020), and significant differences were also found under the recessive model (P = .029) and additive model (P = .021). Patients with a polymorphism at rs2276707 were at a reduced risk of ATDH under the recessive model (OR = 0.600, 95{\%} CI: 0.364-0.988, P = .045). Subgroup analysis confirmed the relationship in mild hepatotoxicity cases under the additive model (rs7643645, OR = 1.429, 95{\%} CI: 1.027-1.988, P = .034) and recessive model (rs2276707, OR = 0.478, 95{\%} CI: 0.253-0.902, P = .023). Functional annotation using ENCODE data also indicated that rs2276707 and rs7643645 were located in the histone modification regions targeting enhancers or promoter (H3K4Me1, H3K4Me3 and H3K27Ac). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this case-control study, SNPs rs7643645 and rs2276707 in NR1I2 may contribute to susceptibility to ATDH in Eastern Chinese Han anti-TB treatment patients. Further studies in larger varied populations are needed to validate our findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine whether increased cut-off of the T-SPOT.TB could aid in diagnosing active tuberculosis (ATB). METHODS: Patients suspected of having TB were enrolled to derive a T-SPOT.TB threshold value to help diagnose ATB, which was subsequently validated in real-world clinical practice. RESULTS: In total, 701 adult patients suspected of having tuberculosis who had undergone the T-SPOT.TB assay were included in the derivation cohort. The numbers of ESAT-6 (U = 43583, P = 0.0002) and CFP-10 (U = 41753, P {\textless} 0.0001) spot-forming cells (SFCs) significantly increased in the ATB group compared with the Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) group. According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, when a cut-off of 37.5 SFCs/2.5 × 10(5) cells was used to discriminate between ATB and LTBI, the sensitivity was 57.5{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 50.7{\%}-64.2{\%}) and the specificity was 59.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 55.2{\%}-64.2{\%}). A threshold value of 173.5 SFCs/2.5 × 10(5) could be used to obtain a specificity of {\textless}90{\%} to discriminate between ATB and LTBI. The diagnostic accuracy of higher T-SPOT.TB threshold values in the validation cohort was similar to that in the derivation cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In high-burden countries, a higher threshold value of 173.5 SFCs/2.5 × 10(5) may aid in ATB diagnosis in suspected tuberculosis patients.},

abstract = {Avian leucosis (AL) is a disease characterized by tumors and is caused by the avian leukosis virus (ALV). Because of the high variability of viruses and complex pathogenic mechanisms, screening and breeding J subgroup of ALV (ALV-J) resistant avian breeds is one of the strategies for prevention and treatment of AL, thus screening of significant immune markers is needed to promote the development of disease-resistant breeds. In this study, data-independent acquisition (DIA) technology was used to detected the DEPs of three breeds of chicken according different comparsion to investigate the potential markers. Results showed special DEPs for spleen development of each breeds were detected, such as PCNT, DDB2 and ZNF62. These DEPs were involved in intestinal immune network used in production of IgA signaling pathways and related to immune response which can be used as potential markers for spleen development in different breeds. The DEPs such as RAB44 and TPN involved in viral myocarditis, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and tuberculosis can be used as potential markers of spleen immune response after ALV-J infection in chickens. Pair-wise analysis was performed for the three breeds after the infection of ALV-J. The peoteins such as RFX1, TAF10 and VH1 were differently expressed between three breeds. These DEPs involved in antigen processing and expression, acute myelogenous leukemia and viral carcinogenesis can be used as potential immune markers after ALV-J infection of different genetic backgrounds. The screening of potential markers at protein level provides a strong theoretical research basis for disease resistance breeding in poultry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Left-sided portal hypertension (LSPH) is an extremely rare clinical syndrome, and it is the only form of curable portal hypertension. It is primarily caused by pancreatic disease, and is associated with complications that cause spleen vein compression. Specific symptoms are often lacking, rendering it difficult to diagnose. Splenectomy is the main treatment for cases complicated by variceal bleeding, and the effects of treatment primarily depend on the condition of the primary disease. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 29-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital for repeated hematemesis and black stool. She had been misdiagnosed with pancreatic cancer 7 years prior. Combined imaging and endoscopic examination indicated varicose gastric fundus veins, a pancreatic mass, and enlarged peripancreatic lymph nodes. Laboratory investigations revealed reduced erythrocyte, platelet, and leukocyte counts, the interferon gamma release assay was positive, and liver function was normal. Abdominal exploration, splenectomy, varicose vein dissection, and lesion resection were performed via laparotomy. Postoperative biopsy analysis confirmed the diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis. Based on the above-described factors, LSPH caused by peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis was a diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: Herein we describe the first reported case of LSPH caused by peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis. When left portal hypertension occurs simultaneously, peripancreatic lymph node tuberculosis is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer. Further studies are necessary to develop a more favorable diagnostic method for pancreas masses and more advantageous therapy for LSPH, especially in cases caused by mechanical compression.},

Here, we report a TB outbreak in a high school in southern China, which was confirmed and characterized by traditional epidemiological methods and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. All students and faculty (n = 287) were screened by chest X-ray for active TB. TB was diagnosed in 28 patients, according to laboratory confirmation (n = 11) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, sputum/bronchoalveolar fluid culture, smear, or TB-Xpert. Clinically diagnosed TB cases (n = 17) were further defined by the interferon-$\gamma$ releasing assay or clinical and radiological findings. Twenty-five of the affected individuals were 12th grade students aged 16 to 19 years; among them, 24 patients were male and 21 had visited the internet caf{\'{e}} near the school. WGS and phylogenetics analysis confirmed that the outbreak was mainly caused by a super transmission strain of lineage 4.2, which was susceptible to all tested antibiotics. After a treatment regimen of 9 to12 months, all 28 patients were cured. This study highlights the key factors contributing to school-clustered TB outbreaks mainly derived from a single super transmission strain, along with effective interventional measures to prevent a larger scale outbreak.},

abstract = {Dental health care workers are in close contact to their patients and are therefore at higher risk for contracting airborne infectious diseases. The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. With the outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as seasonal influenza, occasional outbreaks of measles and tuberculosis, and the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease COVID-19, it is important to estimate the risks for dental health care workers. Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. This equation incorporated the indoor air quality by using carbon dioxide as a proxy and added the respiratory protection rate from medical face masks and N95 respirators. Scenario-specific analyses, uncertainty analyses, and sensitivity analyses were run to produce probability rates. A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100{\%}), coronaviruses (99.4{\%}), influenza virus (89.4{\%}), and M. tuberculosis (84.0{\%}). The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5{\%} for measles virus and 0{\%} for the other pathogens. From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. The risk magnitude, however, is highly dependent on specific conditions in each dental clinic. Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.},

abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are known to be closely involved in various diseases progression. Nevertheless, their function and underlying mechanisms in tuberculosis (TB) remain largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore their potential diagnostic values in TB. We downloaded the gene expression datasets of circRNA (GSE117563 and GSE106953), microRNA (miRNA, dataset GSE29190) and mRNA (GSE54992) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network was constructed based on circRNA-miRNA-mRNA potential interaction. We also constructed a circRNA-miRNA-hub gene regulatory module by using the Cytohubba. Gene ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to predict their biological functions. By further validation, the expression level of hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883 and hsa-miR-409-5p were detected by qRT-PCR in 20 active TB patients and 20 healthy donors. Then, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic values of hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883. 1 differentially expressed circRNA (DE-circRNA), 1 differentially expressed miRNA (DE-miRNA), and 44 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) were selected for the construction of ceRNA network in TB. A circRNA-miRNA-hub gene (mRNA) sub-network was constructed based on 1 DE-circRNA, 1 DE-miRNA, and 8 DE-mRNAs. Hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883/hsa-miR-409-5p/mRNA interactions may provide some novel mechanisms for active TB. GO and KEGG pathway analysis indicated the possible function of hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883 with TB. ROC analysis revealed that hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883 had potential value for TB diagnosis. Hsa{\_}circ{\_}0028883 is a potentially reliable biomarker to diagnose active TB, but there remains a need to further study the mechanism in TB.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and technical characteristics of anterior-only and posterior-only approach surgeries for the treatment of consecutive multisegment thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis. METHODS: Thirty-five patients who developed consecutive multisegment thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis from September 2012 to May 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Group A was the posterior-only surgery group, and group B was the anterior-only surgery group. The data on the surgery, deformity correction, functional scores, and complications were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the operation time or blood loss between groups A and B (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The preoperative average Cobb angle of kyphosis in groups A and B were 36.2 ± 15.2° and 27.9 ± 7.7°, respectively, which significantly decreased to 4.9 ± 11.8° and 10.4 ± 5.6° after the operation, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05). At the final follow-up, the angles were 7.1 ± 10.5° and 14.6 ± 8.0°. The correction angle and correction rate in group A (31.3 ± 16.6°, 88.6 ± 43.6{\%}) were greater than those in group B (17.5 ± 4.4°, 64.9 ± 14.0{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant difference in the loss angle between groups A and B (P {\textgreater} 0.05), but the loss rate in group B (24.0 ± 27.8{\%}) was higher than that in group A (9.6 ± 10.2{\%}) (P {\textless} 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups (P {\textgreater} 0.05). CONCLUSION: The posterior-only and anterior-only approaches can lead to satisfactory clinical results in the treatment of patients with consecutive multisegment thoracic and lumbar tuberculosis. With posterior-only surgery, kyphosis can be better corrected, and the correction can be better maintained than with anterior-only surgery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to summarize the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathological features of IgG4-realated hypertrophic pachymeningitis (IgG4-RHP) and its differential diagnosis from similar diseases. METHODS: Data of IgG4-RHP patients admitted to Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Infection, the First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University from January 1, 2015 to July 31, 2019 were collected and their clinical symptoms, laboratory examinations, imaging and pathological features were investigated. At the same time, the clinicopathological and imaging findings of other dura thickening diseases diagnosed in our hospital were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical symptoms of 4 IgG4-RHP patients include chronic headache and cranial nerves injury, etc. Levels of serum IgG4 and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IgG4 increased in all patients. Focal enhancement of dura mater could be seen on plain and enhanced cranial MRI. Pathological results were consistent with IgG4-RHP symptoms. Among other diseases that cause dural thickening, the content of serum C-reactive protein in patients with Rosai-Dorfman disease declined. Patients with intracranial hypotension syndrome often have postural headache. Patients with tuberculous meningitis can have previous pulmonary tuberculosis. The diagnosis of patients with atypical meningioma depends on the results of operation and pathology. Patients with central nervous system leukemia can be diagnosed with reference to the results of laboratory results. CONCLUSIONS: The clinicopathological and imaging manifestations of IgG4-RHP are summarized in this study. Meanwhile, the clinical data of several other diseases with similar imaging characteristics are analyzed in order to clarify the diagnostic strategy of IgG4-RHP and provide help for the next treatment.},

Accurate and early detection of infectious pathogens are crucial for transmission control, clinical diagnosis, and therapy. For a traditional reason, most immunological and microbiological laboratories are equipped with instruments designated for antibody-based assays in detection of infectious pathogens or clinical diagnosis. Emerging aptamer-based technologies have pushed a shift from antibody-based to aptamer-based assays due to equal specificity, even better sensitivity, lower manufacturing cost and more flexibility in amending for chemiluminescent, electrochemical or fluorescent detection in a multifaceted and high throughput fashion in comparison of aptamer-based to antibody-based assays. The nature of aptamer-based technologies is particularly suitable for point-of-care testing in remote areas at warm or hot atmosphere, and mass screening for potential infection in pandemic of emerging infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in an epicentre or other regions. This review intends to summarize currently available aptamer-based technologies in detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens for research and clinical application. It is anticipated that potential technologies will be further optimized and validated for clinical translation in meeting increasing demands for prompt, precise, and reliable detection of specific pathogens in various atmospheric conditions.},

In this review, we focused on the mechanism of coronavirus with comorbidities and impairment in multi-organ function. The main dysfunction upon coronavirus infection is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. It is associated with the other organ damage such as cardiovascular risk via an increased level of hypertension through ACE2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risks such as chemosis, conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia, cancer risk, venous thromboembolism, tuberculosis, aging, and cardiovascular dysfunction and reproductive risk. Along with this, we have discussed the immunopathology and coronaviruses at a molecular level and therapeutic approaches for the coronavirus infection. The comorbidities and multi-organ failure of COVID-19 have been explained at a molecular level along with the base of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This review would help us to understand the comorbidities associated with the coronaviruses with multi-organ damage.},
