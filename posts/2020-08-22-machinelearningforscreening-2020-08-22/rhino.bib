abstract = {Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, surveillance activities have been accelerated globally to monitor the emergence of novel reassortant viruses. However, the mechanism by which influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) acquire novel gene constellations through reassortment events in natural settings remains poorly understood. To explore the mechanism, we collected 785 nasal swabs from pigs in a farm in Thailand from 2011 to 2014. H3N2, H3N1, H1N1 and H1N2 IAVs-S were isolated from a single co-infected sample by plaque purification and showed a high degree of diversity of the genome. In particular, the H1N1 isolates, possessing a novel gene constellation previously unreported in Thailand, exhibited greater variation in internal genes than H3N2 IAVs-S. A pair of isolates, designated H3N2-B and H1N1-D, was determined to have been initially introduced to the farm. These results demonstrate that numerous IAVs-S with various gene constellations can be created in a single co-infected pig via reassortment.},

abstract = {Since the first detection of human H3N2 influenza virus in Taiwanese pigs in 1970, infection of pigs with wholly human viruses has been known to occur in other parts of the world. These viruses, referred to as human-like H3N2 viruses, have been known to cause clinical and subclinical infections of swine populations. Due to the paucity and complete unavailability of information on transmission of influenza viruses from other species, especially humans, to swine in Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, this study was designed to investigate the presence and prevalence of a human strain of influenza A (H3N2) in swine populations at three locations in two cities within these two West African countries in January and February, 2014. Using stratified random technique, nasal swab specimens were collected from seventy-five (75) pigs at two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and from fifty (50) pigs in Kumasi, Ghana. These specimens were tested directly by a sensitive Quantitative Solid Phase Antigen-detection Sandwich ELISA using anti-A/Brisbane/10/2007 haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. Influenza virus A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) was detected among pigs at the three study locations, with an aggregate prevalence of 4.0{\%} for the two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and also 4.0{\%} for Kumasi, Ghana. Transmission of influenza viruses from other species to swine portends serious sinister prospects for genetic reassortment and evolvement of novel viruses. We therefore recommend that further studies should be carried out to investigate the presence of other circulating human and avian influenza viruses in swine populations in West Africa and also determine the extent of genetic reassortment of strains circulating among these pigs. This would provide an early warning system for detection of novel influenza viruses, which could have pandemic potentials.},

abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major health concern worldwide as a leading cause of liver-related mortalities and morbidities. Pakistan ranks second among countries with endemic HCV infection; ∼11 million cases are reported so far. HCV burden is continuously rising in Pakistan, mainly because of unsafe blood transfusions, surgical procedures, dental procedures, untrained clinicians, reuse of syringes, barbers, and ear/nose piercing tools. Lack of awareness about HCV transmission routes among the general and high-risk population is a major hurdle in disease management. HCV prevalence in the general population and healthy blood donors ranges from 3.13{\%} to 23.83{\%} and from 1.05{\%} to 20.8{\%}, respectively; whereas in the high-risk groups, HCV prevalence is up to 66{\%}. Genotype 3 is most prevalent in Pakistan followed by genotypes 1 and 2 along with an alarming number of untypable viral genotypes in the local community. Mainly interferon-based antiviral regimens are used in Pakistan and are quite effective, because the major prevalent genotype (genotype 3) showed the best sustained virological response (SVR) with it. But a large number of individuals did not show SVR either because of infection with nonresponder genotypes or because of side effects. Due to these reasons, there was a need for interferon-free direct acting antivirals (DAAs). Recently, Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir: NS5B inhibitor) is approved on a heavy discounted rate for Pakistan; it is currently in effective use and showed good SVR. Sovaldi plus ribavirin is used alone or along with interferon to treat different viral genotypes. Sovaldi will be the future treatment regime for Pakistan, because genotype 2 and genotype 3 infected individuals achieve the best SVR with it. For the treatment of other prevalent viral genotypes, approval of some other DAAs such as Ledipasvir on discounted price is required for better disease management.},

It is now uncommon due to the Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination and is more recently caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae non-type B, H. parainfluenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pasteurella multocida. Very rarely, it can cause necrotising supraglottitis/epiglottitis, and this has been reported in immunocompromised individuals. We present a unique case of multipathogenic supraglottitis causing laryngeal fibrinoid necrosis in an immunocompetent patient. During his admission, the patient was critically unwell and required surgical intervention and tracheostomy. However, he made a full recovery with no persisting morbidity. We believe that this was owed to the aggressive antimicrobial therapy, timely surgical management of the disease process and the patient's immunocompetency.},

It has also been associated with encephalitis recently by detection of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients presented with encephalitis. This retrospective study aimed to present clinical features of HBOV infections in children with respiratory symptoms and describe unexplained encephalopathy in a subgroup of these patients. Results of 1,143 pediatric nasal samples from mid-December 2013 to July 2014 were reviewed for detection of HBOV. A multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction assay was used for viral detection. Medical records of the patients were retrospectively analyzed. HBOV was detected in 30 patients (2.6{\%}). Median age was 14 months (5-80). Clinical diagnoses were upper respiratory tract infection (n=10), bronchopneumonia (n=9), acute bronchiolitis (n=5), pneumonia (n=4), acute bronchitis (n=1), and asthma execarbation (n=1). Hospitalization was required in 16 (53.3{\%}) patients and 10 (62.5{\%}) of them admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Noninvasive mechanical ventilation modalities was applied to four patients and mechanical ventilation to four patients. Intractable seizures developed in four patients while mechanically ventilated on the 2nd-3rd days of PICU admission. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. No mortality was observed, but two patients were discharged with neurological sequela. HBOV may lead to respiratory infections in a wide spectrum of severity. This report indicates its potential to cause severe respiratory infections requiring PICU admission and highlights possible clinical association of HBOV and encephalopathy, which developed during severe respiratory infection.},

Objectives To describe the epidemiology and etiologies of respiratory illnesses among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj. Study design Surveillance for respiratory illness among pilgrims returning to Jordan after the 2014 Hajj was conducted at sentinel health care facilities using epidemiologic surveys and molecular diagnostic testing of upper respiratory specimens for multiple respiratory pathogens, including MERS-CoV. Results Among the 125 subjects, 58{\%} tested positive for at least one virus; 47{\%} tested positive for rhino/enterovirus. No cases of MERS-CoV were detected. Conclusions The majority of pilgrims returning to Jordan from the 2014 Hajj with respiratory illness were determined to have a viral etiology, but none were due to MERS-CoV. A greater understanding of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections among returning travelers to other countries after Hajj should help optimize surveillance systems and inform public health response practices.},

The dynamics of natural infection in camels are not well understood. Through systematic surveillance in Egypt, nasal, rectal, milk, urine and serum samples were collected from camels between June 2014 and February 2016. Locations included quarantines, markets, abattoirs, free-roaming herds and farmed breeding herds. The overall seroprevalence was 71{\%} and RNA detection rate was 15{\%}. Imported camels had higher seroprevalence (90{\%} vs 61{\%}) and higher RT-PCR detection rates (21{\%} vs 12{\%}) than locally raised camels. Juveniles had lower seroprevalence than adults (37{\%} vs 82{\%}) but similar RT-PCR detection rates (16{\%} vs 15{\%}). An outbreak in a breeding herd, showed that antibodies rapidly wane, that camels become re-infected, and that outbreaks in a herd are sustained for an extended time. Maternal antibodies titers were very low in calves regardless of the antibody titers of the mothers. Our results support the hypothesis that camels are a reservoir for MERS-CoV and that camel trade is an important route of introducing the virus into importing countries. Findings related to waning antibodies and re-infection have implications for camel vaccine development, disease management and zoonotic threat.},

abstract = {Early diagnosis of influenza infection maximizes the effectiveness of antiviral medicines. Here, we assess the ability for clinical characteristics and rapid influenza tests to predict PCR-confirmed influenza infection in a sentinel, cross-sectional study for influenza-like illness (ILI) in Thailand. Participants meeting criteria for acute ILI (fever {\textgreater} 38C and cough or sore throat) were recruited from inpatient and outpatient departments in Bangkok, Thailand, from 2009–2014. The primary endpoint for the study was the occurrence of virologically-confirmed influenza infection (based upon detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR) among individuals presenting for care with ILI. Nasal and throat swabs were tested by rapid influenza test (QuickVue) and by RT-PCR. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was calculated using the case test-negative method. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis was used to predict influenza RT-PCR positivity based upon symptoms reported. We enrolled 4572 individuals with ILI; 32.7{\%} had detectable influenza RNA by RT-PCR. Influenza cases were attributable to influenza B (38.6{\%}), A(H1N1)pdm09 (35.1{\%}), and A(H3N2) (26.3{\%}) viruses. VE was highest against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and among adults. The most important symptoms for predicting influenza PCR-positivity among patients with ILI were cough, runny nose, chills, and body aches. The accuracy of the CART predictive model was 72.8{\%}, with an NPV of 78.1{\%} and a PPV of 59.7{\%}. During epidemic periods, PPV improved to 68.5{\%}. The PPV of the QuickVue assay relative to RT-PCR was 93.0{\%} overall, with peak performance during epidemic periods and in the absence of oseltamivir treatment. Clinical criteria demonstrated poor predictive capability outside of epidemic periods while rapid tests were reasonably accurate and may provide an acceptable alternative to RT-PCR testing in resource-limited areas.},

We reviewed the specimens and re-biopsied the tumor, and confirmed that the tumor was positive for CD3, CD56, and EBER1; however, the tumor showed a plasmablastic morphology without necrosis and angiocentricity, and was positive for CD138, but negative for CD20 and PAX5. Given a plasmablastic morphology and EBER1 positivity, but a relatively low Ki67 index (30{\%}), we diagnosed the case as atypical EP. The CHOP regimen was administered and complete remission achieved. This case indicated that EP should be considered as a differential diagnosis even when a tumor shows large cell morphology and is positive for CD3, CD56, and EBER1.},

abstract = {Purpose: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is known to play a role in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and to date, no study has reported on the association between oral HPV infection and HNSCC in the Caribbean. The objective was to determine the prevalence of oral HPV infection in the French West Indies (FWI), overall and by HPV genotype, among HNSCC cases and healthy population controls. Method: We used data from a population-based case–control study conducted in the FWI. The prevalence of oral HPV was estimated separately among 100 HNSCC cases (mean age 59 years) and 308 population controls (mean age 57 years). Odds ratios (OR) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, tobacco, and alcohol consumption, to assess the association between oral HPV infection and HNSCC. Results: Prevalence of oral HPV infections was 26{\%} in controls (30{\%} in men and 14{\%} in women) and 36{\%} in HNSCC cases (36{\%} in men, 33{\%} in women). HPV52 was the most commonly detected genotype, in cases and in controls. The prevalence of HPV16, HPV33, and HPV51 was significantly higher in cases than in controls (p = 0.0340, p = 0.0472, and 0.0144, respectively). Oral infection with high-risk HPV was associated with an increase in risk of HNSCC (OR 1.99, 95{\%} CI 0.95–4.15). HPV16 was only associated with oropharyngeal cancer (OR 16.01, 95{\%} CI 1.67–153.64). Conclusion: This study revealed a high prevalence of oral HPV infection in this middle-aged Afro-Caribbean population, and a specific distribution of HPV genotypes. These findings may provide insight into HNSCC etiology specific to the FWI.},

abstract = {Background: Respiratory symptoms in RSV persist long after the virus is no longer detected by culture. Current concepts of RSV pathogenesis explain this by RSV inducing a long-lasting pathogenic immune cascade. We alternatively hypothesized that prolonged unrecognized RSV replication may be responsible and studied this possibility directly in a human wild-type RSV experimental infection model. Objective: The objective of the current report was to define the duration of true human RSV replication by studying it directly in immunocompetent adults experimentally infected with a clinical strain of RSV utilizing this previously established safe and reproducible model. Study Design: 35 healthy adult volunteers were inoculated with RSV-A (Memphis-37, a low11 passage clinical strain virus, manufactured from a hospitalized bronchiolitic infant) and evaluated over 12 days. Viral load by culture, parallel quantitative PCR (genomic, message) and RSV-specific IgA, were measured twice daily from serially collected nasal washes. Results: After inoculation, 77{\%} (27/35) of volunteers became RSV infected. As expected, culture-detectable RSV ceased abruptly by the 5–6 t h 15 infection day. However, infected volunteers demonstrated prolonged RSV presence by both genomic and message PCR. RSV-specific IgA rose within respiratory secretions of infected volunteers during same time frame. Conclusions: RSV replication appears to continue in humans far longer than previously thought. The rise in nasal RSV-specific IgA shortly after infection likely neutralizes culture detectable virus producing misleadingly short durations of infection. Prolonged viral replication helps explain RSV's extended disease manifestations and increases the potential utility of antivirals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Since the first isolation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012, sporadic cases, clusters, and sometimes large outbreaks have been reported. OBJECTIVE To describe the recent (2015) MERS-CoV outbreak at a large tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. METHODS We conducted an epidemiologic outbreak investigation, including case finding and contact tracing and screening. MERS-CoV cases were categorized as suspected, probable, and confirmed. A confirmed case was defined as positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for MERS-CoV. RESULTS Of the 130 suspected cases, 81 (62{\%}) were confirmed and 49 (38{\%}) were probable. These included 87 patients (67{\%}) and 43 healthcare workers (33{\%}). Older age (mean [SD], 64.4 [18.3] vs 40.1 [11.3] years, P{\textless}.001), symptoms (97{\%} vs 58{\%}, P{\textless}.001), and comorbidity (99{\%} vs 42{\%}, P{\textless}.001) were more common in patients than healthcare workers. Almost all patients (97{\%}) were hospitalized whereas most healthcare workers (72{\%}) were home isolated. Among 96 hospitalized cases, 63 (66{\%}) required intensive care unit management and 60 (63{\%}) required mechanical ventilation. Among all 130 cases, 51 (39{\%}) died; all were patients (51 [59{\%}]) with no deaths among healthcare workers. More than half (54{\%}) of infections were believed to be caught at the emergency department. Strict infection control measures, including isolation and closure of the emergency department, were implemented to interrupt the chain of transmission and end the outbreak. CONCLUSION MERS-CoV remains a major healthcare threat. Early recognition of cases and rapid implementation of infection control measures are necessary.},

abstract = {The respiratory mucosa is the common port of entry of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and several other alphaherpesviruses. An important prerequisite for successful host invasion of the virus is to cross the epithelial cell layer and the underlying basement membrane barrier. In the present study, an analysis was performed to see if an EHV-1 infection of nasal mucosa epithelial cells leads to damage of the underlying extracellular matrix proteins. Nasal mucosa explants were inoculated with EHV-1 and collected at 0, 24 and 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). Then, double immunofluorescence staining was performed to detect viral-antigen-positive cells on the one hand and integrin alpha 6, laminin, collagen IV and collagen VII on the other hand. The area of these extracellular matrix proteins was measured in regions of interest (ROIs) at a magnification of 200X by means of the software imaging system ImageJ. ROIs were defined beneath uninfected and infected regions. In uninfected regions, 22-28 {\%} of the ROI was stained for integrin alpha 6, 18-37 {\%} for laminin, 14-38 {\%} for collagen IV and 18-26 {\%} for collagen VII. In infected regions, the percentage positive for integrin alpha 6 was significantly decreased to 0.1-9 {\%} and 0.1-6 {\%} after 24 and 48 hours of inoculation, respectively. Infection did not alter the percentages for laminin and collagen IV. For collagen VII, an increase in the percentage (from 18-26 {\%} to 28-39 {\%}) could be observed underneath EHV-1-infected plaques at 48 hours of inoculation. In conclusion, the results revealed a substantial impact of EHV-1 infection on integrin alpha 6 and collagen VII, two important components of the extracellular matrix, which are associated with the basement membrane and may facilitate virus penetration via hijacked leukocytes to underlying tissues.},

abstract = {Background: Nipah virus causes respiratory and neurologic disease with case fatality rates up to 100{\%} in individual outbreaks. End stage lesions have been described in the respiratory and nervous systems, vasculature and often lymphoid organs in fatal human cases; however, the initial target organs of Nipah virus infection have not been identified. Here, we detected the initial target tissues and cells of Nipah virus and tracked virus dissemination during the early phase of infection in Syrian hamsters inoculated with a Nipah virus isolate from Malaysia (NiV-M) or Bangladesh (NiV-B). Methodology/Principal Findings: Syrian hamsters were euthanized between 4 and 48 hours post intranasal inoculation and tissues were collected and analyzed for the presence of viral RNA, viral antigen and infectious virus. Virus replication was first detected at 8 hours post inoculation (hpi). Nipah virus initially targeted type I pneumocytes, bronchiolar respiratory epithelium and alveolar macrophages in the lung and respiratory and olfactory epithelium lining the nasal turbinates. By 16 hpi, virus disseminated to epithelial cells lining the larynx and trachea. Although the pattern of viral dissemination was similar for both virus isolates, the rate of spread was slower for NiV-B. Infectious virus was not detected in the nervous system or blood and widespread vascular infection and lesions within lymphoid organs were not observed, even at 48 hpi. Conclusions/Significance: Nipah virus initially targets the respiratory system. Virus replication in the brain and infection of blood vessels in non-respiratory tissues does not occur during the early phase of infection. However, virus replicates early in olfactory epithelium and may serve as the first step towards nervous system dissemination, suggesting that development of vaccines that block virus dissemination or treatments that can access the brain and spinal cord and directly inhibit virus replication may be necessary for preventing central nervous system pathology.},

We tested the ability of two Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus-based viral replicon particle (VEE-VRP) vaccines that express the hRSV or hMPV fusion (F) protein to confer protection against hRSV or hMPV in African green monkeys. Animals immunized with VEE-VRP vaccines developed RSV or MPV F-specific antibodies and serum neutralizing activity.

abstract = {Asthmatics are highly susceptible to respiratory viral infections, possibly due to impaired innate immunity. However, the exact mechanisms of susceptibility are likely to differ amongst viruses. Therefore, we infected primary nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from adults with mild-to-moderate asthma, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human metapneumovirus (hMPV) in vitro and investigated the antiviral response. NECs from these asthmatics supported elevated hMPV but not RSV infection, compared to non-asthmatic controls. This correlated with reduced apoptosis and reduced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3/7 in response to hMPV, but not RSV. The expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a known inhibitor of caspase activation and subsequent apoptosis, was amplified in response to hMPV infection. Chemical inhibition of HSP70 function restored caspase activation and reduced hMPV infection in NECs from asthmatic subjects. There was no impairment in the production of IFN by NECs from asthmatics in response to either hMPV or RSV, demonstrating that increased infection of asthmatic airway cells by hMPV is IFN-independent. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a mechanism for elevated hMPV infection in airway epithelial cells from adult asthmatics and identifies HSP70 as a potential target for antiviral and asthma therapies.},

The purpose of this study was to verify ERAV seroprevalence in selected horses in Poland, in addition to correlation between ERAV and age and sex of analysed animals and the antioxidant status. Methods. The material collected from clinically healthy horses was tested using the VNT (353 serum samples) and virus isolation method (44 nasal swabs). 27 serum samples with antibody titers between 0 and ≥1: 2048 were chosen for further analysis. The study was conducted in group 1 (ERAV titer ≤ 64) and group 2 (ERAV titer {\textgreater} 64). Results. Seroneutralisation tests showed positive results in 72{\%} of serum samples. No significant correlation between ERAV seropositive results and selected biochemical indicators was observed. Group 2 had statistically higher concentrations of SOD and CuZnSOD than the analysed group 1. Conclusions. ERAV was not detected in the nasal swab samples. Antioxidant parameters did not significantly vary between horses of different breed, sex, or age. The ERAV virus had an impact on plasma total SOD and Cu/Zn SOD activity in horses in early stages of convalescence.},

abstract = {Background Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nasal cavity is a rare malignancy and often analyzed in heterogeneous studies with other tumors of the nose or the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate distinct risk factors, tumor characteristics, outcome predictors, and the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in SCC of the nasal cavity. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 39 patients treated at a single quaternary medical care and cancer center. We analyzed tumor characteristics, HPV status, treatment, and outcome. We present the largest study on SCC of the nasal cavity from a single center. Results The majority of patients (70.2{\%}) presented with an early-stage tumor (T1 or T2). Only 1 patient had a single neck metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Four tumors were HPV-positive. Most patients (61.5{\%}) underwent surgical resection without adjuvant treatment, with 12 patients (30.8{\%}) undergoing additional radiotherapy. Three patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. No patient treated primarily with total rhinectomy developed local tumor recurrence. Conclusion Local tumor control is crucial, even if it makes radical surgery necessary. Postoperative epithetic treatment enables reliable follow-up examinations. Regional metastases at the time of diagnosis are rare. Neck dissection should therefore be reserved for cases of suspected metastasis. HPV may also play a role in the etiology of SCC of the nasal cavity.},

abstract = {Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a progressive, multi-systemic, inherited metabolic disease caused by deficiency of $\alpha$-L-iduronidase (IDUA). Current treatments for this disease are ineffective in treating central nervous system (CNS) disease due to the inability of lysosomal enzymes to traverse the blood-brain barrier. A noninvasive and effective approach was taken in the treatment of CNS disease by intranasal administration of an IDUA-encoding adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) vector. Adult IDUA-deficient mice aged 3 months were instilled intranasally with AAV9-IDUA vector. Animals sacrificed 5 months post instillation exhibited IDUA enzyme activity levels that were up to 50-fold that of wild-type mice in the olfactory bulb, with wild-type levels of enzyme restored in all other parts of the brain. Intranasal treatment with AAV9-IDUA also resulted in the reduction of tissue glycosaminoglycan storage materials in the brain. There was strong IDUA immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections observed in the nasal epithelium and olfactory bulb, but there was no evidence of the presence of transduced cells in other portions of the brain. This indicates that reduction of storage materials most likely occurred as a result of enzyme diffusion from the olfactory bulb and the nasal epithelium into deeper areas of the brain. At 8 months of age, neurocognitive testing using the Barnes maze to assess spatial navigation demonstrated that treated IDUA-deficient mice were no different from normal control animals, while untreated IDUA-deficient mice exhibited significant learning and navigation deficits. This novel, noninvasive strategy for intranasal AAV9-IDUA instillation could potentially be used to treat CNS manifestations of human MPS I.},

abstract = {Background: There are very limited data on children with pneumonia in Mali. The objective was to assess the etiology and factors associated with community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized children {\textless}5 years of age in Mali. Methods: A prospective hospital-based case-control study was implemented in the Pediatric department of Gabriel Tour{\'{e}} University Hospital at Bamako, Mali, between July 2011-December 2012. Cases were children with radiologically-confirmed pneumonia; Controls were hospitalized children without respiratory features, matched for age and period. Respiratory specimens, were collected to identify 19 viruses and 5 bacteria. Whole blood was collected from cases only. Factors associated with pneumonia were assessed by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Overall, 118 cases and 98 controls were analyzed; 44.1{\%} were female, median age was 11 months. Among pneumonia cases, 30.5{\%} were hypoxemic at admission, mortality was 4.2{\%}. Pneumonia cases differed from the controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms but not in terms of past medical history. Multivariate analysis of nasal swab findings disclosed that S. pneumoniae (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI]: 1.6-7.0), human metapneumovirus (aOR = 17.2, 95{\%} CI: 2.0-151.4), respiratory syn-cytial virus [RSV] (aOR = 7.4, 95{\%} CI: 2.3-23.3), and influenza A virus (aOR = 10.7, 95{\%} CI: 1.0-112.2) were associated with pneumonia, independently of patient age, gender, period, and other pathogens. Distribution of S. pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S. pneumoniae in January-June and of RSV in July-September. Pneu-mococcal serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls (P = 0.009, and P = 0.04, respectively). Conclusions In this non-PCV population from Mali, pneumonia in children was mainly attributed to S. pneumoniae, RSV, human metapneumovirus, and influenza A virus. Increased pneumo-coccal conjugate vaccine coverage in children could significantly reduce the burden of pneumonia in sub-Saharan African countries.},

We detected anti-Gag (p24) and envelope (gp140) antibodies in both nasal fluid and salivary collections from all HIV-infected individuals, and cross-reactive anti-p24 antibodies were detected in 10{\%} of HIV-uninfected individuals enrolled at one site. Collections from the nasal turbinates were comparable with samples collected deeper in the nasopharyngeal tract, and the yield of antip24 IgA in the whole oral fluid samples was higher than in samples collected from the parotid gland. We noted a trend toward reduced levels of anti-HIV antibody in the volunteers receiving anti-retroviral therapy. Levels of antibodies were stable over multiple collection visits. Overall, this study shows that nasal and salivary samples can be collected in a standardized manner over repeated visits in both low- and high-resource settings. These methods may be used in support for future HIV vaccine clinical trials.},

Objective - To find the prevalence of hepatitis B and C infection in community and study the risk factors for their transmission. Methods - This was a community based cross sectional study. A total of 1833 randomly selected subjects from a rural area were interviewed for risk factors for transmission and tested for markers of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection. All the positive card tests were confirmed by ELISA. Results -Out of 2400 subjects, rate for participation was 76.38{\%}. None of the subjects was positive for anti hepatitis C virus antibody. Point prevalence for HBsAg positivity was 0.92. Being healthcare worker and having tattoo were significantly associated with HBsAg positive results. Nose and ear piercing was reported by almost. History of blood or blood product transfusion, I/V drug abuse, multiple sexual partners, unsafe Injections, hemodialysis and any h/o surgery was not associated with HBsAg positivity. Conclusion - Health care workers are at high risk for transmission of hepatitis B.

We describe EV-D68 rates, spectrum of illness, and risk factors from prospective, population-based acute respiratory illness (ARI) surveillance at a large US pediatric hospital. Methods. Children {\textless}13 years of age with ARI and residence in Hamilton County, Ohio were enrolled from the inpatient and emergency department (ED) settings at a children's hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, from 1 July to 31 October 2014. For each participant, we interviewed parents, reviewed medical records, and tested nasal and throat swabs for EV-D68 using real-time reverse- transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. Results. EV-D68 infection was detected in 51 of 207 (25{\%}) inpatients and 58 of 505 (11{\%}) ED patients. Rates of EV-D68 hospitalization and ED visit were 1.3 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.6) and 8.4 per 1000 children {\textless}13 years of age, respectively. Preexisting asthma was associated with EV-D68 infection (adjusted odds ratio, 3.2; 95{\%} CI, 2.0-5.1). Compared with other ARI, children with EV-D68 were more likely to be admitted from the ED (P ≤.001), receive supplemental oxygen (P =.001), and require intensive care unit admission (P =.04); however, mechanical ventilation was uncommon (2/51 inpatients; P =.64), and no deaths occurred. Conclusions. During the 2014 EV-D68 epidemic, high rates of pediatric hospitalizations and ED visits were observed. Children with asthma were at increased risk for medically attended EV-D68 illness. Preparedness planning for a high-activity EV-D68 season in the United States should take into account increased healthcare utilization, particularly among children with asthma, during the late summer and early fall.},

abstract = {Despite great enthusiasm towards immunotherapy, reliable biomarkers are still lacking. The importance of subsets based on human papillomavirus (HPV) status is supported by a growing body of evidence. However, role of other possible subgroups such as anatomic localization of primary tumor remains controversial. Our objective was to investigate immune cell infiltrate and checkpoint inhibitor proteins in above-mentioned head and neck cancer subsets. Archival tumor samples of 106 laryngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer patients were stained with PD-L1, PD-L2, PD-1, and CTLA-4 antibodies. Proportion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was assessed as well. In HPV-negative tumors, PD-L1 immune cell positivity was associated with better disease-specific survival. PD-L1 expression on immune cells correlated with improved disease-specific survival in laryngeal tumors. Furthermore, PDL1 immune cell positivity correlated with CTLA-4 expression on immune cells and it was accompanied by high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte rate. PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and PD-1 status showed strong correlation in all patients and in oropharyngeal and laryngeal localization, but not in hypopharynx. HPVnegative oropharyngeal cancers showed negative PD-L1 status on tumor cells. CTLA-4 positivity was observed in 49.5{\%} and 20.6{\%} on immune cells and on tumor cells, respectively. We concluded that PD-L1 expression on immune cells indicates better prognosis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We have not found any essential differences between anatomic subgroups. A possibly distinct role of hypopharyngeal localization regarding immune activity requires further clarification.},

abstract = {Background: It is recommended to vaccinate pregnant women against influenza. A possible impact on the immune expression of the fetus has never been studied. We aim to study the immune signature in the upper airways and the incidence of infections in neonates born to mothers receiving Influenza A(H1N1)pnd09 vaccination during pregnancy. Methods: One hundred and fifty-six women from the unselected Copenhagen Prospective Study on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) received Influenza A(H1N1)pnd09-vaccination during the 2009 pandemic. Fifty-one mothers received the vaccine during pregnancy and 105 after pregnancy; 332 neonates of nonvaccinated mothers were included as secondary controls. Nasal mucosal lining fluid was sampled in 488 neonates and assessed for interleukin (IL)-12p70, IP-10, interferon-gamma (IFN)-$\gamma$, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-$\alpha$, MIP-1$\beta$, MCP-1, MCP-4, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin-1, eotaxin-3, TARC, MDC, IL-17, IL-1$\beta$, IL-8, transforming growth factor beta (TGF)-$\beta$1, IL-10 and IL-2. Infections were monitored the first year of life by daily diary cards and clinical controls. Results: Neonates of mothers vaccinated during pregnancy had significant up-regulation of TGF-$\beta$1 [ratio = 1.52 (1.22-1.90), P = 0.0002], and corresponding down-regulation (P {\textless} 0.05) of IL-12p70, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-5, eotaxin-1, TARC, MDC, IL-8 in comparison to those vaccinated after pregnancy. The lag-time from vaccination during pregnancy to assessment of the immune signature showed significant and positive association to up-regulation of TGF-$\beta$1 levels (P = 0.0003) and significant negative association to other mediators. The study was not powered to study differences in the incidence of infections in early infancy which did not differ between the study groups. Conclusion: Influenza A(H1N1)pnd09 vaccination during pregnancy up-regulates TGF-$\beta$1 and down-regulates key mediators of the protective immunity.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) is well established as a causative factor in most squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx (OPSCC). Indeed, a growing awareness over the past two decades that HPV-OPSCC is a distinct form of head and neck cancer has had a profound impact on diagnostic and clinical practices. The sinonasal tract is a second anatomic “hot spot” for HPV-related head and neck carcinomas, but certain pathologic features and the clinical behavior of HPV-related carcinomas at this site remain unclear. The enigmatic nature of HPV-positive sinonasal carcinomas is especially true for an emerging form recently designated as HPV-related multiphenotypic sinonasal carcinoma (HMSC). HMSC has come to the attention of the pathology community largely owing to its highly unusual microscopic appearance: it exhibits mixed salivary gland (e.g. adenoid cystic carcinoma) and squamous differentiation. At the same time, HMSC is largely unknown by the clinical community despite an unexpected clinical behavior that could affect therapy. HMSC is characterized by high grade histologic features, locally destructive growth, advanced T stage, and a propensity for local recurrence; and yet it appears to have little potential for metastatic spread or lethal behavior. This review will describe the unique pathologic features of HMSC, discuss its distinction from adenoid cystic carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and draw attention to a behavior that departs from the expected clinical course of most high grade carcinomas of the head and neck.},

abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals. We have reported (Cubillos et al., 2008) that a synthetic dendrimeric peptide consisting of four copies of a B-cell epitope [VP1(136-154)] linked through thioether bonds to a T-cell epitope [3A(21-35)] of FMDV [B 4 T(thi)] elicits potent B- and T-cell specific responses and confers solid protection in pigs to type C FMDV challenge. Herein we show that downsized versions of this peptide bearing two copies of a B-cell epitope from a type O isolate and using thioether [B 2 T(thi)] or maleimide [B 2 T(mal)] conjugation chemistries for their synthesis elicited in swine similar or higher B and T-cell specific responses than tetravalent B 4 T(thi). Moreover, while partial protection was observed in animals immunized with B 4 T(thi) (60{\%}) and B 2 T(thi) (80{\%}), B 2 T(mal) conferred full (100{\%}) protection against FMDV challenge, associated to high levels of circulating IgG2 and mucosal IgGA, and entirely prevented virus shedding. Interestingly, B 2 T(mal) is also the most advantageous option in terms of synthetic practicality. Taken together, the results reported here point out to B 2 T(mal) as a highly valuable, cost-effective FMDV candidate vaccine.},

abstract = {Although sociability offers many advantages, a major drawback is the increased risk of exposure to contagious pathogens, like parasites, viruses, or bacteria [1]. Social species have evolved various behavioral strategies reducing the probability of pathogen exposure [2]. In rodents, sick conspecific avoidance can be induced by olfactory cues emitted by parasitized or infected conspecifics [3-6]. The neural circuits involved in this behavior remain largely unknown. We observed that olfactory cues present in bodily products of mice in an acute inflammatory state or infected with a viral pathogen are aversive to conspecifics. We found that these chemical signals trigger neural activity in the vomeronasal system, an olfactory subsystem controlling various innate behaviors [7]. Supporting the functional relevance of these observations, we show that preference toward healthy individuals is abolished in mice with impaired vomeronasal function. These findings reveal a novel function played by the vomeronasal system.},

abstract = {Background: Influenza infects tens of millions of people every year in the USA. Other than notable risk groups, such as children and the elderly, it is difficult to predict what subpopulations are at higher risk of infection. Viral challenge studies, where healthy human volunteers are inoculated with live influenza virus, provide a unique opportunity to study infection susceptibility. Biomarkers predicting influenza susceptibility would be useful for identifying risk groups and designing vaccines. Methods: We applied cell mixture deconvolution to estimate immune cell proportions from whole blood transcriptome data in four independent influenza challenge studies. We compared immune cell proportions in the blood between symptomatic shedders and asymptomatic nonshedders across three discovery cohorts prior to influenza inoculation and tested results in a held-out validation challenge cohort. Results: Natural killer (NK) cells were significantly lower in symptomatic shedders at baseline in both discovery and validation cohorts. Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were higher in symptomatic shedders at baseline in discovery cohorts. Although the HSPCs were higher in symptomatic shedders in the validation cohort, the increase was statistically nonsignificant. We observed that a gene associated with NK cells, KLRD1, which encodes CD94, was expressed at lower levels in symptomatic shedders at baseline in discovery and validation cohorts. KLRD1 expression in the blood at baseline negatively correlated with influenza infection symptom severity. KLRD1 expression 8h post-infection in the nasal epithelium from a rhinovirus challenge study also negatively correlated with symptom severity. Conclusions: We identified KLRD1-expressing NK cells as a potential biomarker for influenza susceptibility. Expression of KLRD1 was inversely correlated with symptom severity. Our results support a model where an early response by KLRD1-expressing NK cells may control influenza infection.},

abstract = {Background: Respiratory viral diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infections has largely developed through multiplex molecular techniques. Although the sensitivity of different types of upper respiratory tract samples seems to be correlated to the number of sampled cells, this link remains largely unexplored. Methods: Our study included 800 upper respiratory tract specimens of which 400 negative and 400 positive for viral detection in multiplex PCR. All samples were selected and matched for age in these 2 groups. For the positive group, samples were selected for the detected viral species. Results: Among the factors influencing the cellularity were the type of sample (p {\textless} 0.0001); patient age (p {\textless} 0.001); viral positive or negative nature of the sample (p = 0.002); and, for the positive samples, the number of viral targets detected (0.004 {\textless} p {\textless} 0.049) and viral species. Conclusion: The cellular load of upper respiratory samples is multifactorial and occurs for many in the sensitivity of molecular detection. However it was not possible to determine a minimum cellularity threshold allowing molecular viral detection. The differences according to the type of virus remain to be studied on a larger scale.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Early diagnosis and treatment of patients with influenza is the reason why physicians need rapid high-sensitivity influenza diagnostic tests that require no complex lab equipment and can be performed and interpreted within 15 min. The Aim of this study was to compare the rapid Directigen Flu A+B test with real time PCR for detection of influenza viruses in the Republic of Macedonia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One-hundred-eight respiratory samples (combined nose and throat swabs) were routinely collected for detection of influenza virus during influenza seasons. Forty-one patients were pediatric cases and 59 were adult. Their mean age was 23 years. The patients were allocated into 6 age groups: 0-4 yrs, 5-9 yrs, 10-14 yrs, 15-19 yrs, 20-64 yrs and {\textgreater} 65 yrs. Each sample was tested with Directigen Flu A+B and CDC real time PCR kit for detection and typisation/subtypisation of influenza according to the lab diagnostic protocol.
RESULTS: Directigen Flu A+B identified influenza A virus in 20 (18.5{\%}) samples and influenza B virus in two 2 (1.9{\%}) samples. The high specificity (100{\%}) and PPV of Directigen Flu A+B we found in our study shows that the positive results do not need to be confirmed. The overall sensitivity of Directigen Flu A+B is 35.1{\%} for influenza A virus and 33.0{\%} for influenza B virus. The sensitivity for influenza A is higher among children hospitalized (45.0{\%}) and outpatients (40.0{\%}) versus adults.
CONCLUSION: Directigen Flu A+B has relatively low sensitivity for detection of influenza viruses in combined nose and throat swabs. Negative results must be confirmed.},

abstract = {Agricultural fairs create an unconventional animal-human interface that has been associated with swine-to-human transmission of influenza A virus (IAV) in recent years. Early detection of IAV-infected pigs at agricultural fairs would allow veterinarians to better protect swine and human health during these swine exhibitions. This study assessed the use of swine body temperature measurement, recorded by infrared and rectal thermometers, as a practical method to detect IAV-infected swine at agricultural fairs. In our first objective, infrared thermometers were used to record the body surface temperature of 1,092 pigs at the time of IAV nasal swab collection at the end of the exhibition period of 55 agricultural fairs. IAV was recovered from 212 (19.4{\%}) pigs, and the difference in mean infrared body temperature measurement of IAV-positive and IAV-negative pigs was 0.83°C. In a second objective, snout wipes were collected from 1,948 pigs immediately prior to the unloading of the animals at a single large swine exhibition. Concurrent to the snout wipe collection, owners took the rectal temperatures of his/her pigs. In this case, 47 (2.4{\%}) pigs tested positive for IAV before they entered the swine barn. The mean rectal temperatures differed by only 0.19°C between IAV-positive and IAV-negative pigs. The low prevalence of IAV among the pigs upon entry to the fair in the second objective provides evidence that limiting intraspecies spread of IAV during the fairs will likely have significant impacts on the zoonotic transmission. However, in both objectives, the high degree of similarity in the body temperature measurements between the IAV-positive and IAV-negative pigs made it impossible to set a diagnostically meaningful cut point to differentiate IAV status of the individual animals. Unfortunately, body temperature measurement cannot be used to accurately screen exhibition swine for IAV.},

abstract = {Head and neck cancer treatment protocols still lack well-established biomarkers of prognostic and predictive value. It is well known that human papillomavirus (HPV)-related and non-HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers are distinct entities concerning tumor biology and clinical outcome. However, there is an ongoing debate whether tumor suppressor p16INK4 status alone or both p16INK4 and HPV detection should be used in clinical settings. The aim of this study was to investigate p16INK4-immunolabelled and HPV-induced rates and determine their clinical significance in 110 primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The expression of p16INK4 protein was assessed with immunohistochemistry, while high-risk HPV detection was performed using DNA PCR method. P16INK4 immunolabelling was detected in 17.3{\%} of all tumor samples, and in 38.1{\%} of oropharyngeal malignancies. Oropharyngeal, p16INK4-immunolabelled tumors showed an improved disease-specific survival compared to the non-p16INK4-immunolabelled group (median survival: 30.3 vs. 8.8 months, p {\textless} 0.001 with the log-rank test). Furthermore, 56{\%} of p16INK4-immunolabelled cases were tested positive for HPV-DNA. The HPV-induced group presented better disease-specific survival compared to the non-HPV-induced cases (median survival: 25.9 vs. 9.5 months, p = 0.024 with the log-rank test). Improved response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy were observed both in p16INK4-immunolabelled and p16INK4- immunolabelled/HPV DNA- containing groups (Fisher's exact test: p = 0.025 and p = 0.009). In conclusion, p16INK4 immunohistochemistry proved to be a reliable and affordable tool for prognostic and predictive testing of head and neck squamous cell cancers. The p16INK4 immunopositivity status alone was confirmed to be an equally precise indicator of clinical outcome as p16INK4/HPV DNA PCR double testing.},

abstract = {Background: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are frequent etiologic agents of tract infections, ranging from benign upper to potentially life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections. Diagnosis is based on molecular methods. 169 HRV types, belonging to species A, B and C, have been identified. This high genetic diversity makes it difficult to accurately detect circulating HRVs and to diagnose severe infection. Objectives: To comparatively assess the ability to detect HRV clinical isolates of the first version (V1) of the commercial real-time RT-PCR Rhino{\&}EV/Cc r-gene{\textregistered} (bioM{\'{e}}rieux) kit, of an in-house RT-PCR followed by genotyping, considered as the reference method, and of the second version of this commercial test (V2). Study design: From September 2011 to April 2013, HRVs were prospectively detected in 2525 respiratory specimens, using V1 in combination with the in-house reference RT-PCR. In November 2013, 85 specimens that had given initially false negative results with V1 were retested simultaneously with V1 and V2 and the in-house RT-PCR. In addition, 421 negative specimens with the in-house assay were prospectively tested with V2. Results: Among the 2525 specimens, V1 detected 80.7{\%} (502/622) of in-house RT-PCR positive isolates: 85.3{\%} (220/258) of HRV-A, 84.4{\%} (27/32) of HRV-B and 74.9{\%} (176/235) of HRV-C. Among the 85 respiratory samples tested with V1, V2 and the in-house RT-PCR, V2 was more efficient than V1 in detecting 16 HRV isolates: 11/33 (33.3{\%}) of HRV-A and 5/47 (10.6{\%}) of HRV-C tested. The analytical sensitivity of V2 was greater for 8/18 HRV-A genotypes and 2/22 HRV-C genotypes. Relative to the in-house assay, the specificity of V2 was 100{\%} (421/421). Conclusions: This study showed a slightly higher sensitivity of V2. However, diverse genotypes, especially HRV-C, were undetected.},

abstract = {Background: Respiratory viruses are associated with a huge socio-economic burden and are responsible for a large proportion of acute respiratory illness in hospitalised adults. Laboratory PCR is accurate but takes at least 24 h to generate a result to clinicians and antigen-based point-of-care tests (POCT) lack sensitivity. Rapid molecular platforms, such as the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, have equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR and can generate a result in 1 h making them deployable as POCT. Molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in hospital has the potential to improve the detection rate of respiratory viruses, improve the use of influenza antivirals and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, but high quality randomised trials with clinically relevant endpoints are needed. Methods: The ResPOC study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory illness presenting to a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom. Eligible participants are adults presenting with acute respiratory illness to the emergency department or the acute medicine unit. Participants are allocated 1:1 by internet-based randomisation service to either the intervention of a nose and throat swab analysed immediately on the FilmArray Respiratory Panel as a POCT or receive routine clinical care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include turnaround time, virus detection, neuraminidase inhibitor use, length of hospital stay and side room use. Analysis of the primary outcome will be by intention-to-treat and all enrolled participants will be included in safety analysis. Discussion: Multiple novel molecular POCT platforms for infections including respiratory viruses have been developed and licensed in the last few years and many more are in development but the evidence base for clinical benefit above standard practice is minimal. This randomised controlled trial aims to close this evidence gap by generating high quality evidence for the clinical impact of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses in secondary care and to act as an exemplar for future studies of molecular POCT for infections. This study has the potential to change practice and improve patient care for patients presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness. Trial registration: This study was registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN90211642 , on 14th January 2015.},

abstract = {BackgroundLongitudinal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) dynamics have not been well studied despite the existence of factors favoring prolonged RSV replication including high mutation rates allowing rapid evolution and potential escape from immune control. We therefore measured viral load in previously RSV-naive infants over prolonged time spans.MethodsDuring 2014-2015, quantitative nasal aspirates were collected from 51 RSV-PCR+ infants. Multiple parallel assessments of viral loads were quantified at each collected time point using a well-validated real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. After observing viral load rebound phenomenon in some infants, the viral dynamics of 27 infants with sufficient longitudinal viral load data points were analyzed using the pre-defined criteria for viral rebound. Additional analyses were performed comparing age with viral rebound, viral clearance rates, and viral load area-under-the-curve (AUC VL).ResultsThe 51 infants (303 nasal aspirate samples; mean of 5.9 per patient) exhibited slower than expected viral clearance. Lower age trended toward slower viral clearance and greater AUC VL. Six infants had detectable viral loads ≥1 month after symptom onset. Ten of twenty-seven evaluable subjects exhibited viral rebound and this rebound was age-dependent (P=0.0259). All but one rebounder were {\textless}70 days old.ConclusionInfants struggle to control primary RSV infections allowing prolonged viral replication and previously undescribed viral rebound; likely representing viral mutational immune escape.},

abstract = {The choice of model used to study human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is extremely important. RSV is a human pathogen that is exquisitely adapted to infection of human hosts. Rodent models, such as mice and cotton rats, are semi-permissive to RSV infection and do not faithfully reproduce hallmarks of RSV disease in humans. Furthermore, immortalized airway-derived cell lines, such as HEp-2, BEAS-2B, and A549 cells, are poorly representative of the complexity of the respiratory epithelium. The development of a well-differentiated primary pediatric airway epithelial cell models (WD-PAECs) allows us to simulate several hallmarks of RSV infection of infant airways. They therefore represent important additions to RSV pathogenesis modeling in human-relevant tissues. The following protocols describe how to culture and differentiate both bronchial and nasal primary pediatric airway epithelial cells and how to use these cultures to study RSV cytopathogenesis.},

abstract = {Reports describing the isolation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H5N1) clade 2.3.2 in feces from apparently healthy wild birds and the seemingly lower pathogenicity of this clade compared to clade 2.2 in several experimentally infected species, caused concern that the new clade might be maintained in the wild bird population. To investigate whether the pathogenicity of a clade 2.3.2 virus was lower than that of clades previously occurring in free-living wild birds in Europe, four tufted ducks were inoculated with influenza A/duck/HongKong/1091/2011 (H5N1) clade 2.3.2 virus. The ducks were monitored and sampled for virus excretion daily during 4 days, followed by pathologic, immunohistochemical, and virological investigations. The virus produced severe disease as evidenced by clinical signs, presence of marked lesions and abundant viral antigen in several tissues, especially the central nervous system. The study shows that HPAI-H5N1 virus clade 2.3.2 is highly pathogenic for tufted ducks and thus, they are unlikely to maintain this clade in the free-living population or serve as long-distance vectors.},

abstract = {Synaptic NMDA receptors activating nuclear calcium-driven adaptogenomics control a potent body-own neuroprotective mechanism, referred to as acquired neuroprotection. Viral vector-mediated gene transfer in conjunction with stereotactic surgery has previously demonstrated the proficiency of several nuclear calcium-regulated genes to protect in vivo against brain damage caused by toxic extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling following seizures or stroke. Here we used noninvasive nose-to-brain administration of Activin A and SerpinB2, two secreted nuclear calcium-regulated neuroprotectants, for post-injury treatment of brain damage following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in C57BL/6N mice. The observed reduction of the infarct volume was comparable to the protection obtained by intracerebroventricular injection of recombinant Activin A or SerpinB2 or by stereotactic delivery 3 weeks prior to the injury of a recombinant adeno-associated virus containing an expression cassette for the potent neuroprotective transcription factor Npas4. These results establish post-injury, nose-to-brain delivery of Activin A and SerpinB2 as effective and possibly clinically applicable treatments of acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. A novel non-invasive neuroprotective treatment has been developed that uses intranasal application of Activin A and SerpinB2. This therapeutic approach reduces brain damage in a mouse stroke model, and it may also be beneficial in chronic neurodegenerative diseases.},

The aim of the study was to study and to compare simple infections and viral coinfections of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in hospitalized children. From September 2005 to August 2013, a prospective study was conducted on children younger than 14 years of age, admitted with respiratory infection to the Pediatric Department of the Severo Ochoa Hospital, in Spain. Specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were taken for virological study by using polymerase chain reaction, and clinical data were recorded. Simple RSV infections were selected and compared with double infections of RSV with rhinovirus (RV) or with human bocavirus (HBoV). In this study, 2993 episodes corresponding to 2525 children were analyzed. At least 1 virus was detected in 77{\%} (2312) of the episodes. Single infections (599 RSV, 513 RV, and 81 HBoV) were compared with 120 RSV-RV and 60 RSV-HBoV double infections. The RSV-RV coinfections had fever (63{\%} vs 43{\%}; Pgt;0.001) and hypoxia (70{\%} vs 43{\%}; Pgt;0.001) more often than RV infections. Hypoxia was similar between single or dual infections (71{\%}). Bronchiolitis was more frequent in the RSV simple group (Pgt;0.001). Pediatric intensive care unit admission was more common in RSV simple or RSV-RV groups than in the RV monoinfection (P=0.042). Hospitalization was longer for both RSV simple group and RSVHBoV coinfection, lasting about 1 day (4.7 vs 3.8 days; Pgt;0.001) longer than in simple HBoV infections. There were no differences in PICU admission. RSV single group was of a younger age than the other groups. Coinfections between RSV-RV and RSV-HBoV are frequent. Overall viral coinfections do not present greater severity, but have mixed clinical features.},

In this study we evaluated susceptibility of goats to infection by Bubaline alphaherpesvirus 1 (BuHV-1). Four goats were inoculated intra-nasally with BuHV-1 and monitored clinically, virologically and serologically for 42 days. None of the goats displayed clinical signs although all the animals variably shed the virus by the nasal route during the first 12 days after infection. BuHV-1 was also detected in the white blood cells of two animals in the first week post infection. The results suggest that goats are susceptible to BuHV-1 infection and that they could play an epidemiological role in the circulation/transmission of the virus among domestic and wild ruminants and impact to some extent on the control plans for herpesviruses in cattle.},

abstract = {Swine farms provide a dynamic environment for the evolution of influenza A viruses (IAVs). The present report shows the results of a surveillance effort of IAV infection in one commercial swine farm in Argentina. Two cross-sectional serological and virological studies (n = 480) were carried out in 2011 and 2012. Virus shedding was detected in nasal samples from pigs from ages 7, 21 and 42-days old. More than 90{\%} of sows and gilts but less than 40{\%} of 21-days old piglets had antibodies against IAV. In addition, IAV was detected in 8/17 nasal swabs and 10/15 lung samples taken from necropsied pigs. A subset of these samples was further processed for virus isolation resulting in 6 viruses of the H1N2 subtype ($\delta$2 cluster). Pathological studies revealed an association between suppurative bronchopneumonia and necrotizing bronchiolitis with IAV positive samples. Statistical analyses showed that the degree of lesions in bronchi, bronchiole, and alveoli was higher in lungs positive to IAV. The results of this study depict the relevance of continuing long-term active surveillance of IAV in swine populations to establish IAV evolution relevant to swine and humans.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence to suggest that the sinus microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, the concentration of these microorganisms within the sinuses is still unknown. We show that flow cytometry can be used to enumerate bacteria and virus-like particles (VLPs) in sinus flush samples of CRS patients. This was achieved through trialling 5 sample preparation techniques for flow cytometry. We found high concentrations of bacteria and VLPs in these samples. Untreated samples produced the highest average bacterial and VLP counts with 3.3 ± 0.74 × 107 bacteria ml-1 and 2.4 ± 1.23 × 109 VLP ml-1 of sinus flush (n = 9). These counts were significantly higher than most of the treated samples (p {\textless} 0.05). Results showed 103 and 104 times inter-patient variation for bacteria and VLP concentrations. This wide variation suggests that diagnosis and treatment need to be personalised and that utilising flow cytometry is useful and efficient for this. This study is the first to enumerate bacterial and VLP populations in the maxillary sinus of CRS patients. The relevance of enumeration is that with increasing antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics are becoming less effective at treating bacterial infections of the sinuses, so alternative therapies are needed. Phage therapy has been proposed as one such alternative, but for dosing, the abundance of bacteria is required. Knowledge of whether phages are normally present in the sinuses will assist in gauging the safety of applying phage therapy to sinuses. Our finding, that large numbers of VLP are frequently present in sinuses, indicates that phage therapy may represent a minimally disruptive intervention towards the nasal microbiome. We propose that flow cytometry can be used as a tool to assess microbial biomass dynamics in sinuses and other anatomical locations where infection can cause disease.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the impact of primary gross tumor volume (pGTV) and nodal gross tumor volume (nGTV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and the difference in their role between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative patients. Methods: The patient cohort consists of 91 OPSCC patients treated with definitive radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). All patients had a minimum follow-up of 31 months. Volume measurements were made from computer tomography (CT) scans and HPV status was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry. The end points were as follows: overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and locoregional control (LRC). Results: pGTV was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS; p = 0.020) in p16-negative patients. nGTV of p16-negative tumors had significant prognostic value in all end points in multivariate analyses. High-stage (III–IVc) p16-negative tumors were only associated with significantly poorer OS (p = 0.046) but not with poorer LRC or DFS when compared with the low-stage (I–II) tumors. nGTV of p16-positive tumors was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (p = 0.005) and LRC (p = 0.007) in multivariate analyses. Conclusion: pGTV may serve as an independent prognostic factor in p16-negative patients and nGTV may serve as an independent prognostic factor both in p16-positive and p16-negative patients treated with radiochemotherapy or radiotherapy using IMRT. Tumor volume may have an impact on selecting patients for de-escalation protocols in the future, both in p16-positive and p16-negative patients.},

abstract = {A multitude of factors must be overcome following spinal cord injury (SCI) in order to achieve clinical improvement in patients. It is thought that by combining promising therapies these diverse factors could be combatted with the aim of producing an overall improvement in function. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) present in the glial scar that forms following SCI present a significant block to axon regeneration. Digestion of CSPGs by chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) leads to axon regeneration, neuronal plasticity and functional improvement in preclinical models of SCI. However, the enzyme activity decays at body temperature within 24-72 h, limiting the translational potential of ChABC as a therapy. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have shown huge promise as a cell transplant therapy in SCI. Their beneficial effects have been demonstrated in multiple small animal SCI models as well as in naturally occurring SCI in canine patients. In the present study, we have genetically modified canine OECs from the mucosa to constitutively produce enzymatically active ChABC. We have developed a lentiviral vector that can deliver a mammalian modified version of the ChABC gene to mammalian cells, including OECs. Enzyme production was quantified using the Morgan-Elson assay that detects the breakdown products of CSPG digestion in cell supernatants. We confirmed our findings by immunolabelling cell supernatant samples using Western blotting. OECs normal cell function was unaffected by genetic modification as demonstrated by normal microscopic morphology and the presence of the low affinity neurotrophin receptor (p75NGF) following viral transduction. We have developed the means to allow production of active ChABC in combination with a promising cell transplant therapy for SCI repair.},

Few studies compared the viral expression profiles in the two types of tumor. We analyzed HPV genotypes and viral load as well as early (E2/E4, E5, E6, E6*I, E6*II, E7) and late (L1 and L2) gene expression of HPV16 in cervical and oropharyngeal cancer biopsies. The study included 28 cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and ten oropharyngeal SCC, along with pair-matched non-tumor tissues, as well as four oropharynx dysplastic tissues and 112 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia biopsies. Viral load was found higher in cervical SCC ({\textless}1 to 694 copies/cell) and CIN ({\textless}1 to 43 copies/cell) compared to oropharyngeal SCC ({\textless}1 to 4 copies/cell). HPV16 E2/E4 and E5 as well as L1 and L2 mRNA levels were low in cervical SCC and CIN and undetectable in oropharynx cases. The HPV16 E6 and E7 mRNAs were consistently high in cervical SCC and low in oropharyngeal SCC. The analysis of HPV16 E6 mRNA expression pattern showed statistically significant higher levels of E6*I versus E6*II isoform in cervical SCC (p = 0.002) and a slightly higher expression of E6*I versus E6*II in oropharyngeal cases. In conclusion, the HPV16 E5, E6, E6*I, E6*II and E7 mRNA levels were more abundant in cervical SCC compared to oropharyngeal SCC suggesting different carcinogenic mechanisms in the two types of HPV-related cancers.},

abstract = {Breed-to-wean pig farms play an important role in spreading influenza A virus (IAV) because suckling piglets maintain, diversify and transmit IAV at weaning to other farms. Understanding the nature and extent of which farm factors drive IAV infection in piglets is a prerequisite to reduce the burden of influenza in swine. We evaluated the association between IAV infection in piglets at weaning and farm factors including farm features, herd management practices and gilt- and piglet-specific management procedures performed at the farm. Voluntarily enrolled breed-to-wean farms (n = 83) agreed to share IAV diagnostic testing and farm data from July 2011 through March 2017 including data obtained via the administration of a survey. There were 23{\%} IAV RT-PCR positive samples of the 12,814 samples submitted for IAV testing within 2989 diagnostic submissions with 30{\%} positive submissions. Among all the factors evaluated (n = 24), and considering the season-adjusted multivariable analysis, only sow IAV vaccination and gilt IAV status at entry significantly reduced (p-value{\textless}0.05) IAV infections in piglets at weaning. Results from this study indicate that veterinarians and producers could manage these identified factors to reduce the burden of influenza in piglets prior to wean and perhaps, reduce the spread of IAV to other farms and people.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of nasopharyngeal and sinonasal tumors are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or human papillomavirus (HPV). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma harbor EBV in practically all cases, although a small proportion of cases of the former harbor HPV Sinonasal inverted papillomas harbor HPV in about 25{\%} of cases. Sinonasal squamous cell carcinomas harbor transcriptionally active HPV in about 20{\%} of cases, and limited data suggest that this subset has a better prognosis than the HPV-negative subset. This review addresses the diagnostic issues of the EBV-associated tumors. Difficulties in diagnosis of NPC may be encountered when there are prominent crush artifacts, many admixed lymphoid cells masking the neoplastic cells, or numerous interspersed granulomas, whereas benign cellular components (epithelial crypts and germinal centers) and reactive lymphoid hyperplasia can potentially be mistaken for NPC. Immunostaining for pan-cytokeratin and/or in situ hybridization for EBER can help in confirming or refuting a diagnosis of NPC. The main diagnostic problem of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is recognition of the neoplastic nature of those examples predominated by small cells or showing a mixture of cells. The identification of a destructive infiltrate (dense expansile infiltrate; angiocentric growth) and definite cytologic atypia (clear cells; many medium-sized cells) would favor a diagnosis of lymphoma, which can be supported by immunohistochemistry (most commonly CD3+, CD5 -, CD56+) and in situ hybridization for EBER. In conclusion, among nasopharyngeal and sinonasal neoplasms, demonstration of EBV may aid in diagnosis, particularly NPC and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Demonstration of HPV does not have a role yet in diagnosis, although this may change in the future.},

abstract = {Older adults suffer a disproportionate burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality typically attributed to defects in the aging immune system collectively known as immunosenescence. While the age-related decline in the adaptive immune system has been well characterized, little is known about how aging affects the principal site of influenza infection—the nasal epithelium. In human nasal epithelial cell cultures (hNECs) from older adults, we found similar or increased levels of cytokines during influenza infection compared with hNECs from younger individuals. However, hNECs from older individuals demonstrated decreased mRNA expression for several key proteins that affect clearance of infected cells, including MHC-I and transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). These findings were confirmed at the level of protein expression. In vivo studies corroborated the in vitro differences in MHC-I and TAP gene expression and also revealed important decreases in the expression of key influenza-specific antiviral mediators MX1 and IFITM1. Furthermore, epithelial cell-cytotoxic T lymphocyte co-cultures demonstrate that CTL cytotoxic activity is dose-dependent on MHC-I antigen presentation. Taken together, these results indicate that aging is associated with important changes in the nasal epithelium, including antigen presentation and antiviral pathways, which may contribute to increased severity of disease in older adults through impaired clearance of infected cells.},

abstract = {Several microbes, including Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), a Gram-positive bacterium, live inside the human nasal cavity as commensals. The role of these nasal commensals in host innate immunity is largely unknown, although bacterial interference in the nasal microbiome may promote ecological competition between commensal bacteria and pathogenic species. We demonstrate here that S. epidermidis culture supernatants significantly suppressed the infectivity of various influenza viruses. Using high-performance liquid chromatography together with mass spectrometry, we identified a giant extracellular matrix-binding protein (Embp) as the major component involved in the anti-influenza effect of S. epidermidis. This anti-influenza activity was abrogated when Embp was mutated, confirming that Embp is essential for S. epidermidis activity against viral infection. We also showed that both S. epidermidis bacterial particles and Embp can directly bind to influenza virus. Furthermore, the injection of a recombinant Embp fragment containing a fibronectin-binding domain into embryonated eggs increased the survival rate of virus-infected chicken embryos. For an in vivo challenge study, prior Embp intranasal inoculation in chickens suppressed the viral titres and induced the expression of antiviral cytokines in the nasal tissues. These results suggest that S. epidermidis in the nasal cavity may serve as a defence mechanism against influenza virus infection.},

Adults aged {\^{a}} ‰1 50 years who sought medical care for acute respiratory illness were enrolled. A nose/throat swab was tested for influenza virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical and demographic data were collected, including verification of receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV-3). Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models with an L1 penalty on all covariates except vaccination status. Results. A total of 1047 subjects were enrolled from November through April during 5 influenza seasons during 2006-2012, excluding the 2009-2010 season. Of those enrolled, 927 (88{\%}) had complete influenza virus testing, vaccination status, and demographic data obtained. Of 86 (9.3{\%}) influenza virus-positive patients, 47 (55{\%}) were vaccinated. Of 841 influenza virus-negative patients, 646 (76.8{\%}) were vaccinated. Over 5 influenza seasons, IIV-3 was 58.4{\%} effective (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 37.0{\%}-75.6{\%}) for the prevention of medically attended laboratory-confirmed influenza illness in adults aged {\^{a}} ‰1 50 years and 58.4{\%} effective (95{\%} CI, 7.9{\%}-81.1{\%}) in adults aged {\^{a}} ‰1 65 years.

abstract = {Background: After the 1968 H3N2 pandemic emerged in humans, H3N2 influenza viruses continuously circulated and evolved in nature. An H3N2 variant was circulating in humans in the 1990s and subsequently introduced into the pig population in the 2000s. This virus gradually became the main subtype of swine influenza virus worldwide. However, there were no reports of infections in dogs with this virus. Findings: In 2013, 35 nasal swabs from pet dogs were positive for Influenza A virus by RT-PCR. Two viruses were isolated and genetically characterized. In the phylogenetic trees of all gene segments, two H3N2 canine isolates clustered with Moscow/10/99 and most H3N2 swine influenza viruses. These results indicated that two H3N2 CIVs possessed high homology with human/swine influenza viruses, which at the same time exhibited some amino acid substitutions in NA, polymerase basic protein 1(PB1), and nucleoprotein (NP), which probably were related to the interspecies transmission. Conclusions: These two viruses share the highest homology with swine H3N2, Moscow/99-like viruses, which indicated that these viruses might originate from swine viruses.},

abstract = {Background: Viral respiratory tract infections increase the risk of development and exacerbation of atopic disease. Previously, we demonstrated the requirement for a neutrophil (PMN) subset expressing CD49d to drive development of postviral atopic airway disease in mice. Objective: We sought to determine whether human CD49d+ PMNs are present in the nasal mucosa during acute viral respiratory tract infections and further characterize this PMN subset in human subjects and mice. Methods: Sixty subjects (5-50 years old) were enrolled within 4 days of acute onset of upper respiratory symptoms. Nasal lavage for flow cytometry and nasal swabs for viral PCR were performed at enrollment and during convalescence. The Sendai virus mouse model was used to investigate the phenotype and functional relevance of CD49d+ PMNs. Results: CD49d+ PMN frequency was significantly higher in nasal lavage fluid during acute respiratory symptoms in all subjects (2.9{\%} vs 1.0{\%}, n = 42, P {\textless}.001). In mice CD49d+ PMNs represented a “proatopic” neutrophil subset that expressed cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) and produced TNF, CCL2, and CCL5. Inhibition of CysLTR1 signaling in the first days of a viral respiratory tract infection was sufficient to reduce accumulation of CD49d+ PMNs in the lungs and development of postviral atopic airway disease. Similar to the mouse, human CD49d+ PMNs isolated from nasal lavage fluid during a viral respiratory tract infection expressed CysLTR1. Conclusion: CD49d and CysLTR1–coexpressing PMNs are present during symptoms of an acute viral respiratory tract infection in human subjects. Further study is needed to examine selective targeting of proatopic neutrophils as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent development of postviral atopic airway disease.},

abstract = {Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection has been shown to play an integral role in the development and prognosis of various head and neck cancers. Generational changes in sexual behavior may have led to an increased incidence of positivity in recent years. HPV positivity in both benign and malignant lesions of the sinonasal cavities has been shown in previous studies (estimates range from 20{\%}–30{\%} for malignancy). We intend to investigate if HPV positivity affected survival outcomes in our patient cohort. Methods/Materials: Twenty-six patients diagnosed pathologically for sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with available archived biopsy specimens were retrospectively analyzed to obtain HPV status using a real-time, multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects and quantifies 15 known high-risk HPV types. Demographic information was collected, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results: Sixteen of 26 (62{\%}) SCC tumors in the patient cohort were positive for HPV DNA. HPV types 16 and 18 were the most common (n = 8 and 2, respectively), although a wide range of HPV types across the 15 tested were positive. Survival analyses showed a statistically significant survival advantage (median survival of 12 vs. 54 months) when accounting for HPV positivity using log-rank testing (P {\textless} 0.003). Conclusion: HPV positivity appears to be present in a significant proportion of squamous cell carcinoma cases of the nasal cavity. In our limited patient population there does appear to be a survival advantage to HPV positivity. Further prospective, multi-institutional trials with standardized treatment protocols are needed to elucidate the true impact of HPV positivity in this subset of head and neck cancers.

abstract = {Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children under 1 y of age in the USA. The host immune response is believed to contribute to RSV-induced disease. We hypothesize that severe RSV infection in infants is mediated by insufficient regulation of the host immune response of regulatory T cells (Tregs) resulting in immunopathology. Methods: Blood and nasal aspirates from 23 RSV-infected and 17 control infants under 1 y of age were collected. Treg frequencies were determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analysis of 24 cytokines was measured by multiplex assay on nasal aspirates. Results: We demonstrate that the frequency of activated Tregs is significantly reduced in the peripheral blood of RSV-infected infants compared with age-matched controls. Surprisingly, T helper (Th)17 related cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, IL-17A, and IL-23 were associated with a reduction in clinical symptoms of respiratory distress. In addition, the amount of IL-33 protein in nasal washes, a cytokine important in maintaining Treg homeostasis in mucosal tissues, was decreased in RSV-infected children. Conclusion: These results suggest that decreased Treg numbers and an inability to properly control the host inflammatory response results in severe RSV infection.},

abstract = {Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral cause of pneumonia in children. RSV-specific antibody (ab) protects infants from disease, and may be increased by a potential strategy of maternal RSV vaccination. Objectives To describe the effect of RSV antibody on RSV infection risk in infants in a resource-limited setting. Study design In a prospective study in Nepal, women were enrolled during pregnancy and maternal and infant cord blood were collected at birth. Weekly surveillance for respiratory illness was performed from birth to 180 days. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV by PCR and serum was tested using an RSV antibody microneutralization assay. Antibody concentrations at time of RSV infection were estimated based on a decay rate of 0.026 log2/day. Results Cord:maternal RSV antibody transfer ratio was 1.03 (0.88–1.19), with RSV antibody concentration of log2 11.3 and log2 11.7 in 310 paired maternal and infant samples, respectively. Cord blood RSV antibody was log2 12.1 versus 11.6 in those with or without RSV infection (P = 0.86). Among infants with RSV infection, estimated RSV antibody concentration at time of infection did not differ in infants with upper (n = 8; log2 10.7) versus lower respiratory tract infection (n = 21; log2 9.8; P = 0.37). Cord blood RSV antibody concentrations did not correlate with age at primary RSV infection (R = 0.11; P = 0.57). Conclusions Transplacental transfer of RSV antibody from mother to the fetus was highly efficient in mother-infant pairs in rural Nepal, though higher antibody concentrations were not protective against earlier or more severe RSV infection in infants.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the World Health Organization (WHO)-reported elimination of measles in Australia, importation of cases especially in travellers from Asia continues in Sydney, Australia's largest city. Laboratory confirmation supports clinico-epidemiological evidence of measles virus infection, and is needed to establish elimination. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of a random access real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using the moderate complexity SmartCycler{\textregistered} platform, and measles antigen detection by immunofluorescence (IFA), for the detection of measles virus in patient samples. Study design: One hundred samples comprising nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and urine, collected from patients with suspected measles were tested in parallel using IFA and nucleic acid testing using the SmartCycler{\textregistered} and LightCycler{\textregistered} RT-PCR platforms. The LightCycler{\textregistered} RT-PCR was used as the reference assay against which the SmartCycler{\textregistered} RT-PCR and IFA were compared. Results: Using the LightCycler{\textregistered} RT-PCR, measles virus was detected in 35 clinical samples. There was 100{\%} concordance between the results of the SmartCycler{\textregistered} and the LightCycler{\textregistered}-based RT-PCR. Measles genotypes detected included B3, D8, and D9. Testing urine in addition to NTS did not improve diagnostic yield. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of IFA compared to the reference LightCycler{\textregistered} RT-PCR was 34.3{\%} and 96.7{\%}, respectively. Conclusion: The performance of the SmartCycler{\textregistered} is comparable to the LightCycler{\textregistered} for the detection of measles virus. However, IFA had poor sensitivity and should not be used to confirm measles virus infection where nucleic acid testing is available.},

abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus detection using nasopharyngeal swabs has been suggested as a potential screening test that could improve the specificity of current EBV-based serological assays. However, application requires insertion of the swab deep into the nasopharynx, a procedure not amenable to non-clinic screening. We reasoned that swabbing the more easily accessible nasal cavity might provide an appealing alternative for NPC detection. Patients {\textgreater} 18 years of age diagnosed with histologically confirmed NPC were recruited from the Otolaryngology Department at the National Taiwan University Hospital. ENT clinicians collected both nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. EBV DNA and cellular beta-globulin DNA were quantified using quantitative PCR targeting a highly-conserved region of the BKRF1 gene. EBV DNA was detectable (non-zero) in all 34 nasopharyngeal swabs and above the positivity threshold of 1666 EBV copies in 30 (88.2{\%}) patients. EBV DNA was detectable in 50{\%} of 34 nasal swabs and above the positivity threshold in four (11.8{\%}) patients. Average EBV DNA levels were {\textgreater}3-fold higher (P {\textless} 0.001) in nasopharyngeal compared to nasal swabs. Among the 17 NPC patients with detectable EBV DNA in both swab types, we observed correlation (P {\textless} 0.01) between EBV DNA measurements. Our data represent the first evaluation of EBV DNA collected from nasal swabs. Given current EBV DNA amplification techniques, nasopharyngeal swabs remain more sensitive than nasal swabs for NPC detection.},

abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), resulting in defective anion transport. Regardless of the disease-causing mutation, gene therapy is a strategy to restore anion transport to airway epithelia. Indeed, viral vector-delivered CFTR can complement the anion channel defect. In this proof-of-principle study, functional in vivo CFTR channel activity was restored in the airways of CF pigs using a feline immunodeficiency virus-based (FIV-based) lentiviral vector pseudotyped with the GP64 envelope. Three newborn CF pigs received aerosolized FIV-CFTR to the nose and lung. Two weeks after viral vector delivery, epithelial tissues were analyzed for functional correction. In freshly excised tracheal and bronchus tissues and cultured ethmoid sinus cells, we observed a significant increase in transepithelial cAMP-stimulated current, evidence of functional CFTR. In addition, we observed increases in tracheal airway surface liquid pH and bacterial killing in CFTR vector-treated animals. Together, these data provide the first evidence to our knowledge that lentiviral delivery of CFTR can partially correct the anion channel defect in a large-animal CF model and validate a translational strategy to treat or prevent CF lung disease.},

abstract = {Thirty-two Holstein cows were allocated to receive intranasal vaccination with modified live bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3 V) vaccine either two weeks prior to their projected calving date, or within 24 h after calving. Nasal secretions were collected twice at a 12-h interval on the day prior to vaccination (day 0) and at 2, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days post vaccination to measure interferon (IFN) alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and BHV-1-specific IgA by ELISA. Serum neutralizing antibody titers to BHV-1 and BRSV were measured on days 0, 7, and 14. There was a significant treatment effect (p {\textless} 0.0004) and interaction (p {\textless} 0.05) on nasal BHV-1 IgA levels, with higher IgA levels in cows vaccinated within 24 h after calving. There was a significant treatment effect on nasal IFN-gamma concentration (p {\textless} 0.05) and on nasal total IFN concentration (p {\textless} 0.05), with higher IFN-gamma and total IFN concentrations seen in cows vaccinated within 24 h after calving. There was no significant treatment or interaction effect on nasal IFN-alpha or IFN-beta concentrations, or on serum neutralizing titers to BRSV. In spite of prior viral vaccination during the previous lactation, cows vaccinated on the day of calving responded to an intranasal viral vaccination with increased concentrations of IFN-gamma and increased titers of IgA following vaccination which was significantly higher than cows vaccinated precalving. This study is the first to examine respiratory mucosal responses in immunologically mature dairy cattle vaccinated intranasally before and after calving.},

abstract = {Purpose. Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are responsible for over 2.8 million deaths per year worldwide with pathobiont carriage a required precursor to infection. We sought to determine carriage epidemiology for both bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens as part of a large population-based cross-sectional carriage study. Methodology. Nose self-swab samples were collected in two separate time-points, May to August 2012 (late spring/summer) and February to April 2013 (winter/early spring). The presence of six bacterial species: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and N. meningitidis in addition to respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses A and B, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–3 and adenovirus was determined using culture and PCR methods. Results/Key findings. Carriage was shown to vary with age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. Spatial structures of microbial communities were more disordered in the 0–4 age group and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2=20.42, P=0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed in summer samples and from older individuals but not in the winter or younger individuals (0–4 years), suggesting the presence of seasonal and age-dependent niche processes in respiratory community assembly. Conclusion. The application of epidemiological methods and ecological theory to respiratory tract samples has yielded novel insights into the factors that drive microbial community composition.},

abstract = {Purpose This study was established to provide direct evidence on the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in older adults in two cities in Jiangsu Province, China, and the potential impact of acute respiratory infections on frailty. Participants The cohort was enrolled in Suzhou and Yancheng, two cities in Jiangsu Province in Eastern China. Between November 2015 and March 2016, we enrolled 1532 adults who were 60-89 years of age, and collected blood samples along with baseline data on demographics, general health, chronic diseases, functional status and cognitive function through face-to-face interviews using a standardised questionnaire. Participants are being followed weekly throughout the year to identify acute respiratory illnesses. We schedule home visits to ill participants to collect mid-turbinate nasal and oropharyngeal swabs for laboratory testing and detailed symptom information for the acute illness. Regular follow-up including face-to-face interviews and further blood draws will take place every 6-12 months. Findings to date As of 3 September 2016, we had identified 339 qualifying acute respiratory illness events and 1463 (95{\%}) participants remained in the study. Laboratory testing is ongoing. Future plans We plan to conduct laboratory testing to estimate the incidence of influenza virus and RSV infections in older adults. We plan to investigate the impact of these infections on frailty and functional status to determine the association of pre-existing immune status with protection against influenza and RSV infection in unvaccinated older adults, and to assess the exposure to avian influenza viruses in this population.},

abstract = {Summary Objectives Hypopharyngeal cancer is a subset of head neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with particularly poor prognosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for some HNSCC, and its presence is of prognostic value for certain subsites. However, its influence on survival in hypopharyngeal cancer has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we examine HPV DNA and p16INK4a (p16) overexpression in relation to clinical outcome. Materials and Methods Hypopharyngeal tumour biopsies from 82 patients diagnosed 2008-2013 were examined for presence of HPV DNA by a bead-based multiplex assay and for p16 expression by immunohistochemistry, and the obtained data compared to that acquired previously from 109 patients diagnosed 2000-2007 at the same clinic. A survival analysis was then performed on 142 patients (from both studies) treated with curative intent and a 3-year follow-up time. Results Of the tumour biopsies 3/82 (3.7{\%}) were HPV16 DNA and p16 positive, while 12/82 (14.6{\%}) were p16 positive, equivalent to that in the previous study. Overall 3-year survival was significantly more favourable for patients with HPV16 DNA and p16 positive tumours as compared to survival of the other patients (86{\%} vs. 31{\%}, p = 0.0185). A similar but not statistically significant trend was found for disease specific survival. Conclusion HPV DNA and p16 positive hypopharyngeal cancer was rare and had not increased, but had a better clinical outcome as compared to other HPV-unrelated hypopharyngeal cancer. In addition, p16 overexpression was not a suitable surrogate marker for presence of HPV or for prediction of survival in this type of cancer.},

abstract = {Background: The prevalence, symptom course, and shedding in persons infected with the 4 most common human coronaviruses (HCoV)-229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 are poorly described. Objectives: We estimate their prevalence and associated symptoms among college students identified via a social network study design. Patients/Methods: We collected 1-3 samples (n = 250 specimens) from 176 participants between October 2012 and January 17, 2013: participants with acute respiratory infection (ARI; cough and body aches or chills or fever/feverishness) and their social contacts. Virus was detected using RT-PCR. Results: 30.4{\%} (76/250) of specimens tested positive for any virus tested, and 4.8{\%} (12/250) were positive for 2 or more viruses. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs [22.0{\%}; 55/250]), rhinovirus (7.6{\%}; 19/250), and influenza A (6.4{\%}; 16/250) were most prevalent. Symptoms changed significantly over time among ARI participants with HCoV: the prevalence of cough and chills decreased over 6 days (P =.04, and P =.01, respectively), while runny nose increased over the same period (P =.02). HCoV-NL63 was the most frequent virus detected 6 days following symptom onset (8.9{\%}), followed by rhinovirus (6.7{\%}). Conclusions: During a 3-month period covering a single season, HCoVs were common, even among social contacts without respiratory symptoms; specific symptoms may change over the course of HCoV-associated illness and were similar to symptoms from influenza and rhinovirus.},

abstract = {Spillover of viruses from bats to other animals may be associated with increased contact between them, as well as increased shedding of viruses by bats. Here, we tested the prediction that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) co-infected with the M. lucifugus coronavirus (Myl-CoV) and with Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), the fungus that causes bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), exhibit different disease severity, viral shedding and molecular responses than bats infected with only Myl-CoV or only P. destructans. We took advantage of the natural persistence of Myl-CoV in bats that were experimentally inoculated with P. destructans in a previous study. Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence. Levels of coronavirus antibodies were also higher in fungal-infected bats. Our results suggest that the systemic effects of WNS may down-regulate anti-viral responses in bats persistently infected with M. lucifugus coronavirus and increase the potential of virus shedding.},

abstract = {Background To construct evidence-based guidelines for management of febrile illness, it is essential to identify clinical predictors for the main causes of fever, either to diagnose the disease when no laboratory test is available or to better target testing when a test is available. The objective was to investigate clinical predictors of several diseases in a cohort of febrile children attending outpatient clinics in Tanzania, whose diagnoses have been established after extensive clinical and laboratory workup. Method From April to December 2008, 1005 consecutive children aged 2 months to 10 years with temperature ≥38°C attending two outpatient clinics in Dar es Salaam were included. Demographic characteristics, symptoms and signs, comorbidities, full blood count and liver enzyme level were investigated by bi- and multi-variate analyses (Chan, et al., 2008). To evaluate accuracy of combined predictors to construct algorithms, classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were also performed. Results 62 variables were studied. Between 4 and 15 significant predictors to rule in (aLR+{\textgreater}1) or rule out (aLR+{\textless}1) the disease were found in the multivariate analysis for the 7 more frequent outcomes. For malaria, the strongest predictor was temperature ≥40°C (aLR+8.4, 95{\%}CI 4.7-15), for typhoid abdominal tenderness (5.9, 2.5-11), for urinary tract infection (UTI) age ≥3 years (0.20, 0-0.50), for radiological pneumonia abnormal chest auscultation (4.3, 2.8- 6.1), for acute HHV6 infection dehydration (0.18, 0-0.75), for bacterial disease (any type) chest indrawing (19, 8.2-60) and for viral disease (any type) jaundice (0.28, 0.16-0.41). Other clinically relevant and easy to assess predictors were also found: malaria could be ruled in by recent travel, typhoid by jaundice, radiological pneumonia by very fast breathing and UTI by fever duration of ≥4 days. The CART model for malaria included temperature, travel, jaundice and hepatomegaly (sensitivity 80{\%}, specificity 64{\%}); typhoid: age ≥2 years, jaundice, abdominal tenderness and adenopathy (46{\%}, 93{\%}); UTI: age {\textless}2 years, temperature ≥40°C, low weight and pale nails (20{\%}, 96{\%}); radiological pneumonia: very fast breathing, chest indrawing and leukocytosis (38{\%}, 97{\%}); acute HHV6 infection: less than 2 years old, (no) dehydration, (no) jaundice and (no) rash (86{\%}, 51{\%}); bacterial disease: chest indrawing, chronic condition, temperature ≥39.7°c and fever duration {\textgreater}3 days (45{\%}, 83{\%}); viral disease: runny nose, cough and age {\textless}2 years (68{\%}, 76{\%}). Conclusion A better understanding of the relative performance of these predictors might be of great help for clinicians to be able to better decide when to test, treat, refer or simply observe a sick child, in order to decrease morbidity and mortality, but also to avoid unnecessary antimicrobial prescription. These predictors have been used to construct a new algorithm for the management of childhood illnesses called ALMANACH.},

abstract = {We need greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying protection against influenza virus to develop more effective vaccines. To do this, we need better, more reproducible methods of sampling the nasal mucosa. The aim of the current study was to compare levels of influenza virus A subtype-specific IgA collected using three different methods of nasal sampling. Samples were collected from healthy adult volunteers before and after LAIV immunization by nasal wash, flocked swabs and Synthetic Absorptive Matrix (SAM) strips. Influenza A virus subtype-specific IgA levels were measured by haemagglutinin binding ELISA or haemagglutinin binding microarray and the functional response was assessed by microneutralization. Nasosorption using SAM strips lead to the recovery of a more concentrated sample of material, with a significantly higher level of total and influenza H1-specific IgA. However, an equivalent percentage of specific IgA was observed with all sampling methods when normalized to the total IgA. Responses measured using a recently developed antibody microarray platform, which allows evaluation of binding to multiple influenza strains simultaneously with small sample volumes, were compared to ELISA. There was a good correlation between ELISA and microarray values. Material recovered from SAM strips was weakly neutralizing when used in an in vitro assay, with a modest correlation between the level of IgA measured by ELISA and neutralization, but a greater correlation between microarray-measured IgA and neutralizing activity. In conclusion we have tested three different methods of nasal sampling and show that flocked swabs and novel SAM strips are appropriate alternatives to traditional nasal washes for assessment of mucosal influenza humoral immunity.},

abstract = {The human A/Port Chalmers/1/73 (H3N2) influenza virus strain, the supposed ancestor of European H3N2 swine influenza viruses (SIVs), was used in most commercial SIV vaccines in Europe until recently. If manufacturers want to update vaccine strains, they have to perform laborious intratracheal (IT) challenge experiments and demonstrate reduced virus titres in the lungs of vaccinated pigs. We aimed to examine (a) the ability of a Port Chalmers/73-based commercial vaccine to induce cross-protection against a contemporary European H3N2 SIV and serologic cross-reaction against H3N2 SIVs from Europe and North America and (b) the validity of intranasal (IN) challenge and virus titrations of nasal swabs as alternatives for IT challenge and titrations of lung tissue in vaccine potency tests. Pigs were vaccinated with Suvaxyn Flu{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\textregistered}{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and challenged by the IT or IN route with sw/Gent/172/08. Post-vaccination sera were examined in haemagglutination-inhibition assays against vaccine and challenge strains and additional H3N2 SIVs from Europe and North America, including an H3N2 variant virus. Tissues of the respiratory tract and nasal swabs were collected 3 days post challenge (DPCh) and from 0-7 DPCh, respectively, and examined by virus titration. Two vaccinations consistently induced cross-reactive antibodies against European H3N2 SIVs from 1998-2012, but minimal or undetectable antibody titres against North American viruses. Challenge virus titres in the lungs, trachea and nasal mucosa of the vaccinated pigs were significantly reduced after both IT and IN challenge. Yet the reduction of virus titres and nasal shedding was greater after IT challenge. The Port Chalmers/73-based vaccine still offered protection against a European H3N2 SIV isolated 35 years later and with only 86.9{\%} amino acid homology in its HA1, but it is unlikely to protect against H3N2 SIVs that are endemic in North America. We use our data to reflect on vaccine strain updates and on the vaccine potency test.},

abstract = {Objective To determine the rate of sinusitis complicating upper respiratory tract illnesses (URIs) in children. We prospectively identified the clinical, virologic, and epidemiologic characteristics of URIs in a population of 4- to 7-year-old children followed for 1 year. Study design This was an observational cohort study in 2 primary care pediatric practices in Madison, Wisconsin. Nasal samples were obtained during 4 asymptomatic surveillance visits and during symptomatic URIs. A polymerase chain reaction-based assay for 9 respiratory viruses was performed on nasal samples. A diagnosis of sinusitis was based on published criteria. Results Two hundred thirty-six children ages 48-96 months were enrolled. A total of 327 URIs were characterized. The mean number of URIs per child was 1.3 (range 0-9) per year. Viruses were detected in 81{\%} of URIs; rhinovirus (RV) was most common. Seventy-two percent of URIs were resolved clinically by the 10th day. RV-A and RV-C were detected more frequently at URI visits; RV-B was detected at the same rate for both asymptomatic surveillance visits and URI visits. Sinusitis was diagnosed in 8.8{\%} of symptomatic URIs. Viruses were detected frequently (33{\%}) in samples from asymptomatic children. Conclusions Sinusitis occurred in 8.8{\%} of symptomatic URIs in our study. The virus most frequently detected with URIs in children was RV; RV-A and RV-C detection but not RV-B detection were associated with illness. Viruses, especially RV, are detected frequently in asymptomatic children. Most URIs have improved or resolved by the 10th day after onset. Children experienced a mean of 1.3 URIs per year, which was lower than expected.},

abstract = {Mast cell (MC) degranulation is the foundation of the acute phase of allergic rhinitis (AR). Previously, down regulation of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was shown to suppress MC activation in an AR mouse model. Binding of microRNA-135a (miR-135a) to GATA-3 was also observed, and overexpression of this miRNA decreased GATA-3 mRNA and protein expression. However, the effects of miR-135a on MCs during AR are currently unknown. In the present study, we utilized a lentiviral (LV) vector to intranasally administer miR-135a to ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized AR mice. Following miR-135a treatment, the total serum IgE concentration observed during AR was significantly reduced. In the nasal mucosa, the expression of T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) was higher, whereas that of GATA-3 was lower in the AR mice following miRNA treatment. Notably, during AR, the ratio of type 1 T-helper cells (Th1) to type 2 (Th2) cells in the spleen is unbalanced, favoring Th2. However, administering miR-135a to the AR mice appeared to balance this ratio by increasing and decreasing the percentage of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. MiR-135a also appeared to strongly suppress the infiltration of eosinophils and MCs into the nasal mucosa, and it was specifically localized in the MCs, suggesting that its influence is modulated through regulation of GATA-3 in these cells. Additional work identifying the full therapeutic potential of miR-135a in the treatment of AR and diseases involving allergen-induced inflammation is warranted.},

The excretion and persistence of contagious ZIKV in various body fluids have been well documented in ZIKV patients; however, the risk of direct contact exposure remains unclear. Here, we show that Guinea pigs are susceptible to ZIKV infection via subcutaneous inoculation route; infected Guinea pigs exhibit seroconversion and significant viral secretion in sera, saliva, and tears. Notably, ZIKV is efficiently transmitted from infected Guinea pigs to na{\"{i}}ve co-caged animals. In particular, intranasal inoculation of ZIKV is fully capable of establishing infection in Guinea pigs, and viral antigens are detected in multiple tissues including brain and parotid glands. Cynomolgus macaques also efficiently acquire ZIKV infection via intranasal and intragastric inoculation routes. These collective results from animal models highlight the risk of exposure to ZIKV contaminants and raise the possibility of close contact transmission of ZIKV in humans.},

abstract = {Purpose: Despite the advent of concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), the prognosis of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients remains particularly poor. Classically, HNSCC, especially oropharyngeal carcinomas, associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) exhibits better treatment outcomes than HNSCCs in non-infected patients, eliciting a call for the de-escalation of current therapies. To improve the management of HNSCC patients, we aimed to determine the impact of active HPV infection on patient response, recurrence and survival after CCRT in a population of heavy tobacco and alcohol consumers. Methods: Paraffin-embedded samples from 218 advanced HNSCC patients, mostly smokers and/or drinkers treated by CCRT, were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by surrogate type-specific E6/E7 qPCR and p16 immunohistochemistry. Associations between the response to CCRT and patient outcomes according to HPV status and clinical data were evaluated by Kaplan–Meier analysis and both univariate and multivariate Cox regression. Results: Type-specific E6/E7 PCR demonstrated HPV positivity in 20 {\%} of HNSCC. Regarding HPV status, we did not find any significant relation with response to therapy in terms of progression-free survival or overall survival. However, we observed a significantly worse prognosis for consumers of alcohol and tobacco compared to nondrinkers (p = 0.003) and non-smokers (p = 0.03). Survival analyses also revealed that the outcome is compromised in stage IV patients (p = 0.007) and, in particular, for oral cavity, hypopharynx and oropharynx carcinoma patients (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The risk of death from HNSCC significantly increases when patients are exposed to tobacco and alcohol during their therapy, regardless of HPV status.},

Its fusion (F) protein is critical for virus infection. It is targeted by several investigational antivirals and by palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody used prophylactically in infants considered at high risk of severe RSV disease. ALX-0171 is a trimeric Nanobody that binds the antigenic site II of RSV F protein with subnanomolar affinity. ALX-0171 demonstrated in vitro neutralization superior to that of palivizumab against prototypic RSV subtype A and B strains. Moreover, ALX-0171 completely blocked replication to below the limit of detection for 87{\%} of the viruses tested, whereas palivizumab did so for 18{\%} of the viruses tested at a fixed concentration. Importantly, ALX-0171 was highly effective in reducing both nasal and lung RSV titers when delivered prophylactically or therapeutically directly to the lungs of cotton rats. ALX-0171 represents a potent novel antiviral compound with significant potential to treat RSV-mediated disease.},

abstract = {Introduction: The distribution of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) is highly inhomogeneous throughout the world. In Sub-Saharan Africa, despite the precocity of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and its endemicity, ENKTCL remains exceptionally reported. The purpose of this study was to report the epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical, and evolutionary characteristics of ENKTCL at the Aristide LeDantec University Hospital in Dakar, Senegal. Methodology: A 5-year retrospective review of all patients with histopathological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization proven cutaneous lymphomas. Results: We collected seven cases corresponding to a frequency of 1.4 cases per year. ENKTCL accounted for 10.5{\%} of all cutaneous lymphomas, ranking second after T-cell lymphomas. Men were predominantly affected (M : F ratio of 6), and the mean age was 38.5 years ± 4.06. The mean time before consultation was 7.3 months. The lymphomas affected primarily the nasal cavity in five cases and the skin in two cases. At admission, six patients had nasal mucosa involvement, which was isolated in three cases, associated with cutaneous lesions in three cases and lymph node involvement in three cases. CD56 was positive in only one case, and Eber transcribed RNA of EBV was expressed by in situ hybridization in all patients. Discussion: To our knowledge, we have reported the first and largest series of ENKTCL in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our study shows an intermediate prevalence between that reported from Asia, Latin America, and the West. It was also noted a young age of patients, a prolonged diagnostic delay, a frequent negativity of CD56 marker, and a very poor prognosis of the disease in our region.},

abstract = {Background: Four sampling techniques commonly are used for antemortem identification of pathogens from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD): the nasal swab (NS), guarded nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and transtracheal wash (TTW). Agreement among these methods has not been well characterized. Objective: To evaluate agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL for identification of viral and bacterial pathogens in dairy calves with BRD. Animals: One hundred dairy calves with naturally acquired BRD. Methods: Calves were sampled by all 4 methods. Viral agents were identified by real-time RT-PCR, bacteria were identified by aerobic culture, and Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) isolates were speciated by PCR. Agreement among TTW and NS, NPS, or BAL was evaluated by calculating the kappa statistic and percent positive agreement. McNemar's exact test was used to compare the proportions of positive results. Results: Agreement among TTW and NS, TTW and NPS, and TTW and BAL, was very good for identification of P. multocida, M. haemolytica, and M. bovis. For bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS, good for NPS, and very good for BAL. For bovine coronavirus (BCV), agreement with TTW was moderate for NS and NPS, and good for BAL. McNemar's test was significant only for BCV, indicating that for this pathogen the proportion of positive results from NS and NPS could not be considered comparable to TTW. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study provides guidance for veterinarians selecting diagnostic tests for antemortem identification of pathogens associated with BRD.},

abstract = {Background: Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are a nidus for exacerbation of infectious conditions including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Resistance of biofilms to current therapeutics stresses the need for the development of novel anti-biofilm strategies. The chimeric muralytic enzyme P128 was specifically engineered to target Staphylococcal sp. by combining the cell wall binding domain of lysostaphin and the peptidoglycan-degrading murein hydrolase derived from phage K. This study assessed the anti-biofilm activity of P128 against sinus-derived S. aureus. Methods: Biofilms from S. aureus ATCC 25923 and 3 sinus-derived methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant CRS clinical isolates were grown for 48 hours and treated with various concentrations of P128 (0 to 100 $\mu$g/mL) for 2 and 24 hours, using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay and Alamar Blue (AB) assay. Biofilm present on the MBEC pegs was stained with LIVE/DEAD BacLight stain, imaged using confocal scanning laser microscopy and biomass determined by COMSTAT2 computation. In the AB assay, biofilm was measured by assessing the cell viability. Results were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis test, with a Wilcoxon post hoc test and Bonferroni correction. Results: Both the MBEC and AB assay indicated that P128 was effective against in vitro S. aureus biofilms with significant reductions in biofilm of up to 95.5{\%} at concentrations ≥12.5 $\mu$g/mL for all tested strains. Conclusion: The engineered chimeric endolysin P128 was observed to be an effective anti-biofilm agent against S. aureus. Further study will proceed into the appropriate application of P128 to ensure both an economically and clinically feasible preparation.},

abstract = {Background: Staphylococcus aureus biofilms contribute negatively to a number of chronic conditions, including chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). With the inherent tolerance of biofilm-bound bacteria to antibiotics and the global problem of bacterial antibiotic resistance, the need to develop novel therapeutics is paramount. Phage therapy has previously shown promise in treating sinonasal S. aureus biofilms. Methods: This study investigates the long term (20 days) safety of topical sinonasal flushes with bacteriophage suspensions. The bacteriophage cocktail NOV012 against S. aureus selected for this work contains two highly characterized and different phages, P68 and K710. Host range was assessed against S. aureus strains isolated from CRS patients using agar spot tests. NOV012 was applied topically to the frontal sinus region of sheep, twice daily for 20 days. General sheep wellbeing, mucosal structural changes and inflammatory load were assessed to determine safety of NOV012 application. Results: NOV012 could lyse 52/61 (85{\%}) of a panel of locally derived CRS clinical isolates. Application of NOV012 to the frontal sinuses of sheep for 20 days was found to be safe, with no observed inflammatory infiltration or tissue damage within the sinus mucosa. Conclusion: NOV012 cocktail appears safe to apply for extended periods to sheep sinuses and it could infect and lyse a wide range of S. aureus CRS clinical isolates. This indicates that phage therapy has strong potential as a treatment for chronic bacterial rhinosinusitis.},

abstract = {Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are recognized respiratory pathogens for which accumulating evidence indicates that in vulnerable patients the infection can cause more severe pathologies. HCoVs are not always confined to the upper respiratory tract and can invade the central nervous system (CNS) under still unclear circumstances. HCoV-induced neuropathologies in humans are difficult to diagnose early enough to allow therapeutic interventions. Making use of our already described animal model of HCoV neuropathogenesis, we describe the route of neuropropagation from the nasal cavity to the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex and then the brain stem. We identified neuron-to-neuron propagation as one underlying mode of virus spreading in cell culture. Our data demonstrate that both passive diffusion of released viral particles and axonal transport are valid propagation strategies used by the virus. We describe for the first time the presence along axons of viral platforms whose static dynamism is reminiscent of viral assembly sites. We further reveal that HCoV OC43 modes of propagation can be modulated by selected HCoV OC43 proteins and axonal transport. Our work, therefore, identifies processes that may govern the severity and nature of HCoV OC43 neuropathogenesis and will make possible the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent occurrences. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses may invade the CNS, disseminate, and participate in the induction of neurological diseases. Their neuropathogenicity is being increasingly recognized in humans, and the presence and persistence of human coronaviruses (HCoV) in human brains have been proposed to cause long-term sequelae. Using our mouse model relying on natural susceptibility to HCoV OC43 and neuronal cell cultures, we have defined the most relevant path taken by HCoV OC43 to access and spread to and within the CNS toward the brain stem and spinal cord and studied in cell culture the underlying modes of intercellular propagation to better understand its neuropathogenesis. Our data suggest that axonal transport governs HCoV OC43 egress in the CNS, leading to the exacerbation of neuropathogenesis. Exploiting knowledge on neuroinvasion and dissemination will enhance our ability to control viral infection within the CNS, as it will shed light on underlying mechanisms of neuropathogenesis and uncover potential druggable molecular virus-host interfaces. },

abstract = {Here we present two cases of human infection with cowpox virus with distinct clinical courses. A series of clinical photographs documents lesion progression over time. In the first case—an unvaccinated young veterinary assistant—a pustule was treated locally with cortisone. The lesion turned into a large ulcer accompanied by severe lymphadenitis. Based on her close contact to a sick stray cat, infection with cowpox virus was assumed and confirmed by virus isolation, PCR, and serology. The clinical course took up to eleven months until healing of the wound was complete. Transmission of cowpox virus from the cat was likely because a skin swab was PCR-positive and the cat had a high titer of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies. In contrast, a rather mild clinical course of cowpox was confirmed in a 49-year-old male farmer vaccinated against smallpox. Only a small eschar developed, and wound closure was complete after 6 weeks.},

abstract = {Pteropid bats or flying-foxes (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) are the natural host of Hendra virus (HeV) which sporadically causes fatal disease in horses and humans in eastern Australia. While there is strong evidence that urine is an important infectious medium that likely drives bat to bat transmission and bat to horse transmission, there is uncertainty about the relative importance of alternative routes of excretion such as nasal and oral secretions, and faeces. Identifying the potential routes of HeV excretion in flying-foxes is important to effectively mitigate equine exposure risk at the bat-horse interface, and in determining transmission rates in host-pathogen models. The aim of this study was to identify the major routes of HeV excretion in naturally infected flying-foxes, and secondarily, to identify between-species variation in excretion prevalence. A total of 2840 flying-foxes from three of the four Australian mainland species (Pteropus alecto, P. poliocephalus and P. scapulatus) were captured and sampled at multiple roost locations in the eastern states of Queensland and New South Wales between 2012 and 2014. A range of biological samples (urine and serum, and urogenital, nasal, oral and rectal swabs) were collected from anaesthetized bats, and tested for HeV RNA using a qRT-PCR assay targeting the M gene. Forty-two P. alecto (n = 1410) had HeV RNA detected in at least one sample, and yielded a total of 78 positive samples, at an overall detection rate of 1.76{\%} across all samples tested in this species (78/4436). The rate of detection, and the amount of viral RNA, was highest in urine samples ({\textgreater}serum, packed haemocytes {\textgreater}faecal {\textgreater}nasal {\textgreater}oral), identifying urine as the most plausible source of infection for flying-foxes and for horses. Detection in a urine sample was more efficient than detection in urogenital swabs, identifying the former as the preferred diagnostic sample. The detection of HeV RNA in serum is consistent with haematogenous spread, and with hypothesised latency and recrudesence in flying-foxes. There were no detections in P. poliocephalus (n = 1168 animals; n = 2958 samples) or P. scapulatus (n = 262 animals; n = 985 samples), suggesting (consistent with other recent studies) that these species are epidemiologically less important than P. alecto in HeV infection dynamics. The study is unprecedented in terms of the individual animal approach, the large sample size, and the use of a molecular assay to directly determine infection status. These features provide a high level of confidence in the veracity of our findings, and a sound basis from which to more precisely target equine risk mitigation strategies. Copyright:},

Nasal swabs were obtained via self-administered sampling from consenting adults (≥ 16 yearsold) with influenza symptoms who had contacted the National Pandemic Flu Service (NPFS) health line during the 2009 influenza pandemic. Equivalent samples submitted by sentinel general practitioners participating in the national influenza surveillance scheme run jointly by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and Health Protection Agency were also obtained. When comparable samples were analysed there was no significant difference in results obtained from self-sampling and clinician-led sampling schemes. These results demonstrate that selfsampling can be applied in a responsive and flexible manner, to supplement sentinel clinician-based sampling, to achieve a wide spread and geographically representative way of assessing community transmission of a known organism.},

Venous blood and nasal secretions obtained before feeding and at 24 h of age were assayed for total IgG (serum) by radial immunodiffusion and for BRSV-specific total IgG, IgG-1, and IgG-2 by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Calves that were fed a CR had higher concentrations of BRSV-specific IgG and IgG-1 in their serum and nasal secretions compared to calves fed product PR; calves fed the PR had higher levels of serum BRSV-specific IgG-2. The only subclass of antibodies detected in nasal secretions was IgG-1. Re-secretion of passive IgG with neutralizing activity, onto the nasal mucosa could contribute to BRSV-associated disease-sparing observed in the laboratory and in the field.

abstract = {Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is usually secondary to alveolar rupture in the pulmonary interstitium, associated with subcutaneous emphysema and occasionally with pneumothorax, but is rarely associated with pneumorrhachis. The leaked air into the pulmonary perivascular interstitium follows the path of least resistance from the mediastinum to the fascial planes of the neck. Air freely communicates via the neural foramina and collects in the epidural space. Pneumorrhachis is defined as the presence of air in the spinal canal, either in the intradural and/or extradural spaces. It is a very rare clinical entity and mostly asymptomatic, hence most probably underdiagnosed. Many pathological and physiological events can lead to alveolar rupture, and these clinical findings can be related to various, mainly traumatic and iatrogenic etiologies. Herein we report three cases of pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, interstitial emphysema and pneumorrhachis in two cases, which were related to rhinovirus, human bocavirus and respiratory syncytial virus infection.},

The sensitivity of the RVP Fast v2 assay in comparison to qPCR was lower in younger children (42.9{\%} vs. 57.7{\%}; Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.53); in samples with co-infections (40.0{\%} vs. 56.7{\%}; Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.52); and in samples with hAdv type C (45.9{\%} vs. 57.1{\%}; Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.60). Samples with lower viral loads were associated with a significantly lower sensitivity of the RVP Fast v2 assay (35.1{\%} vs. 68.2{\%}, p = 0.01; Cohen's kappa coefficients, 0.49). The RVP Fast v2 assay has important limitations for the detection of hAdv and cannot be used to evaluate whether hAdvs are the main etiologic agent responsible for an outbreak or when epidemiological studies are performed.},

abstract = {Current porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccines sometimes fail to provide adequate immunity to protect pigs from PRRSV-induced disease. This may be due to antigenic differences among PRRSV strains. Rapid production of attenuated farm-specific homologous vaccines is a feasible alternative to commercial vaccines. In this study, attenuation and efficacy of a codon-pair de-optimized candidate vaccine generated by synthetic attenuated virus engineering approach (SAVE5) were tested in a conventional growing pig model. Forty pigs were vaccinated intranasally or intramuscularly with SAVE5 at day 0 (D0). The remaining 28 pigs were sham-vaccinated with saline. At D42, 30 vaccinated and 19 sham-vaccinated pigs were challenged with the homologous PRRSV strain VR2385. The experiment was terminated at D54. The SAVE5 virus was effectively attenuated as evidenced by a low magnitude of SAVE5 viremia for 1–5 consecutive weeks in 35.9{\%} (14/39) of the vaccinated pigs, lack of detectable nasal SAVE5 shedding and failure to transmit the vaccine virus from pig to pig. By D42, all vaccinated pigs with detectable SAVE5 viremia also had detectable anti-PRRSV IgG. Anti-IgG positive vaccinated pigs were protected from subsequent VR2385 challenge as evidenced by lack of VR2385 viremia and nasal shedding, significantly reduced macroscopic and microscopic lung lesions and significantly reduced amount of PRRSV antigen in lungs compared to the non-vaccinated VR2385-challenged positive control pigs. The nasal vaccination route appeared to be more effective in inducing protective immunity in a larger number of pigs compared to the intramuscular route. Vaccinated pigs without detectable SAVE5 viremia did not seroconvert and were fully susceptible to VR2385 challenge. Under the study conditions, the SAVE approach was successful in attenuating PRRSV strain VR2385 and protected against homologous virus challenge. Virus dosage likely needs to be adjusted to induce replication and protection in a higher percentage of vaccinated pigs.},

abstract = {Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa and is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1,2]. In order to understand the tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the leading cause of acute respiratory tract disease in children less than 5 years old. The aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular properties and clinical characteristics of RSV infection. The study sample included 238 patients {\textless}5 years old who were hospitalized with clinical symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (URTI or LRTI) in the Pediatric Department at the First People's Hospital of Chenzhou, South China in 2014. We subjected nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) or nasal swab (NS) samples from the patients to indirect fluorescence assay screens. RSV G genes were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequenced. Of the 238 patients screened, 64 (26.8{\%}) were confirmed to have RSV infections. Of those 64 confirmed RSV infection cases, 39 (60.9{\%}) had subtype BA9, 13 (20.3{\%}) had the recently identified subtype ON1, 11 (17.2{\%}) had subtype NA1, and 1 (1.6{\%}) had subtype GB2. The predominant presentation was LRTI with coughing, sputum production, fever, and wheezing. RSV subtype NA1 and BA9 infections were found mostly in infants, whereas the age distribution of subtype ON1 infections was more uniform across the age bands. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that, compared with the prototype strain A2, all ON1 and most NA1 isolates had lost one potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid 251 and 249 due to T251K and N249Y substitution, respectively. These findings suggest that NA1, BA9, and ON1 are the dominant RSV subtypes causing respiratory tract infections in young children presenting to the hospital in South China. J. Med.

abstract = {Viruses transmit via the environmental and social interactions of their hosts. Herpesviruses have colonized mammals since their earliest origins, suggesting that they exploit ancient, common pathways. Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are assumed to enter new hosts orally, but no site has been identified. We show by live imaging that murine CMV (MCMV) infects nasally rather than orally, both after experimental virus uptake and during natural transmission. Replication-deficient virions revealed the primary target as olfactory neurons. Local, nasal replication by wild-type MCMV was not extensive, but there was rapid systemic spread, associated with macrophage infection. A long-term, transmissible infection was then maintained in the salivary glands. The viral m131/m129 chemokine homolog, which influences tropism, promoted salivary gland colonization after nasal entry but was not required for entry per se. The capacity of MCMV to transmit via olfaction, together with previous demonstrations of experimental olfactory infection by murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), suggest that this is a common, conserved route of mammalian herpesvirus entry. IMPORTANCE Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) infect most mammals. Human CMV (HCMV) harms people with poor immune function and can damage the unborn fetus. It infects approximately 1{\%} of live births. We lack a good vaccine. One problem is that how CMVs first enter new hosts remains unclear. Oral entry is often assumed, but the evidence is indirect, and no infection site is known. The difficulty of analyzing HCMV makes related animal viruses an important source of insights. Murine CMV (MCMV) infected not orally but nasally. Specifically, it targeted olfactory neurons. Viral transmission was also a nasal infection. Like HCMV, MCMV infected cells by binding to heparan, and olfactory surfaces display heparan to incoming viruses, whereas most other mucosal surfaces do not. These data establish a new understanding of CMV infections and a basis for infection control.},

At both 33. °C and 37. °C, seasonal influenza virus and an antigenically matched LAIV replicated to similar titers in MDCK cells but seasonal influenza virus replicated to higher titers than LAIV in hNEC cultures, suggesting a greater restriction of LAIV replication in hNEC cultures. Despite the disparity in infectious virus production, the supernatants from H1N1 and LAIV infected hNEC cultures had equivalent amounts of viral proteins and hemagglutination titers, suggesting the formation of non-infectious virus particles by LAIV in hNEC cultures.},

They were challenged on day 40 of gestation with the virulent porcine parvovirus PPV-27a from which the vaccine was prepared (homologous challenge). On day 90 of gestation, the fetuses from vaccinated sows were protected against disease, while the fetuses of the non-vaccinated sows (control group) exhibited signs of parvovirus disease. All gilts, whether vaccinated or not vaccinated, showed a boost of PPVspecific antibodies indicative of virus infection and replication. Low DNA copy numbers, but not infectious virus, could be demonstrated in nasal or rectal swabs of immunized sows, but high copy numbers of challenge virus DNA as well as infectious virus could both be demonstrated in non-vaccinated sows.},

The primary objective of this study was toevaluate the concordance between these 2 diagnostic tests. The secondary objective was to study theclinical characteristics of these patients.Materials and methods: This single-centre prospective study was conducted between February 2010 andJuly 2012. Immunohistochemical analysis of p16 and HPV-PCR were performed on tumour biopsies.Concordance was evaluated according to Cohen's kappa coefficient and was interpreted according to theLandis and Koch scale. The patients' clinical data were analysed as a function of the diagnostic test results.Results: Seventy-one patients were included in this study. The prevalence of HPV was 43.7{\%} accordingto p16 and 31{\%} according to HPV-PCR. The concordance study revealed a kappa coefficient of 0.615. Atumour of the tonsil or base of the tongue was detected in 100{\%} of p16+/HPV-PCR+ cases. Smoking andalcohol abuse were significantly less frequent among HPV+ patients regardless of the method of detection.These patients were older and presented tumours with a lower grade of histological differentiation.Conclusion: p16 immunohistochemistry or HPV-PCR used alone appear to be insufficient. These resultsconfirm the high prevalence of HPV-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and thepreviously reported specific clinical and histological features, apart from age. It appears essential forfuture clinical trials to be stratified according to smoking and tumour HPV status, defined by meansof reliable virological tests targeting E6/E7 mRNA and no longer a simple positive response to the p16marker, as is frequently the case at the present time. New tests suitable for use in routine practice thereforeneed to be developed.},

abstract = {The host innate immune response to influenza virus is a key determinant of pathogenic outcomes and long-term protective immune responses against subsequent exposures. Here, we present a direct contrast of the host responses in primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC) cultures following infection with either a seasonal H3N2 influenza virus (WT) or the antigenically-matched live-attenuated vaccine (LAIV) strain. Comparison of the transcriptional profiles obtained 24 and 36 h post-infection showed that the magnitude of gene expression was greater in LAIV infected relative to that observed in WT infected hNEC cultures. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the antiviral and inflammatory responses were largely driven by type III IFN induction in both WT and LAIV infected cells. However, the enrichment of biological pathways involved in the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes, antigen-presenting cells, and T lymphocytes was uniquely observed in LAIV infected cells. These observations were reflective of the host innate immune responses observed in individuals acutely infected with influenza viruses. These findings indicate that cell-intrinsic type III IFN-mediated innate immune responses in the nasal epithelium are not only crucial for viral clearance and attenuation, but may also play an important role in the induction of protective immune responses with live-attenuated vaccines.},

Diagnostic tests are required to reliably detect this emerging virus, and this report describes the development and evaluation of a novel real-time (r) reverse-transcription (RT) PCR assay (rRT-PCR), targeting the viral polymerase gene (3D) of SVV-1. This new assay detected all historical and contemporary SVV-1 isolates examined (n = 8), while no cross-reactivity was observed with nucleic acid templates prepared from other vesicular disease viruses or common swine pathogens. The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR was 0.79 TCID50/ml and the limit of detection was equivalent using two different rRT-PCR master-mixes. The performance of the test was further evaluated using pig nasal (n = 25) and rectal swab samples (n = 25), where concordant results compared to virus sequencing were generated for 43/50 samples. The availability of this assay, will enable laboratories to rapidly detect SVV-1 in cases of vesicular disease in pigs, negated for notifiable diseases, and could enable existing knowledge gaps to be investigated surrounding the natural epidemiology of SVV-1.},

abstract = {We report the case of a 37-year-old man with human papillomavirus-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx coexisting with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The patient had no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. Within a few months, his rapidly growing tumor was classified as T4aN2cM0. It could be assumed that the rapid increase in the tumor mass, which did not respond positively to treatment, might have been associated with the coexistence of the chronic myelogenous leukemia, which had been found incidentally. Genetic testing revealed the presence of insertion mutation 3020insC within the NOD2 gene, which might be an important genetic predisposing factor, not only for a single tumor such as laryngeal cancer, but also for multiple primary neoplasms. The presence of an NOD2 mutation could significantly worsen the course of the cancer. Therefore, given the relatively high frequency of 3020insC mutations in the general population, it might be reasonable to perform genetic testing on a wider scale for patients with head or neck cancer, particularly in cases that follow an atypical course. It is also worth emphasizing the importance of thorough and periodically repeated laryngeal examinations in patients with chronic leukemia.},

The aim of this study was to develop an aerosol formulation containing an association of the two molecules which could reach the lower respiratory tract. Mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of a resveratrol/CM-glucan combination was lower than that shown by resveratrol or CM-glucan alone (2.83 versus 3.28 and 2.96 $\mu$m, respectively). The resveratrol/CM-glucan association results in the finest and most monodispersed particles in comparison to the two single components. The association also evidenced lower values for all particle size distribution parameters, suggesting that the pharmacological synergy observed in previous studies may be accompanied by a pharmaceutical one. Moreover, we showed that the CM-glucan matrix did not exert an inhibitory effect on resveratrol nebulization, demonstrating the good suitability of these two molecules in association for simultaneous aerosol volatilization.},

abstract = {Cowpox virus (CPXV) is a zoonotic virus and endemic in wild rodent populations in Eurasia. Serological surveys in Europe have reported high prevalence in different vole and mouse species. Here, we report on experimental CPXV infections of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from different evolutionary lineages with a spectrum of CPXV strains. All bank voles, independently of lineage, sex and age, were resistant to clinical signs following CPXV inoculation, and no virus shedding was detected in nasal or buccal swabs. In-contact control animals became only rarely infected. However, depending on the CPXV strain used, inoculated animals seroconverted and viral DNA could be detected preferentially in the upper respiratory tract. The highest antibody titers and virus DNA loads in the lungs were detected after inoculation with two strains from Britain and Finland. We conclude from our experiments that the role of bank voles as an efficient and exclusive CPXV reservoir seems questionable, and that CPXV may be maintained in most regions by other hosts, including other vole species. Further investigations are needed to identify factors that allow and modulate CPXV maintenance in bank voles and other potential reservoirs, which may also influence spill-over infections to accidental hosts.},

abstract = {Background: Whether viral coinfections cause more severe disease than Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) alone remains unclear. We compared clinical disease severity and sought clinical and demographic differences between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with respiratory viral coinfections. We also analyzed how respiratory infections were distributed during the 2 years study. Methods: We enrolled 53 infants with pertussis younger than 180 days (median age 58 days, range 17-109 days, 64.1{\%} boys), hospitalized in the Pediatric Departments at "Sapienza" University Rome and Bambino Ges{\`{u}} Children's Hospital from August 2012 to November 2014. We tested in naso-pharyngeal washings B. pertussis and 14 respiratory viruses with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were obtained from hospital records and demographic characteristics collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: 28/53 infants had B. pertussis alone and 25 viral coinfection: 10 human rhinovirus (9 alone and 1 in coinfection with parainfluenza virus), 3 human coronavirus, 2 respiratory syncytial virus. No differences were observed in clinical disease severity between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and those with coinfections. Infants with B. pertussis alone were younger than infants with coinfections, and less often breastfeed at admission. Conclusions: In this descriptive study, no associations between clinical severity and pertussis with or without co-infections were found.

abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can spread in between pigs via contact and airborne route. It was shown before that the highly pathogenic PRRSV strain Lena was able to replicate 10-100 times more in the nasal mucosa compared to the low pathogenic PRRSV strain LV. In this work, the replication characteristics of four type 1 (LV, 07V063, 08VA, 13V091), three type 2 (VR2332, MN-184, VN) and two attenuated (MLV-DV, MLV-VR2332) PRRSV strains were studied. After 72hpi, mean virus titers reached 104.5-4.8 TCID50/ml for LV and 08VA, 105.2-5.4 TCID50/ml for VR2332 and Lena, and 105.8-6.3 TCID50/ml for 07V063, 13V091, MN-184 and VN strains, whereas attenuated strains remained below detection limit. The mean number of PRRSV-positive cells/mm2 at 72hpi was 1.1 and 1.3 for the attenuated strains and LV, 13.3 for 08VA, 23.5 and 29.3 for VR2332 and 07063, 31.1 and 33.8 for 13V091 and Lena, and, 39.1 and 59.2 for MN-184 and VN respectively. All the LV and MLV-LV infected cells were Sn+, whereas all other strains also infected Sn- macrophages. In conclusion, (i) based on the virus shedding in the respiratory explants, PRRSV strains can be categorized as poor (MLV-DV, MLV-VR2332, LV, 08VA), moderate (Lena, VR2332) and strong (07V063, 13V091, MN-184, VN) secretors, and (ii) based on the number of infected cells isolates can be categorized as low (MLV-DV, MLV-VR2332, LV), moderately (08VA, VR2332), highly (07V063, Lena, 13V091) and hyper (MN-184, VN) virulent in the nasal mucosa.},

abstract = {Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the leading causes of pneumonia among infants with no human vaccine or efficient curative treatments. Efforts are underway to develop new RSV vaccines and therapeutics. There is a dire need for animal models for preclinical evaluation and selection of products against RSV. Herein, we developed a whole body bioluminescence imaging to follow replication of RSV A2 virus strain expressing firefly luciferase (RSVA2-line19-FFL) in live BALB/c mice that can be used as an extremely sensitive readout for studying effects of antiviral and vaccines in living mice. Strong bioluminescence signal was detected in the nasal cavity and in the lungs following intranasal infection of mice with RSVA2-line19-FFL. The kinetics of viral replication in lungs quantified by daily live imaging strongly correlated with viral titers measured by ex-vivo plaque assay and by assessing viral RNA by qRT-PCR. Vaccination of mice with a pre-fusion F protein elicited high neutralizing antibody titers conferring strong protective immunity against virus replication in the nasal cavity and lungs. In contrast, post-challenge treatment of mice with the monoclonal antibody Palivizumab two days after infection reduced viral replication in the nasal cavity at day 4, but only modestly reduced virus loads in the lungs by day 5. In contrast to RSV bioluminescence, plaque assay did not detect viral titers in lungs on day 5 in Palivizumab-treated animals. This difference between viral loads measured by the two assays was found to be due to coating of virions with the Palivizumab that blocked infection of target cells in vitro and shows importance of live imaging in evaluation of RSV therapeutics. This recombinant RSV based live imaging animal model is convenient and valuable tool that can be used to study host dissemination of RSV and evaluation of antiviral compounds and vaccines against RSV.},

The adjuvanted G protein vaccine induced robust neutralization antibody responses comparable to those generated by live RSV infection. Importantly, adjuvanted G protein significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nose at early time points following viral challenge. Antibody kinetics determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance showed that adjuvanted G generated 10-fold higher G-binding antibodies compared to non-adjvuanted G vaccine and live RSV infection, which correlated strongly with both neutralization titers and viral load titers in the nose and lungs post-viral challenge. Antibody diversity analysis revealed immunodominant antigenic sites in the N- and C-termini of the RSV-G protein, that were boosted {\textgreater}10-fold by adjuvant and inversely correlated with viral load titers. Enhanced lung pathology was observed only in animals vaccinated with FI-RSV, but not in animals vaccinated with unadjuvanted or adjuvanted RSV-G vaccine after viral challenge. The bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein could be developed as a protective vaccine against RSV disease.},

Nasal swabs were collected from 114 cattle on initial BRD treatment. Processing included modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Seven BRD necropsy cases were included for 121 total cases. Mean number of days on feed before first sample was 14.9 days. Swabs and tissue homogenates were tested by gel based PCR (G-PCR), quantitative-PCR (qPCR) and quantitative real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and viral culture. There were 87/114 (76.3{\%}) swabs positive for at least one virus by at least one test. All necropsy cases were positive for at least one virus. Of 121 cases, positives included 18/121 (14.9{\%}) BoHV-1; 19/121 (15.7{\%}) BVDV; 76/121 (62.8{\%}) BoCV; 11/121 (9.1{\%}) BRSV; and 10/121 (8.3{\%}) PI3V. For nasal swabs, G-PCR (5 viruses) detected 44/114 (38.6{\%}); q-PCR and qRT-PCR (4 viruses) detected 81/114 (71.6{\%}); and virus isolation detected 40/114 (35.1{\%}). Most were positive for only one or two tests, but not all three tests. Necropsy cases had positives: 5/7 G-PCR, 5/7 q-PCR and qRT-PCR, and all were positive by cell culture. In some cases, G-PCR and both real time PCR were negative for BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V in samples positive by culture. PCR did not differentiate field from vaccines strains of BoHV-1, BVDV, and PI3V. However based on sequencing and analysis, field and vaccine strains of culture positive BoHV-1, BoCV, BVDV, and PI3V, 11/18 (61.1{\%}) of BoHV-1 isolates, 6/17 (35.3{\%}) BVDV isolates, and 1/10 (10.0{\%}) PI3V identified as vaccine. BRSV was only identified by PCR testing. Interpretation of laboratory tests is appropriate as molecular based tests and virus isolation cannot separate field from vaccine strains. Additional testing using sequencing appears appropriate for identifying vaccine strains.},

abstract = {Current strategies for influenza virus vaccines primarily aim to elicit immune responses towards the globular head domain of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein so that binding of the virus to membrane receptors on the host cells is inhibited. In the present study, we show a novel strategy to generate immunity against the highly conserved region of the influenza virus. The globular head domain was replaced by different linkers to generate a headless HA (stalk domain) and then coexpressed with influenza M1 proteinin Tni insect cells. The expression was validated by western blot analysis, and stalk domain with peptides (GGGGS)4 linkers was identified to anchor in a stable way to the cell membrane. An immunoelectron microscope showed that stalk domain with (GGGGS)4 linkers were steadily incorporated to the surface of influenza virus-like particles (VLPs). Mice immunized with these VLPs exhibited enhanced systemic antibody responses with increased binding avidity and study found high titers of ADCC antibodies to the influenza virus, these VLPs also induced mucosal immune responses and produced antigen-specific IgG and IgA in nasal and lung washes. In addition, antigen-specific IgG antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) increased significantly in the spleen and lymph node. The results of this study suggest that the headless HA is a useful target in developing a universal vaccine against influenza virus.},

abstract = { The mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) causes severe central nervous system diseases and cycles between Culex mosquitoes and different vertebrates. For JEV and some other flaviviruses, oronasal transmission is described, but the mode of infection is unknown. Using nasal mucosal tissue explants and primary porcine nasal epithelial cells (NEC) at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could represent the route of entry and exit for JEV in pigs. Porcine NEC at the ALI exposed to with JEV resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines, indicating infection and replication in macrophages. Moreover, macrophages stimulated by alarmins, including interleukin-25, interleukin-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin, were more permissive to the JEV infection. Altogether, our data are important to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus in pigs.  IMPORTANCE JEV, a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology composed of a mosquito-waterbird cycle and a cycle involving pigs, which amplifies virus transmission to mosquitoes, leading to increased human cases. JEV can be transmitted between pigs by contact in the absence of arthropod vectors. Moreover, virus or viral RNA is found in oronasal secretions and the nasal epithelium. Using nasal mucosa tissue explants and three-dimensional porcine nasal epithelial cells cultures and macrophages as ex vivo and in vitro models, we determined that the nasal epithelium could be a route of entry as well as exit for the virus. Infection of nasal epithelial cells resulted in apical and basolateral virus shedding and release of monocyte recruiting chemokines and therefore infection and replication in macrophages, which is favored by epithelial-cell-derived cytokines. The results are relevant to understand the mechanism of non-vector-borne direct transmission of JEV. },

abstract = {Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a reemerging, ordinarily mosquito-transmitted, alphavirus that occasionally produces hemorrhagic manifestations, such as nose bleed and bleeding gums, in human patients. Interferon response factor 3 and 7 deficient (IRF3/7-/-) mice, which are deficient for interferon $\alpha$/$\beta$ responses, reliably develop hemorrhagic manifestations after CHIKV infection. Here we show that infectious virus was present in the oral cavity of CHIKV infected IRF3/7-/- mice, likely due to hemorrhagic lesions in the olfactory epithelium that allow egress of infected blood into the nasal, and subsequently, oral cavities. In addition. IRF3/7-/- mice were more susceptible to infection with CHIKV via intranasal and oral routes, with IRF3/7-/- mice also able to transmit virus mouse-to-mouse without an arthropod vector. Cynomolgus macaques often show bleeding gums after CHIKV infection, and analysis of saliva from several infected monkeys also revealed the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus. Furthermore, saliva samples collected from several acute CHIKV patients with hemorrhagic manifestations were found to contain viral RNA and infectious virus. Oral fluids can therefore be infectious during acute CHIKV infections, likely due to hemorrhagic manifestations in the oral/nasal cavities. Copyright:},

abstract = {Introduction: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of severe respiratory illness in infants. There is no effective vaccine and the only effective treatment available is the monoclonal antibody palivizumab which reduces the risk of severe RSV disease in prematurely born infants. However, palivizumab is too costly to allow for wide implementation and thus treatment is restricted to supportive care. Despite extensive efforts to develop a vaccine, progress has been hindered by the difficulty in measuring and assessing immunological correlates of RSV vaccine efficacy in the presence of high levels of pre-existing RSV antibodies. Methods: Here we describe a new method for measuring the functional activity of antibodies induced by vaccination distinct from pre-existing antibodies. Antibodies in lymphocyte supernatants (ALS) from the cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of young adults who had recently been vaccinated with a novel RSV candidate vaccine were directly assayed for virus neutralising activity. An ELISA method was used to measure antibodies in nasal and serum samples and then compared with the adapted ALS based method. Results: There was a wide background distribution of RSV-specific antibodies in serum and nasal samples that obscured vaccine-specific responses measured two weeks after vaccination. No RSV-specific antibodies were observed at baseline in ALS samples, but a clear vaccine-specific antibody response was observed in ALS seven days after the administration of each dose of vaccine. These vaccine-specific antibodies in ALS displayed functional activity in vitro, and quantification of this functional activity was unperturbed by pre-existing antibodies from natural exposure. The results demonstrate a promising new approach for assessing functional immune responses attributed to RSV vaccines.},

abstract = {This study reports the results of a systematic screening for respiratory viruses in pediatric outpatients from an emergency department (ED) in southern Brazil during two consecutive influenza seasons. Children eligible for enrollment in this study were aged 24-59 months and presented with acute respiratory symptoms and fever. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to identify the respiratory viruses involved. In total, 492 children were included in this study: 248 in 2010 and 244 in 2011. In 2010, 136 samples (55{\%}) were found to be positive for at least one virus and the most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (18{\%}), adenovirus (AdV) (13{\%}), and human coronavirus (CoV) (5{\%}). In 2011, 158 samples (65{\%}) were found to be positive for at least one virus, and the most frequently detected were HRV (29{\%}), AdV (12{\%}), and enterovirus (9{\%}). Further, the presence of asthma (OR, 3.17; 95{\%} CI, 1.86-5.46) was independently associated with HRV infection, whereas fever was associated with AdV (OR, 3.86; 95{\%} CI, 1.31-16.52) and influenza infections (OR, 3.74; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-16.06). Ten patients (2{\%}) were diagnosed with pneumonia, and six of these tested positive for viral infection (4 HRV, 1 RSV, and 1 AdV). Thus, this study identified the most common respiratory viruses found in preschool children in the study region and demonstrated their high frequency, highlighting the need for improved data collection, and case management in order to stimulate preventive measures against these infections.},

abstract = {Background The 2014/15 influenza season in Canada was characterized by an early epidemic due to vaccine-mismatched influenza A(H3N2) viruses, disproportionately affecting elderly individuals 65-years-old. We assessed vaccine effectiveness (VE) against A(H3N2) hospitalization among elderly individuals during the peak weeks of the 2014/15 epidemic in Quebec, Canada. Methods Nasal specimens and clinical/epidemiological data were collected within 7 days of illness onset from elderly patients admitted with respiratory symptoms to one of four participating hospitals between November 30, 2014 and January 13, 2015. Cases tested RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) and controls tested negative for any influenza. VE was assessed by test-negative case-control design. Results There were 314 participants including 186 cases (62{\%} vaccinated) and 128 controls (59{\%} vaccinated) included in primary VE analysis. Median age was 81.5 years, two-thirds were admitted from the community and 91{\%} had underlying comorbidity. Crude VE against A (H3N2) hospitalization was -17{\%} (95{\%}CI: -86{\%} to 26{\%}), decreasing to -23{\%} (95{\%}CI: -99 to 23{\%}) with adjustment for age and comorbidity, and to -39{\%} (95{\%}CI: -142 to 20{\%}) with additional adjustment for specimen collection interval, calendar time, type of residence and hospital. In sensitivity analyses, VE estimates were improved toward the null with restriction to participants admitted from the community (-2{\%}; 95{\%}CI: -105 to 49{\%}) or with specimen collection ≤4 days since illness onset (- 8{\%}; 95{\%}CI: -104 to 43{\%}) but further from the null with restriction to participants with comorbidity (-51{\%}; 95{\%}CI: -169 to 15{\%}). Conclusion The 2014/15 mismatched influenza vaccine provided elderly patients with no cross-protection against hospitalization with the A(H3N2) epidemic strain, reinforcing the need for adjunct protective measures among high-risk individuals and improved vaccine options.},

abstract = {The oncogenicity of gamma-herpesviruses ($\gamma$HVs) motivates efforts to control them and their persistence makes early events key targets for intervention. Human $\gamma$HVs are often assumed to enter naive hosts orally and infect B cells directly. However, neither assumption is supported by direct evidence, and vaccination with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) gp350, to block virion binding to B cells, failed to reduce infection rates. Thus, there is a need to re-evaluate assumptions about $\gamma$HV host entry. Given the difficulty of analysing early human infections, potentially much can be learned from animal models. Genomic comparisons argue that $\gamma$HVs colonized mammals long before humans speciation, and so that human $\gamma$HVs are unlikely to differ dramatically in behaviour from those of other mammals. Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), which like EBV and the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) persists in memory B cells, enters new hosts via olfactory neurons and exploits myeloid cells to spread. Integrating these data with existing knowledge of human and veterinary $\gamma$HVs suggests a new model of host entry, with potentially important implications for infection control.},

S. suis has been shown to develop in vitro resistance to the two leading drugs of choice, penicillin and gentamicin. Because of this, we have pursued an alternative therapy to treat these pathogens using bacteriophage lysins. The bacteriophage lysin PlySs2 is derived from an S. suis phage and displays potent lytic activity against most strains of that species including serotypes 2 and 9. At 64 $\mu$g/ml, PlySs2 reduced multiple serotypes of S. suis by 5 to 6-logs within 1 hour in vitro and exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 32 $\mu$g/ml for a S. suis serotype 2 strain and 64 $\mu$g/ml for a serotype 9 strain. Using a single 0.1-mg dose, the colonizing S. suis serotype 9 strain was reduced from the murine intranasal mucosa by {\textgreater}4 logs; a 0.1-mg dose of gentamicin reduced S. suis by {\textless}3-logs. A combination of 0.05 mg PlySs2 + 0.05 mg gentamicin reduced S. suis by {\textgreater}5-logs. While resistance to gentamicin was induced after systematically increasing levels of gentamicin in an S. suis culture, the same protocol resulted in no observable resistance to PlySs2. Thus, PlySs2 has both broad and high killing activity against multiple serotypes and strains of S. suis, making it a possible tool in the control and prevention of S. suis infections in pigs and humans.},

NECs were obtained from eight patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and 11 non-atopic healthy controls (HC) by nasal scraping, grown to confluence and exposed to PIV3, RV1B infection or TLR-3 and TLR-7/8 agonists. Interferon (IFN)-$\lambda$1, IFN-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$ and regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) release into the cell culture supernatants was assessed at 8, 24 and 48 h upon infection or 8 and 24 h after stimulation with poly(I:C) and R848. mRNA levels of IFNs, RANTES, interferon regulatory transcription factor (IRF)3, IRF7 and viral gene copy number were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PIV3 but not RV1B replication 48 h after infection was significantly lower (P {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}01) in NECs from AR patients compared to HC. PIV3 infection induced significantly less IFN-$\lambda$1 (both protein and mRNA) in NECs from AR compared to HC. IFN-$\beta$ mRNA expression and RANTES protein release and mRNA expression tended to be smaller in AR compared HC cells in response to both viruses. Stimulation with TLR-3 agonist [poly (I:C)] induced similar IFN-$\lambda$1 and RANTES generation in AR and HC subjects. Viral infections in NECs induced IRF7 expression, which correlated with IFN and RANTES expression. These data suggest that virus proliferation rates and the immune response profile are different in nasal epithelial cells from patients with allergic rhinitis compared to healthy individuals.},

No standardised technique has been reported specifically for viral sampling in the sinonasal passages. Aim: To optimise viral sampling techniques from the sinonasal cavity. Methods: Sterile cytology brushes were used under endoscopic guidance to sample the sinonasal mucosa at time of endoscopic sinus surgery at both the middle and inferior meatuses (MM and IM). DNA and RNA were extracted from the samples and underwent PCR or RT-PCR testing, respectively, for a panel of 15 common upper respiratory tract viruses. Results: Twenty-four adult patients were recruited for this study. 18/24 (75{\%}) patients were positive for virus in at least one site, while 8/24 (33{\%}) were positive for virus at both sites. The mean number of viruses identified at the two sites were similar (0.875 ± 0.899 at the MM vs. 0.750 ± 1.032 at the IM). 6/24 (25{\%}) of patients showed no virus at either site, while 3/24 (12.5{\%}) demonstrated the same viral species at both sites. Conclusion: Although the number of viruses present at different sites with the nasal cavity are similar, discord exists in the viral species between sites. It is therefore recommended that both sites are sampled in the clinical and research setting better to characterise the viral species within the nasal cavity.},

abstract = {Background: BCoV is identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, complicating its assessment as a primary pathogen. Objectives: To investigate the detection rates of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves and to describe the usefulness of a pancoronavirus reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR (PanCoV-RT-PCR) assay to identify BCoV in samples of diarrheic calves. Animals: Two hundred and eighty-six calves {\textless}21 days. Calves with liquid or semiliquid feces, temperature {\textgreater}39.5°C, and inappetence were considered as cases, and those that had pasty or firm feces and normal physical examination were designated as controls. Methods: Prospective case–control study. A specific BCoV-RT-PCR assay was used to detect BCoV in fecal samples. Association between BCoV and health status was evaluated by exact and random effect logistic regression. Fecal (n = 28) and nasal (n = 8) samples from diarrheic calves were tested for the presence of BCoV by both the PanCoV-RT-PCR and a specific BCoV-RT-PCR assays. A Kappa coefficient test was used to assess the level of agreement of both assays. Results: BCoV was detected in 55{\%} (157/286) of calves; 46{\%} (66/143), and 64{\%} (91/143) of healthy and diarrheic calves, respectively. Diarrheic calves had higher odds of BCoV presence than healthy calves (OR: 2.16, 95{\%} CI: 1.26 to 3.83, P = 0.004). A good agreement between PanCoV-RT-PCR and BCoV-RT-PCR to detect BCoV was identified ($\kappa$ = 0.68, 95{\%} CI: 0.392 to 0.967; P {\textless} 0.001). Conclusions and Clinical Importance: BCoV was more likely to be detected in diarrheic than healthy calves. The PanCoV-RT-PCR assay can be a useful tool to detect CoV samples from diarrheic calves.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the number of viral genome sequences deposited in available databases has grown exponentially. However, sequencing methodology vary widely and many published works have relied on viral enrichment by viral culture or nucleic acid amplification with specific primers rather than through unbiased techniques such as metagenomics. The genome of RNA viruses is highly variable and these enrichment methodologies may be difficult to achieve or may bias the results. In order to obtain genomic sequences of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) from positive nasopharyngeal aspirates diverse methodologies were evaluated and compared. A total of 29 nearly complete and complete viral genomes were obtained. The best performance was achieved with a DNase I treatment to the RNA directly extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and library preparation performed with Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit with manual normalization. An average of 633,789 and 1,674,845 filtered reads per library were obtained with MiSeq and NextSeq 500 platforms, respectively. The higher output of NextSeq 500 was accompanied by the increasing of duplicated reads percentage generated during SISPA (from an average of 1.5{\%} duplicated viral reads in MiSeq to an average of 74{\%} in NextSeq 500). HRSV genome recovery was not affected by the presence or absence of duplicated reads but the computational demand during the analysis was increased. Considering that only samples with viral load E+06 copies/ml NPA were tested, no correlation between sample viral loads and number of total filtered reads was observed, nor with the mapped viral reads. The HRSV genomes showed a mean coverage of 98.46{\%} with the best methodology. In addition, genomes of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1–3 (HPIV1-3) were also obtained with the selected optimal methodology.},

Objectives: Measure the acceptability, adequacy, timeliness, and validity of self-collected nasal swabs among adults {\textgreater}65 years in Thailand. Methods: Our evaluation consisted of two parts: a one-month study among randomly selected, community-dwelling older adults to simulate community-based surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARI); and a clinic study of older adults with ARI to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of self-collected nasal swabs for influenza virus infection compared with healthcare worker (HCW)-collected nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs. Results: In the community study, 24{\%} of participants experienced an ARI during the observation period. All (100{\%}) participants with an ARI self-collected nasal swabs within 72 hours of symptom onset of which 92{\%} were considered adequate samples. In the clinic study, 45{\%} of patients with ARI presented within 72 hours of symptom onset. The sensitivity of self-collected nasal swabs for detection of influenza virus infection was 78{\%} (95{\%} CI 40-97) compared to nasopharyngeal and 88{\%} (95{\%} CI 47-100) compared to nasal swabs collected by HCWs. Specificity was 100{\%} (95{\%} CI 97-100) compared to both methods. Self-collection of nasal swabs was found acceptable by 99{\%} of participants in both studies. Conclusions: Self-collection of nasal swabs was acceptable to older adults in Thailand who were able to take adequate samples. Self-collection of nasal swabs may improve the timeliness of sample collection but lower sensitivity will need to be considered.},

Thus, we characterized asymptomatic and symptomatic HRV infections by incidence, species diversity, and viral load of 502 university students during September and October of 2010 and 2011 from nasal swabs and electronically submitted symptom questionnaires. We tested all symptomatic students and randomly sampled participants who remained asymptomatic (n=25/week, over 8weeks each study year) on a weekly basis by real-time PCR and sequenced HRV positives. HRV was identified in 33/400 (8.3{\%}) and 85/92 (92.4{\%}) of the asymptomatic and symptomatic students, respectively. We identified a higher than previously reported rate of HRV-B in both groups, although the distribution of HRV species was similar (P=0.37). Asymptomatic viral load averaged 1.2 log{\textless}inf{\textgreater}10{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} copies/mL lower than symptomatic HRV (P{\textless}0.001).

Macaques represent an interesting animal model to evaluate potential treatments because of their genetic, anatomical and immunological proximity with humans. However, the parameters that influence hRSV growth and control in this model are still poorly understood. We have documented in the following study the influence of age as well as repeated infections on the virological, clinical and immunological parameters of this animal model. Following intranasal inoculation, hRSV replicated in the upper respiratory tract for less than 15 days with no clinical signs regardless of age. Interestingly, we observed the induction of a local immune response at the nasal mucosa as assessed by expression profiles of inflammatory and IFN-stimulated genes. Animals also developed specific antibodies and were immune to reinfection. Thus, we showed that even in infant macaques, intranasal hRSV infection induced both local and systemic immune responses to efficiently control the virus.},

abstract = {Cilia of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are the primary site of odor binding; hence, their loss results in anosmia, a clinical manifestation of pleiotropic ciliopathies for which there are no curative therapies. We used OSN-specific Ift88 knock-out mice (Ift88(osnKO)) of both sexes to examine the mechanisms of ciliopathy-induced olfactory dysfunction and the potential for gene replacement to rescue odorant detection, restore olfactory circuitry, and restore odor-guided behaviors. Loss of OSN cilia in Ift88(osnKO) mice resulted in substantially reduced odor detection and odor-driven synaptic activity in the olfactory bulb (OB). Defects in OSN axon targeting to the OB were also observed in parallel with aberrant odor-guided behavior. Intranasal gene delivery of wild-type IFT88 to Ift88(osnKO) mice rescued OSN ciliation and peripheral olfactory function. Importantly, this recovery of sensory input in a limited number of mature OSNs was sufficient to restore axonal targeting in the OB of juvenile mice, and with delayed onset in adult mice. In addition, restoration of sensory input re-established course odor-guided behaviors. These findings highlight the spare capacity of the olfactory epithelium and the plasticity of primary synaptic input into the central olfactory system. The restoration of peripheral and central neuronal function supports the potential for treatment of ciliopathy-related anosmia using gene therapy.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Ciliopathies, for which there are no curative therapies, are genetic disorders that alter cilia morphology and/or function in numerous tissue types, including the olfactory system, leading to sensory dysfunction. We show that in vivo intranasal gene delivery restores peripheral olfactory function in a ciliopathy mouse model, including axonal targeting in the juvenile and adult olfactory bulb. Gene therapy also demonstrated restoration of olfactory perception by rescuing odor-guided behaviors. Understanding the therapeutic window and viability for gene therapy to restore odor detection and perception may facilitate translation of therapies to ciliopathy patients with olfactory dysfunctions.},

abstract = {Infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) generally presents as a mild, upper airway disease in human patients but may cause severe lower airway disease in the very young and very old. Progress toward understanding the mechanisms of RSV pathogenesis has been hampered by a lack of relevant rodent models. Mice, the species most commonly used in RSV research, are resistant to upper respiratory infection and do not recapitulate the pattern of virus spread in the human host. To address the need for better rodent models of RSV infection, we have characterized the acute and chronic pathology of RSV infection of a relatively permissive host, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus). We demonstrate that virus delivered to the upper airway results in widespread RSV replication in the ciliated respiratory epithelial cells of the nasal cavity and, to a lesser extent, of the lung. Although acute inflammation is relatively mild and rapidly eliminated after viral clearance, chronic, eosinophilic lung pathology persists. These data support the use of cotton rats as a robust rodent model of human RSV disease, including the association between RSV pneumonia and subsequent development of allergic asthma.},

abstract = {Measles is an acute systemic viral infection with immune system interactions that play essential roles in multiple stages of infection and disease. Measles virus (MeV) infection does not induce type 1 interferons, but leads to production of cytokines and chemokines associated with nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF$\kappa$B) signaling and activation of the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein (NLRP3) inflammasome. This restricted response allows extensive virus replication and spread during a clinically silent latent period of 10-14 days. The first appearance of the disease is a 2-3 day prodrome of fever, runny nose, cough, and conjunctivitis that is followed by a characteristic maculopapular rash that spreads from the face and trunk to the extremities. The rash is a manifestation of the MeV-specific type 1 CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell adaptive immune response with lymphocyte infiltration into tissue sites of MeV replication and coincides with clearance of infectious virus. However, clearance of viral RNA from blood and tissues occurs over weeks to months after resolution of the rash and is associated with a period of immunosuppression. However, during viral RNA clearance, MeV-specific antibody also matures in type and avidity and T cell functions evolve from type 1 to type 2 and 17 responses that promote B cell development. Recovery is associated with sustained levels of neutralizing antibody and life-long protective immunity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD20 positive NK/T-cell lymphoma is extremely rare and difficult for clinical treatment. Due to the lack of an established cell model for this disease, less is known about its biological characterization and potential therapeutic options. METHODS: A cell line of NK/T-cell lymphoma, which was enriched by magnetic sorting with proper cell surface markers (CD56) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) drawn from a 21-year-old male patient with nasal angiocentric NK/T-cell lymphoma, was designated as ZQNK-29. Immunophenotypic analysis of ZQNK-29 was performed by flow cytometric and immunohistochemical analysis. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis was used for cytogenetic analysis of ZQNK-29. Potential rearrangements of the immunoglobulin gene and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were examined by PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS: ZQNK-29 cells express the phenotypic T-cell marker (CD3), T cell activation markers (HLA-DR), markers for both NK and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (TIA-1), and B-lineage marker CD20; however, expression of CD56 was not detected in expanded ZQNK-29 cells although this NK cell surface marker was used as one of selective cell surface markers for the initial isolation of NK/T cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that the pattern of gene expressions for infected EBV was latency type III, with the expressions of LMP1, EBNA-1, and EBNA-2; no rearrangements were found in the heavy-chain of the immunoglobulin gene or in the y chain of the T cell receptors (TCRs) gene. CGH analysis demonstrated that ZQNK-29 possessed an abnormal karyotype, 46XY, 1p (dist)+, 4p (dist)+, 4q (mid)-, 5q (mid)-, 9q (dist)+, 16p (dist)+, 16q (dist)+, 17p+, 17q (dist)+, 19q (dist)+, 20p+, 20q+, 21q+, and 22q+. Of these, 1p (dist)+, which has been confirmed to be mitochondrial DNA amplification, is believed to be mainly caused by EBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: ZQNK-29 is a well characterized premature human NK/T-cell lymphoma cell line with expression of the B-cell marker CD20 and will provide a useful pre-clinic model for characterization and potential therapeutic studies of the aggressive NK/T-cell lymphoma.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) in a light-induced retinal degeneration model and to explore the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Intravitreal injection of recombinant GILZ-overexpressing lentivirus (OE-GILZ-rLV) and short hairpin RNA targeting GILZ recombinant lentivirus (shRNA-GILZ-rLV) was performed to up- and downregulate retinal GILZ, respectively. Three days after stable transduction, rats were exposed to continuous bright light (5000 lux) for 2 days. Retinal function was assessed by full-field electroretinography (ERG), and the retinal structure was examined for photoreceptor survival and death in rats kept under a 12-hour light:2-hour dark cycle following light exposure. The expression levels of retinal Bcl-xL, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were examined by Western blotting or real-time PCR at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after light exposure. RESULTS: Exposure to bright light downregulated retinal GILZ in parallel with the downregulation of Bcl-xL and the upregulation of active caspase-3. Overexpression of retinal GILZ attenuated the decrease of Bcl-xL and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after bright light exposure, respectively. GILZ silencing aggravated the downregulation of Bcl-xL induced by bright light exposure. Bright light exposure reduced the amplitude of ERG, increased the number of apoptotic photoreceptor cells, and decreased retinal thickness; and GILZ overexpression could attenuate all these effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of GILZ by OE-GILZ-rLV transduction protected the retina from light-induced cellular damage by activating antiapoptotic pathways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV) infection results in high morbidity and mortality and is primarily transmitted in communities by contact with infectious bodily fluids. While clinical and experimental evidence indicates that EBOV is transmitted via mucosal exposure, the ability of non-biting muscid flies to mechanically transmit EBOV following exposure to the face had not been assessed. RESULTS: To investigate this transmission route, house flies (Musca domestica Linnaeus) were used to deliver an EBOV/blood mixture to the ocular/nasal/oral facial mucosa of four cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis Raffles). Following exposure, macaques were monitored for evidence of infection through the conclusion of the study, days 57 and 58. We found no evidence of systemic infection in any of the exposed macaques. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that there is a low potential for the mechanical transmission of EBOV via house flies - the conditions in this study were not sufficient to initiate infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Salivary gland malignancies are a very heterogeneous group of cancers, with histologically {\textgreater} 20 different subtypes, and prognosis varies greatly. Their etiology is unknown, however, a few small studies show presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in some subtypes, although the evidence for HPV having a causal role is weak. The aim of this study was to investigate if HPV plays a causal role in the development of different parotid salivary gland tumor subtypes. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 107 parotid salivary gland formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumors and 10 corresponding metastases, and tested for 27 different HPV types using a multiplex bead based assay. HPV DNA positive tumors were stained for p16(INK4a) overexpression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: One of the 107 malignant parotid salivary gland tumors (0.93{\%}) and its corresponding metastasis on the neck were positive for HPV16 DNA, and both also overexpressed p16(INK4a). The HPV positive primary tumor was a squamous cell carcinoma; neither mucoepidermoid nor adenoid cystic tumors were found HPV positive. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, HPV DNA analysis in a large number of malignant parotid salivary gland tumors, including 12 different subtypes, did not show any strong indications that tested HPV types have a causal role in the studied salivary gland tumor types.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In clinical studies involving a healthy volunteer human challenge model, a valid and reliable measure to assess the evolution of patient-reported symptom type and severity following viral exposure is necessary. This study examines the use of the InFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome (FLU-PRO) diary as a standardized measure of symptom severity in a healthy volunteer human challenge model. METHODS: Healthy adults admitted to the NIH Clinical Center (Day - 1) underwent a 9-day inpatient quarantine after intranasal challenge with a wild-type influenza A/H1N1pdm virus (Day 0). Participants completed the 32-item FLU-PRO diary twice daily for 14 days to assess presence, severity, and duration of symptoms across six body systems. Secondary analyses included descriptive statistics to examine FLU-PRO scores over the course of illness and analysis of variance to compare scores on Day 3 post-challenge by presence of viral shedding, and pre-challenge hemagglutinin and neuraminidase inhibition (HAI and NAI) titers. RESULTS: All but one subject (99{\%}), who was lost to follow-up, completed twice daily FLU-PRO diaries on all study assessment days. FLU-PRO demonstrated that 61 of 65 subjects reported symptoms (Days: Median 5, Mean 6 ± 7), of whom 37 (61{\%}) had viral shedding. Pre-challenge, 39 (64{\%}) and 10 (16{\%}) subjects had low ({\textless} 1:40) HAI and NAI titers, respectively. Nose, throat, body, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms reached peak intensity at Day 3, followed by chest/respiratory and eye symptoms at Day 4. Subjects with viral shedding had higher mean FLU-PRO scores compared to those without, except for Eye and GI domains (p {\textless}0.05). Mean FLU-PRO scores were significantly higher for subjects with low NAI titer (p {\textless}0.05) across all domains. No significant differences were observed between HAI titer groups. FLU-PRO scores of the low HAI-low NAI group (n = 10) were significantly higher (more severe) than the other two groups (p {\textless} 0.05) (high HAI-high NAI (n = 22), low HAI-high NAI (n = 29)). CONCLUSIONS: The FLU-PRO had high adherence and low respondent burden. It can be used to track symptom onset, intensity, duration, and recovery from influenza infection in clinical research. In this human challenge study, scores were responsive to change and distinguished known clinical subgroups. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01971255 First Registered October 2, 2013.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To identify the protective role of sodium cromoglycate in mice during influenza virus infection. DESIGN: H5N1 virus-infected mice were treated with the mast cell stabilizer sodium cromoglycate (SCG) to investigate its therapeutic effect. SAMPLE: The nose, trachea and lungs from mice were collected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Virus replication and host responses were determined by plaque assay, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and histology. RESULTS: SCG-treated mice survived better than did PBS-treated mice after H5N1 virus infection. Mild pathological changes with fewer inflammatory cell infiltration and fewer virus antigens were observed in the nose, trachea, and lungs of SCG-treated mice on days 3 and 5 post-infection. However, no significant changes in viral load in the lungs were detected between SCG- and PBS-treated mice. Furthermore, significantly decreased expression of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, Toll-like receptor 3, and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-b was detected in the lungs of SCG-treated mice, and no higher expression of interferon-c was detected. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SCG has therapeutic roles in H5N1 virus-infected mice by alleviating the inflammatory response rather than inhibition of viral replication in the lungs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus infection is a major cause of asthma exacerbations. OBJECTIVES: We studied nasal and bronchial mucosal inflammatory responses during experimental rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. METHODS: We used nasosorption on days 0, 2-5 and 7 and bronchosorption at baseline and day 4 to sample mucosal lining fluid to investigate airway mucosal responses to rhinovirus infection in patients with allergic asthma (n=28) and healthy non-atopic controls (n=11), by using a synthetic absorptive matrix and measuring levels of 34 cytokines and chemokines using a sensitive multiplex assay. RESULTS: Following rhinovirus infection asthmatics developed more upper and lower respiratory symptoms and lower peak expiratory flows compared to controls (all P{\textless}0.05). Asthmatics also developed higher nasal lining fluid levels of an anti-viral pathway (including IFN-$\gamma$, IFN-$\lambda$/IL-29, CXCL11/ITAC, CXCL10/IP10 and IL-15) and a type 2 inflammatory pathway (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, CCL17/TARC, CCL11/eotaxin, CCL26/eotaxin-3) (area under curve day 0-7, all P{\textless}0.05). Nasal IL-5 and IL-13 were higher in asthmatics at day 0 (P{\textless}0.01) and levels increased by days 3 and 4 (P{\textless}0.01). A hierarchical correlation matrix of 24 nasal lining fluid cytokine and chemokine levels over 7days demonstrated expression of distinct interferon-related and type 2 pathways in asthmatics. In asthmatics IFN-$\gamma$, CXCL10/IP10, CXCL11/ITAC, IL-15 and IL-5 increased in bronchial lining fluid following viral infection (all P{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Precision sampling of mucosal lining fluid identifies robust interferon and type 2 responses in the upper and lower airways of asthmatics during an asthma exacerbation. Nasosorption and bronchosorption have potential to define asthma endotypes in stable disease and at exacerbation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the research importance of rhinovirus detection in asymptomatic healthy infants, the literature remains sparse. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (and its species). METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 110 healthy, non-hospitalized infants without acute illness at an academic medical center from November 2013 through May 2014. We tested nasal swab specimens by using polymerase chain reaction and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: Overall, the median age was 3.8 months (IQR 2.0-5.1 months), 56 {\%} were male, and 90{\%} were born {\textgreater}37 weeks. RSV was detected in nasal swabs from infants (1.8{\%}). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5{\%}). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5{\%}), one rhinovirus-B (0.9{\%}), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3{\%}), and one untypeable (0.9{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of healthy, community-based infants, RSV was rare ({\textless}2{\%}) in nasal swabs, while rhinovirus was detected in 14.5{\%} with a predominance of rhinovirus-A and -C. These finding are important for understanding the clinical significance of rhinovirus detection among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis.},

abstract = {The potential of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-tk)-expressing olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) treated with ganciclovir (GCV) to induce cell death in adjacent HSV-tk-negative cells (bystander effect) has been well demonstrated. Although it has been shown that bystander effect occurs through the delivery of phosphorylated GCV, the bystander effect mechanism and the role of gap junctions for human OECs mediated suicide gene therapy in primary astrocytes of human glioblastma remain obscure. In the present study, the efficacy of a new method for the transfer of phosphorylated GCV from OECs into primary astrocytes was evaluated. Surgical biopsy of glioblastoma was used to isolate primary astrocyte. Biopsy of olfactory mucosa was applied to isolate olfactory ensheathing cell. Expression of S100-beta antigen was confirmed immunocytochemically in astrocytes and OECs. OECs were transduced to lentiviral containing thymidine kinase gene (TK) and co-cultured with astrocytes. Fluorescent dye transfer and western blot analysis indicated the expression of connexin43 between olfactory ensheathing cells and astrocytes whereas, expression of the gap junction protein connexin43 was inhibited by the gap junction inhibitor 18$\alpha$-glycyrrhethinic acid (AGA, 20 µg/ml). Furthermore, co-culture of astrocytes with OEC-TK in the presence of concentration of 30 µg/ml GCV led to a decrease in astrocytes survival rate. Also, apoptosis hallmarks, including DNA fragmentation in cell nuclear, expression increase of Bax to Bcl-2 ratio and increase of caspase3 activation were observed in this study. Our findings suggest that human olfactory ensheathing cells can deliver phosphorylated GCV into the glioblastoma derived astrocytes through gap junction communication for apoptosis induction.},

Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus and a novel Orthopneumovirus, provisionally named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared {\~{}}90 {\%} nucleotide identity to murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV found that approximately 30 {\%} of both feral and domestic swine sera were positive for antibodies cross-reactive with MPV.

abstract = {In early 2013, a Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris) in a zoo died of respiratory distress. All specimens from the tiger were positive for HPAI H5N1, which were detected by real-time PCR, including nose swab, throat swab, tracheal swab, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, aquae pericardii and cerebrospinal fluid. One stain of virus, A/Tiger/JS/1/2013, was isolated from the lung sample. Pathogenicity experiments showed that the isolate was able to replicate and cause death in mice. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HA and NA of A/Tiger/JS/1/2013 clustered with A/duck/Vietnam/OIE-2202/2012 (H5N1), which belongs to clade 2.3.2.1. Interestingly, the gene segment PB2 shared 98{\%} homology with A/wild duck/Korea/CSM-28/20/2010 (H4N6), which suggested that A/Tiger/JS/1/2013 is a novel reassortant H5N1 subtype virus. Immunohistochemical analysis also confirmed that the tiger was infected by this new reassortant HPAI H5N1 virus. Overall, our results showed that this Bengal tiger was infected by a novel reassortant H5N1, suggesting that the H5N1 virus can successfully cross species barriers from avian to mammal through reassortment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) is a betaretrovirus of sheep (ENTV-1) and goats (ENTV-2) associated with neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells of the ethmoid turbinate. Confirmation of the role of ENTV in the pathogenesis of enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA) has yet to be resolved due to the inability to culture the virus. Very little is known about the prevalence of this disease, particularly in China. METHODS: To evaluate the genetic diversity of ENTV-2 from Shaanxi province of China, the complete genome sequence of four isolates from Shaanxi province was determined by RT-PCR. These sequences were analyzed to evaluate their genetic relatedness with other small ruminant betaretroviruses. Phylogenetic analyses based on the gag gene and env gene were performed. RESULTS: The ENTV-2-Shaanxi1 genome shared 97.0{\%} sequence identity with ENTV-2-SC (accession number HM104174.1), and 89.6{\%} sequence identity with the ENTV-2 sequences (accession number AY197548.1). ENTV-2 is closely related to the ENTV-1 and jaagsiekte retrovirus (JSRV). The main sequence differences between these viruses reside in LTR, two small regions of Gag, Orf-x, and the transmembrane (TM) region of Env. A stretch of 6 consecutive proline residues exists in VR1 of the ENTV-2-Shaanxi1 {\~{}} 4 isolates. All the ENTV-2-Shaanxi isolates have the YXXM motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the Env. Phylogenetic analysis by nucleotide sequences showed that ENTV-2-Shaanxi1 {\~{}} 4 isolates were closest related to two ENTV-2 isolates published in NCBI, especially with ENTV-2-SC strain. CONCLUSIONS: This finding indicates that ENA most likely was introduced to Shaanxi province by the movement of contaminated goats from other areas in China. This study adds to understand the circulation, variation and distribution of ENTV-2, and may prove beneficial in future control or eradication programmes.},

Nasopharyngeal swabs were randomly collected from steers ( n = 23) and assessed for the presence of infectious agents of BRD by PCR and/or RT-PCR assays. These included: Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3). Pulmonary sections of one steer that died with clinical BRD were submitted for pathology and molecular testing. The frequencies of the pathogens identified from the nasopharyngeal swabs were: H. somni 39{\%} (9 of 23), BRSV 35{\%} (8 of 23), BCoV 22{\%} (5 of 23), and M. haemolytica 13{\%} (3 of 23). PCR or RT-PCR assays did not identify P. multocida, M. bovis, BoHV-1, BVDV, or BPIV-3 from the nasopharyngeal swabs. Single and concomitant associations of infectious agents of BRD were identified. Fibrinous bronchopneumonia was diagnosed in one steer that died; samples were positive for H. somni and M. haemolytica by PCR. H. somni, BRSV, and BCoV are important disease pathogens of BRD in feedlot cattle in Brazil, but H. somni and BCoV are probably under-reported.},

METHODS:  We analyzed the burden of RSV illness in a prospective cohort study of children aged ≤13 years during 2 consecutive respiratory seasons in Turku, Finland (2231 child-seasons of follow-up). We examined the children and obtained nasal swabs for the detection of RSV during each respiratory illness. The parents filled out daily symptom diaries throughout the study. RESULTS:  Of 6001 medically attended respiratory infections, 302 (5{\%}) were caused by RSV. Per 1000 children, the average annual RSV infection incidence rates among children aged {\textless}3, 3-6, and 7-13 years were 275, 117, and 46 cases, respectively. In children aged {\textless}3 years, acute otitis media developed in 58{\%}, and 66{\%} of children in this age group received antibiotics. The mean duration of RSV illness was longest (13.0 days) and the rate of parental work absenteeism was highest (136 days per 100 children with RSV illness) in children aged {\textless}3 years. CONCLUSIONS:  The burden of RSV is particularly great among outpatient children aged {\textless}3 years.

Evidence of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in one herd on the basis of detection of virus RNA in nasal swabs from three camels and significant increases in the antibody titers from three others. The three viruses were genetically identical, thus indicating introduction of a single virus into this herd. There was evidence of reinfection of camels that were previously seropositive, thus suggesting that prior infection does not provide complete immunity from reinfection, a finding that is relevant to camel vaccination strategies as a means to prevent zoonotic transmission.},

abstract = {Influenza virus infection in pigs is a major farming problem, causing considerable economic loss and posing a zoonotic threat. In addition the pig is an excellent model for understanding immunity to influenza viruses as this is a natural host pathogen system. Experimentally, influenza virus is delivered to pigs intra-nasally, by intra-tracheal instillation or by aerosol, but there is little data comparing the outcome of different methods. We evaluated the shedding pattern, cytokine responses in nasal swabs and immune responses following delivery of low or high dose swine influenza pdmH1N1 virus to the respiratory tract of pigs intra-nasally or by aerosol and compared them to those induced in naturally infected contact pigs. Our data shows that natural infection by contact induces remarkably high innate and adaptive immune response, although the animals were exposed to a very low virus dose. In contacts, the kinetics of virus shedding were slow and prolonged and more similar to the low dose directly infected animals. In contrast the cytokine profile in nasal swabs, antibody and cellular immune responses of contacts more closely resemble immune responses in high dose directly inoculated animals. Consideration of these differences is important for studies of disease pathogenesis and assessment of vaccine protective efficacy.},

abstract = {Using a large data set (n = 811), the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers was investigated to determine whether certain symptoms are correlated more closely than others with the inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and nasal neutrophils. Participants with community acquired acute respiratory infection underwent nasal lavage for IL-8 and neutrophil testing, in addition to multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Information about symptoms was obtained throughout the duration of the illness episode using the well-validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS-21). Global symptom severity was calculated by the area under the curve (AUC) plotting duration versus WURSS total. Of the specimens tested, 56{\%} were positively identified for one or more of nine different respiratory viruses. During acute respiratory infection illness, both IL-8 and neutrophils positively correlate with AUC (r(s) = 0.082, P = 0.022; r(s)  = 0.080, P = 0.030). IL-8 and neutrophils correlate with nasal symptom severity: runny nose (r = 0.13, P = {\textless} 0.00001; r = 0.18, P = {\textless} 0.003), plugged nose (r = 0.045, P = 0.003; r = 0.14, P = 0.058), and sneezing (r = -0.02, P = {\textless} 0.0001; r = -0.0055, P = 0.31). Neutrophils correlate with some quality of life measures such as sleeping well (r = 0.15, P = 0.026). Thus, the study demonstrates that IL-8 and neutrophils are correlated with severity of nasal symptoms during acute respiratory infection. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration of these or other biomarkers can predict the overall duration and severity of acute respiratory infection illness.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The Ebola outbreak of 2013-2016 severely affected West Africa and resulted in 2544 deaths and 1270 survivors in Guinea, the country where it began. This Ebola virus was the Zaire strain of the virus family Filoviridae. In this outbreak the case fatality rate was about 67{\%}. The survivors, declared cured after 2 negative blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results, face psychosocial disorders and rheumatic, ear-nose-throat, neurocognitive, and ophthalmologic complications. The goal of this study was to detect and describe ocular complications afflicting these survivors and to observe their occurrence and recurrences. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. METHODS: This prospective observational multicenter cohort study was initiated in March 2015. The cohort study included 341 survivors followed up in the infectious disease ward of Conakry, Forecariah, and Nz{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}kor{\'{e}} as of May 2016. The patients received multidisciplinary medical follow-up expected to last at least 1 year that included an eye examination as part of complete, free treatment. RESULTS: Systematic examination of 341 patients revealed 46 cases of uveitis (13.5{\%}), 6 cases of episcleritis (1.8{\%}), and 3 cases of interstitial keratitis (0.9{\%}). Uveitis was most frequently unilateral (78.3{\%}) and anterior (47.8{\%}) and occurred within the 2 months after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. Moreover, uveitis relapses were found up to 13 months after the negative PCR result for Ebola in the blood. CONCLUSION: Nearly 1 out of 6 survivors presented ocular disorders after discharge from the Ebola treatment center. An ophthalmologic follow-up for Ebola-infected patients should start, if possible, during the acute phase of the disease and last more than 1 year. Treatment guidelines need to be urgently developed and implemented.},

Baculovirus has proven to be a flexible platform for the generation of recombinant forms of hemagglutinin (HA) including subunit, VLP-displayed, and baculovirus-displayed antigens. These presentations have been shown to be efficacious in mouse, chicken, and ferret models but little is known about their immunogenicity in pigs. To assess the utility of these HA presentations in swine, Baculovirus constructs expressing HA fused to swine IgG2a Fc, displayed in a FeLV gag VLP, or displayed in the baculoviral envelope were generated. Vaccines formulated with these antigens wer The e administered to groups of pigs who were subsequently challenged with H1$\alpha$ cluster H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV) A/Swine/Indiana/1726/88. Our results demonstrate that vaccination with any of these three vaccines elicits robust hemagglutinin inhibition titers in the serum and decreased the severity of SIV-associated lung lesions after challenge when compared to placebo-vaccinated controls. In addition, the number of pigs with virus detected in the lungs and nasal passages was reduced. Taken together, the results demonstrate that these recombinant approaches expressed with the baculovirus expression vector system may be viable options for development of SIV vaccines for swine.},

abstract = {In addition to traditional risk factors such as smoking habits and alcohol consumption, certain microbes also play an important role in the generation of head and neck carcinomas. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types is strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and Epstein-Barr virus appears to be indispensable for the development of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Other viruses including torque teno virus and hepatitis C virus may act as co-carcinogens, increasing the risk of malignant transformation. A shift in the composition of the oral microbiome was associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, although the causal or casual role of oral bacteria remains to be clarified. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a mutagenic compound, by members of the oral microflora as well as by fungi including Candida albicans and others is a potential mechanism that may increase oral cancer risk. In addition, distinct Candida spp. also produce NBMA (N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine), a potent carcinogen. Inflammatory processes elicited by microbes may also facilitate tumorigenesis in the head and neck region.},

abstract = {Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are significant human pathogens. Although only a subset of HAdV serotypes commonly cause gastroenteritis in humans, most HAdV species replicate in the gastrointestinal tract. Knowledge of the complex interaction between HAdVs and the human intestinal epithelium has been limited by the lack of a suitable cell culture system containing relevant cell types. Recently, this need has been met by the stable and prolonged cultivation of primary intestinal epithelial cells as enteroids. Human enteroids have been used to reveal novel and interesting aspects of rotavirus, norovirus, and enterovirus replication, prompting us to explore their suitability for HAdV culture. We found that both prototype strains and clinical isolates of enteric and nonenteric HAdVs productively replicate in human enteroids. HAdV-5p, a respiratory pathogen, and HAdV-41p, an enteric pathogen, are both sensitive to type I and III interferons in human enteroid monolayers but not A549 cells. Interestingly, HAdV-5p, but not HAdV-41p, preferentially infected goblet cells. And, HAdV-5p but not HAdV-41p was potently neutralized by the enteric human alpha-defensin HD5. These studies highlight new facets of HAdV biology that are uniquely revealed by primary intestinal epithelial cell culture.IMPORTANCE Enteric adenoviruses are a significant cause of childhood gastroenteritis worldwide, yet our understanding of their unique biology is limited. Here we report robust replication of both prototype and clinical isolates of enteric and respiratory human adenoviruses in enteroids, a primary intestinal cell culture system. Recent studies have shown that other fastidious enteric viruses replicate in human enteroids. Therefore, human enteroids may provide a unified platform for culturing enteric viruses, potentially enabling isolation of a greater diversity of viruses from patients. Moreover, both the ability of interferon to restrict respiratory and enteric adenoviruses and a surprising preference of a respiratory serotype for goblet cells demonstrate the power of this culture system to uncover aspects of adenovirus biology that were previously unattainable with standard cell lines.},

During peak community RSV transmission, three swabs were collected from the nose, hand and personal clothing of visitors and health care workers (HCW) in NICU once every week for eight weeks. Nasal swabs were collected from every third neonate and from any neonate clinically suspected of having a respiratory infection. Environmental sampling of high touch areas was done once during the study period. All swabs were tested for RSV using real time RT-PCR. There were 173 (519 total) and 109 (327 total) swabs, each of nose, hand and dress from 84 HCWs and 80 visitors respectively and 81 nasal swabs from 55 neonates collected. Thirty five environmental swabs from surfaces of the beds, side tables, counter tops, chairs, tables and computers were collected. Overall 1{\%} of nasal swabs from each of HCWs, visitors and neonates, 4{\%} of dress specimens from visitors and 9{\%} of environmental swabs were positive for RSV-RNA. The results suggest that though the risk for RSV in the NICU remains low, personnel clothing are contaminated with RSV-RNA and may have a role in transmission.},

abstract = {The nasal mucosa is an important component of mucosal immunity. Immunogenic particles in inspired air are known to activate the local nasal mucosal immune system and can lead to sinonasal inflammation; however, little is known about the effect of this activation on the lung immune environment. Here, we showed that nasal inoculation of murine coronavirus (CoV) in the absence of direct lung infection primes the lung immune environment by recruiting activated monocytes (Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes) and NK cells into the lungs. Unlike infiltration of these cells into directly infected lungs, a process that requires type I IFN signaling, nasally induced infiltration of Ly6C+ inflammatory monocytes into the lungs is IFN-I independent. These activated macrophages ingested antigen and migrated to pulmonary lymph nodes, and enhanced both innate and adaptive immunity after heterologous virus infection. Clinically, such nasal-only inoculation of MHV-1 failed to cause pneumonia but significantly reduced mortality and morbidity of lethal pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) or influenza A virus. Together, the data indicate that the nose and upper airway remotely prime the lung immunity to protect the lungs from direct viral infections.},

The results demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 can adhere to the nasal epithelium and be taken up by DCs in the nasal mucosa, thereby inducing DC maturation and resulting in increased CD80, CD86, CD40 and MHCII expression and cytokine secretion. The frequencies of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and CD69(+) memory T cells were increased in spleens after nasal immunization with virus plus B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 compared to immunization with inactivated H9N2 AIV alone. Moreover, the levels of sIgA in the nasal cavity, the trachea, and the lung and the levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in serum were significantly increased in mice administered WIV plus SQR9 compared to mice administered H9N2 WIV alone. The results of this study demonstrated that B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9 can stimulate DC maturation to effectively induce an immune response. In conclusion, an effective immune response may result from the uptake of H9N2 by DCs in the nasal mucosa, thereby stimulating DC maturation and migration to cervical lymph nodes to initiate immune response.},

To address the characteristics of RSV-associated illness and risk factors of RSV infection among children under 5 years of age in Suzhou, China. From April 2011 to March 2014, we conducted a prospective surveillance among children in Suzhou, China. Nasal or throat swabs were collected from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and inpatients with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). RSV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and direct fluorescent antibody assay for children with ILI and SARI, respectively. Multivariable logistic-regression models were constructed to explore risk factors and symptoms of RSV infection. Of 3267 ILI and 1838 SARI children enrolled in the study, 192 (5.9{\%}) and 287 (15.6{\%}) tested positive for RSV, respectively. Among ILI patients, children with RSV infections visited clinics more often (P = 0.005) and had longer duration of fever (P = 0.032) than those without RSV infection. All RSV-positive children had an increased risk of having cough (OR = 2.9), rhinorrhea (OR = 1.6), breathing difficulty (OR = 3.4), wheezing (OR = 3.3), and irritability (OR = 2.7). Children aged {\textless}2 years, had history of prematurity (OR = 2.0) and recent respiratory infections (OR = 1.3) were more likely to get infected by RSV. Children with SARI had higher positive rate of RSV than those with ILI. Cough, rhinorrhea, and wheezing were the most common symptoms in RSV infection. Children aged {\textless}2 years, had history of prematurity and recent respiratory infections were the potential risk factors for RSV infection.},

Data were prospectively collected, and, in a subgroup of patients, COPD Assessment Test scores and human rhinovirus identification by polymerase chain reaction were available. Patients were also defined as having infrequent or frequent exacerbations ({\textless}2 or ≥2 exacerbations/yr, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At an aggregate of 4,368 visits, 209 patients with COPD were asked about their nasal symptoms. At 2,033 visits when the patients were stable, the odds ratio (OR) for nasal discharge increased by 1.32{\%} per year (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.19-1.45; P {\textless} 0.001); the OR for sneezing increased by 1.16{\%} (95{\%} CI, 1.05-1.29; P = 0.005); the OR for postnasal drip increased by 1.18{\%} (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.36; P = 0.016); and the OR for anosmia increased by 1.19{\%} (95{\%} CI, 1.03-1.37; P = 0.015). At visits when the patients were having exacerbations, nasal discharge was present for 7 days and blocked nose, sneezing, and postnasal drip increased for just 3 days. Anosmia did not change. Nasal discharge was more likely in patients with frequent exacerbations (OR, 1.96; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-3.28; P = 0.011), and COPD Assessment Test scores were higher by 1.06 units (95{\%} CI, 0.32-1.80; P = 0.005) when patients were stable and higher by 1.30 units (95{\%} CI, 0.05-2.57; P = 0.042) during exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS: Upper airway symptoms increase over time in patients with COPD and are related to the frequent exacerbation phenotype. These longitudinal changes may be due to increasing airway inflammation or to progression of COPD.},

abstract = {Intranasally administered live-attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccines provide significant protection against heterologous influenza A virus (IAV) challenge. However, LAIV administration can modify the bacterial microbiota in the upper respiratory tract, including alterations in species that cause pneumonia. We sought to evaluate the effect of Bordetella bronchiseptica colonization on LAIV immunogenicity and efficacy in swine, and the impact of LAIV and IAV challenge on B. bronchiseptica colonization and disease. LAIV immunogenicity was not significantly impacted by B. bronchiseptica colonization, but protective efficacy against heterologous IAV challenge in the upper respiratory tract was impaired. Titers of IAV in the nose and trachea of pigs that received LAIV were significantly reduced when compared to non-vaccinated, challenged controls, regardless of B. bronchiseptica infection. Pneumonia scores were higher in pigs colonized with B. bronchiseptica and challenged with IAV, but this was regardless of LAIV vaccination status. While LAIV vaccination provided significant protection against heterologous IAV challenge, the protection was not sterilizing and IAV replicated in the respiratory tract of all LAIV vaccinated pig. The interaction between IAV, B. bronchiseptica, and host led to development of acute-type B. bronchiseptica lesions in the lung. Thus, the data presented do not negate the efficacy of LAIV vaccination, but instead indicate that controlling B. bronchiseptica colonization in swine could limit the negative interaction between IAV and Bordetella on swine health.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus infection was examined using a human nasal epithelial cell model. Maximum levels of shed-virus were produced at between 3 and 5 days post-infection (dpi), and the infectivity of the shed-virus was stable up to 10 dpi. The highest levels of interferon signalling were recorded at 2dpi, and infection induced a widespread antivirus response in the nasal epithelium, involving both infected cells and non-infected cells. Although these cellular responses were associated with reduced levels of progeny virus production and restricted virus spread, they did not inhibit the infectivity virus that is shed early in infection. In the clinical context these data suggest that although the host cell response in the nasal epithelium may restrict the levels of progeny virus particles produced, the stability of the shed-virus in the nasal mucosa may be an important factor in both disease progression and virus transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infections are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult populations worldwide. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza is necessary for appropriate patient management during the influenza season and for optimal utilization of anti-influenza therapy. We prospectively tested the accuracy of a simple and rapid diagnostic method. METHODS: Ninety-eight samples (nasal and pharyngeal swabs) from patients with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms who presented to primary healthcare centres in Barcelona (Spain) were prospectively analyzed. The samples were collected as part of influenza surveillance program. Samples that had enough volume to make the new test after aliquoting the amount needed to perform routine tests were included. None of the samples were pre-selected as a result of their status in relation to influenza virus. Samples were analyzed by in-house real-time PCR and Alere i Influenza A {\&} B (Alere i), which uses isothermal amplification of nucleic acids for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B in nasal swabs transported in viral transport media. The two techniques were compared by positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). Statistical analysis was performed with Stata. RESULTS: Of the 98 samples analysed 90 were concordant; 46 (46.9{\%}) were positive and 44 (44.9{\%}) were negative. Five samples showed invalid results with the Alere i test and could be not re-tested due to insufficient sample volume and were not included in the final statistical analysis. In the 93 remaining samples, the Alere i test showed 97{\%} of accuracy having correctly classified 90 samples. We obtained discordant results in 3 samples (3{\%}). The PPA was 93.8{\%} for influenza A and 94.1{\%} for influenza B, and NPA was 100{\%} for influenza A and influenza B virus. In addition, the Alere i was very rapid (15 minutes or less) and extremely easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: The Alere i test provided a good correlation compared to the real-time PCR test for the diagnosis of influenza. Since this method can be performed in minutes, it allows immediate, accurate clinical decisions to prescribe appropriate antiviral treatment or isolation of patients.},

To further characterize differences in MPXV clade pathogenesis, groups of prairie dogs were intranasally infected (8 × 10(3) p.f.u.) with Congo Basin (CB) or West African (WA) MPXV, and 28 tissues were harvested on days 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 17, and 24 postinfection. Samples were evaluated for the presence of virus and gross and microscopic lesions. Virus was recovered from nasal mucosa, oropharyngeal lymph nodes, and spleen earlier in CB challenged animals (day 4) than WA challenged animals (day 6). For both groups, primary viremia (indicated by viral DNA) was seen on days 6-9 through day 17. CB MPXV spread more rapidly, accumulated to greater levels, and caused greater morbidity in animals compared to WA MPXV. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) findings, however, were similar. Two animals that succumbed to disease demonstrated abundant viral antigen in all organs tested, except for brain. Dual-IHC staining of select liver and spleen sections showed that apoptotic cells (identified by TUNEL) tended to colocalize with poxvirus antigen. Interestingly splenocytes were labelled positive for apoptosis more often than hepatocytes in both MPXV groups. These findings allow for further characterization of differences between MPXV clade pathogenesis, including identifying sites that are important during early viral replication and cellular response to viral infection.},

abstract = {Vaccination is recognized to be the most cost-effective means of preventing, controlling, and even eradicating infectious diseases. Conventional poultry are vaccinated through various routes including eye/nose drops, drinking water, vent brush, or injection. Efficient vaccination is an essential part of any good poultry management.The bursa of Fabricius is intimately connected to the cloaca and the intestinal system. It is well-known as a primary lymphoid organ in the chicken and a major channel through which environmental antigens stimulate the immune system. In this study we tested whether direct instillation of various viral vaccines and antigens into the cloaca (per bursam), could stimulate higher antibody titers and generate improved protection. Despite the very rapid absorption of the vaccines or antigens from the cloaca to the lumen of the Bursa of Fabricius, per bursam inoculation failed to generate a satisfactory immune response. In contrast conventional administration of live or inactivated commercial vaccines led to an acceptable level of seroconversion and protection against challenge.An interesting finding in this study was the fact that administration of a single priming dose of antigenic material at age 1 or 5 days, did not improve the response to a second administration at 14 days of age as expected. Instead, in most cases there was a reduced serum antibody response suggesting the induction of tolerance. This was true for all routes of administration (intramuscular, per ocular and per bursam) and for all formulations of vaccine.The current study reveals: 1) no advantage for direct application of live or inactivated vaccines or antigens into the bursa of Fabricius compared to common routes of vaccination, 2) that apparent desensitization or tolerance effects have important implications for poultry management, since in many countries, vaccination of day old chicks is compulsory or a well-accepted part of flock vaccination.According to our results, early vaccination can in fact reduce or inhibit a secondary immune response to subsequent vaccination and increase susceptibility to disease agents.},

abstract = {Circulating antibodies can access most tissues to mediate surveillance and elimination of invading pathogens. Immunoprivileged tissues such as the brain and the peripheral nervous system are shielded from plasma proteins by the blood-brain barrier and blood-nerve barrier, respectively. Yet, circulating antibodies must somehow gain access to these tissues to mediate their antimicrobial functions. Here we examine the mechanism by which antibodies gain access to neuronal tissues to control infection. Using a mouse model of genital herpes infection, we demonstrate that both antibodies and CD4 T cells are required to protect the host after immunization at a distal site. We show that memory CD4 T cells migrate to the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in response to infection with herpes simplex virus type 2. Once inside these neuronal tissues, CD4 T cells secrete interferon-$\gamma$ and mediate local increase in vascular permeability, enabling antibody access for viral control. A similar requirement for CD4 T cells for antibody access to the brain is observed after intranasal challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of CD4 T cells in mobilizing antibodies to the peripheral sites of infection where they help to limit viral spread.},

In fact, HPV may be the most significant causative agent implicated in sinonasal tumorigenesis and is implicated in as many as 21{\%} of sinonasal carcinomas. To date, there are no definitive, reliable and cost-effective, diagnostic tests approved by the FDA for the unequivocal determination of HPV status in head and neck cancers. We followed an exhaustive algorithm to correctly test HPV infection, including a sequential approach with p16INK4a IHC, viral DNA genotyping and in situ hybridization for E6/E7 mRNA. Here, we report a case of sinonasal carcinoma with discordant results using HPV test assays. The tumor we describe showed an irregular immunoreactivity for p16INK4a, and it tested positive for HPV DNA; nevertheless, it was negative for HR-HPV mRNA. We discuss the possible meaning of this discrepancy. It would be advisable to test HPV transcriptional status of sinonasal carcinoma on a diagnostic routine basis, not only by p16INK4a IHC assay, but also by HPV DNA genotyping and HR-HPV mRNA assessment.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses are a continuous threat to humans because of their ability to cross species barriers and adapt to new hosts. Data from murine studies, along with limited human data, suggest that CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that recognize conserved epitopes of structural influenza proteins are the main mediators of influenza virus clearance. Additionally, the fact that many CTLs recognize epitopes shared between different influenza strains offers the potential for broad cross-strain immunity. However, the mechanisms of cellular immunity against influenza viruses are poorly defined in humans, where the CTL response has been hard to measure and interpret. We developed a novel CTL assay that utilizes fully differentiated nasal human epithelial cells taken from volunteers as permissive targets for autologous peripheral blood-derived influenza virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This in vitro system of human lymphocyte-epithelial cell co-cultures can be considered as the closest approximation to events in vivo and can be employed for studying the interactions between the pathogen and human host. Modeling of the natural interaction process between the primary cell type that supports the productive replication of influenza and immune cells may allow us to put in perspective CTLs as a correlate of immunity to influenza in humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a common cause of pediatric hospitalization. microRNA, key regulators of the immune system, have not previously been investigated in respiratory specimens during viral infection. We investigated microRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of 42 RSV-positive infants, also comparing microRNA expression between disease severity subgroups. METHODS: Nasal mucosa cytology specimens were collected from RSV-positive infants and healthy controls. 32 microRNA were selected by microarray for qPCR verification in 19 control, 16 mild, 7 moderate and 19 severe disease samples. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, RSV-positive infants downregulated miR-34b, miR-34c, miR-125b, miR-29c, mir125a, miR-429 and miR-27b and upregulated miR-155, miR-31, miR-203a, miR-16 and let-7d. On disease subgroups analysis, miR-125a and miR-429 were downregulated in mild disease (p=0.03 and 0.02, respectively), but not in severe disease (p=0.3 and 0.3). CONCLUSION: microRNA expression in nasal epithelium cytology brushings of RSV-positive infants shows a distinct profile of immune-associated miRNA. miR-125a has important functions within NF-$\kappa$B signaling and macrophage function. The lack of downregulation of miR-125a and miR-429 in severe disease may help explain differences in disease manifestations on infection with RSV.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps is a multifactorial disease entity with an unclear pathogenesis. Contradictory data exist in the literature on the potential implication of viral elements in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of human herpes viruses (1-6) and Human Papilloma Virus in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and healthy controls. METHODS: Viral DNA presence was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction application to nasal polyps specimens from 91 chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps patients and nasal turbinate mucosa from 38 healthy controls. RESULTS: Epstein-Barr virus positivity was higher in nasal polyps (24/91; 26.4{\%}) versus controls (4/38; 10.5{\%}), but the difference did not reach significance (p=0.06). Human herpes virus-6 positivity was lower in nasal polyps (13/91; 14.29{\%}) versus controls (10/38; 26.32{\%}, p=0.13). In chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps group, 1 sample was herpes simplex virus-1-positive (1/91; 1.1{\%}), and another was cytomegalovirus-positive (1/91; 1.1{\%}), versus none in controls. No sample was positive for herpes simplex virus-2, varicella-zoster virus, high-risk-human papilloma viruses (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) and low-risk-human papilloma viruses (6, 11). CONCLUSION: Differences in Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus-6 positivity among patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and healthy controls are not statistically significant, weakening the likelihood of their implication in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps pathogenesis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infections are associated with a wide spectrum of disease. However, few studies have investigated in detail the epidemiological and virological characteristics of asymptomatic and mild illness with influenza virus infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2014, we followed up initially healthy individuals who were household contacts of symptomatic persons with laboratory-confirmed influenza, to identify secondary infections. Information from daily symptom diaries was used to classify infections as symptomatic (≥2 signs/symptoms, including fever ≥37.8°C, headache, myalgia, cough, sore throat, runny nose and sputum), paucisymptomatic (1 symptom only), or asymptomatic (none of these symptoms). We compared the patterns of influenza viral shedding between these groups. RESULTS: We identified 235 virologically confirmed secondary cases of influenza virus infection in the household setting, including 31 (13{\%}) paucisymptomatic and 25 (11{\%}) asymptomatic cases. The duration of viral RNA shedding was shorter and declined more rapidly in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic than in symptomatic cases. The mean levels of influenza viral RNA shedding in asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic cases were approximately 1-2 log10 copies lower than in symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of influenza viral shedding in patients with influenza who have very few or no symptoms reflects their potential for transmitting the virus to close contacts. These findings suggest that further research is needed to investigate the contribution of persons with asymptomatic or clinically mild influenza virus infections to influenza virus transmission in household, institutional, and community settings.},

Forty-one samples were positive for influenza B virus using quantitative RT-PCR, but no influenza A virus was detected. Antigenic characterization revealed that the influenza B viruses were of Yamagata and Victoria lineages, which was confirmed from genetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes. Co-circulation of influenza B viruses of both Yamagata and Victoria lineages in the slums of Dhaka indicates that introduction of a tetravalent vaccine formulation that includes both of these influenza B virus lineages would be more effective in this population.},

Complex factors related to the parasite and the host are attributed to the development of mucosal lesions. Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) can disrupt immune response, and may be the main determinant of severity of the disease; it should be investigated. OBJECTIVE: To study the existence of clinical differences between patients with ML with endosymbiosis by LRV1 and. those without it. METHODS: A cross-sectional cohort study with clinical evaluation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of Leishmania, species classification, and search of LRV1 was performed. Only patients with confirmed diagnosis of ML by positive PCR and with nasal mucosa injuries were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Out of 37 patients, 30 (81.1{\%}) were diagnosed with Leishmania braziliensis, five (13.5{\%}) with Leishmania guyanensis, and two (5.4{\%}) with mixed infection of L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis. LVR1 virus was present in 26 (70.3{\%}) of the cases. CONCLUSION: Correlation between clinical phenotype and presence of LRV1 was not observed, although the frequency of the virus is two-fold higher in mucosal lesions than that found in the literature on skin lesions in the same geographical area.},

abstract = {It is possible to model the progression of influenza virus from the upper respiratory tract to the lower respiratory tract in the mouse using viral inoculum delivered in a restricted manner to the nose. In this model, infection with the A/Udorn/307/72 (Udorn) strain of virus results ultimately in high viral titers in both the trachea and lungs. In contrast, the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain causes an infection that is almost entirely limited to the nasal passages. The factors that govern the progression of virus down the respiratory tract are not well understood. Here, we show that, while PR8 virus grows to high titers in the nose, an inhibitor present in the saliva blocks further progression of infection to the trachea and lungs and renders an otherwise lethal dose of virus completely asymptomatic. In vitro, the salivary inhibitor was capable of potent neutralization of PR8 virus and an additional 20 strains of type A virus and two type B strains that were tested. The exceptions were Udorn virus and the closely related H3N2 strains A/Port Chalmers/1/73 and A/Victoria/3/75. Characterization of the salivary inhibitor showed it to be independent of sialic acid and other carbohydrates for its function. This and other biochemical properties, together with its virus strain specificity and in vivo function, indicate that the mouse salivary inhibitor is a previously undescribed innate inhibitory molecule that may have evolved to provide pulmonary protection of the species from fatal influenza virus infection.IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus occasionally jumps from aquatic birds, its natural host, into mammals to cause outbreaks of varying severity, including pandemics in humans. Despite the laboratory mouse being used as a model to study influenza virus pathogenesis, natural outbreaks of influenza have not been reported in the species. Here, we shed light on one mechanism that might allow mice to be protected from influenza in the wild. We show that virus deposited in the mouse upper respiratory tract will not progress to the lower respiratory tract due to the presence of a potent inhibitor of the virus in saliva. Containing inhibitor-sensitive virus to the upper respiratory tract renders an otherwise lethal infection subclinical. This knowledge sheds light on how natural inhibitors may have evolved to improve survival in this species.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is very little known about the prevalence and distribution of respiratory viruses, other than influenza, in international air travellers and whether symptom screening would aid in the prediction of which travellers are more likely to be infected with specific respiratory viruses. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigate whether, the use of a respiratory symptom screening tool at the border would aid in predicting which travellers are more likely to be infected with specific respiratory viruses. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from travellers arriving at Christchurch International Airport, New Zealand, during the winter 2008, via a symptom questionnaire, temperature testing, and respiratory sampling. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 342 (26.0{\%}) of 1313 samples obtained from 2714 symptomatic travellers. The most frequently identified viruses were rhinoviruses (128), enteroviruses (77) and influenza B (48). The most frequently reported symptoms were stuffy or runny nose (60{\%}), cough (47{\%}), sore throat (27{\%}) and sneezing (24{\%}). Influenza B infections were associated with the highest number of symptoms (mean of 3.4) followed by rhinoviruses (mean of 2.2) and enteroviruses (mean of 1.9). The positive predictive value (PPV) of any symptom for any respiratory virus infection was low at 26{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of respiratory virus infections caused by viruses other than influenza in this study, many with overlapping symptotology to influenza, has important implications for any screening strategies for the prediction of influenza in airline travellers.},

abstract = {Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), targeting the limbic system, is the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the Western world. Two pathways for viral entry to the central nervous system (CNS) in HSE have been suggested: either via the trigeminal nerve or via the olfactory tract. This question remains unsettled, and studies of viral spread between the two brain hemispheres are scarce. Here, we investigated the olfactory infection as a model of infection and tropism of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), the causative agent of HSE, in the CNS of rats. Rats were instilled with HSV-1 in the right nostril and sacrificed 1-6 days post-infection, and tissues were analysed for viral spread using immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). After nasal instillation, HSV-1 infected mitral cells of the olfactory bulb (OB) on the right side only, followed by limbic encephalitis. As a novel finding, the anterior commissure (AC) conveyed a rapid transmission of virus between the right and the left OB, acting as a shortcut also between the olfactory cortices. The neuronal cell population that conveyed the viral infection via the AC was positive for the water channel protein aquaporin 9 (AQP9) by immunohistochemistry. Quantification of AQP9 in cerebrospinal fluid samples of HSE patients showed increment as compared to controls. We conclude that the olfactory route and the AC are important for the spread of HSV-1 within the olfactory/limbic system of rats and furthermore, we suggest that AQP9 is involved in viral tropism and pathogenesis of HSE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Allergic respiratory conditions have been associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection due to impaired interferon (IFN)-related immune responses, but the mechanisms for reinforcement of mucosal immunity against viral infection in allergic diseases are largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether IFN induction would be impaired in allergic nasal mucosa and to identify whether higher loads of influenza A virus (IAV) in allergic nasal mucosa could be controlled with IFN treatment. METHODS: Influenza A virus mRNA, viral titres and IFN expression were compared in IAV-infected normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE, N = 10) and allergic rhinitis nasal epithelial (ARNE, N = 10) cells. We used in vivo model of allergic rhinitis (BALB/c mice, N = 10) and human nasal mucosa from healthy volunteers (N = 72) and allergic rhinitis patients (N = 29) to assess the induction of IFNs after IAV infection. RESULTS: Influenza A virus mRNA levels and viral titres were significantly higher in ARNE compared with NHNE cells. IFN-$\beta$ and IFN-$\lambda$s were induced in NHNE and ARNE cells up to 3 days after IAV infection. Interestingly, induction of IFN-$\lambda$s mRNA levels and the amount of secreted proteins were considerably lower in ARNE cells. The mean IFN-$\lambda$s mRNA level was also significantly lower in the nasal mucosa of AR patients, and we found that recombinant IFN-$\lambda$ treatment attenuated viral mRNA levels and viral titres in IAV-infected ARNE cells. In vivoAR mouse exhibited higher viral load after IAV infection, but intranasal inoculation of IFN-$\lambda$ completely decreased IAV protein expression and viral titre in nasal mucosa of IAV-infected AR mouse. CONCLUSION: Higher susceptibility of the allergic nasal mucosa to IAV may depend on impairment of type III IFN induction, and type III IFN is a key mechanistic link between higher viral loads and control of IAV infection in allergic nasal mucosa.},

In this study, two cell lines were established from the snout and kidney tissue of goldfish, in order to create a biological monitoring tool for viral diseases. Cell lines were optimally maintained at 25 °C in M199 medium supplemented with 15-20 {\%} fetal bovine serum. Chromosomal analysis indicated that both cell lines remained diploid, with a mean chromosomal count of 100. Results of viral inoculation assays revealed that both cell lines shared similar patterns of viral susceptibility and production to infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The viral titers of IPNV in goldfish snout cell line (GFSe) and goldfish kidney cell line (GFKf) reached 10(6.8) and 10(5.9) TCID50/0.1 mL, respectively, within 7 days. The cytopathic effect could be observed when Cyprinid herpesvirus 2 was inoculated into these cells; however, the CPE disappeared after four passages. No CPE was observed in the cells infected by spring viremia carp virus or grass carp reovirus. These newly established cell lines will be a useful diagnostic tool for viral diseases in this fish species and also for the isolation and study of goldfish viruses in future.},

abstract = {Although antibodies against West Nile virus (WNV) have been detected in the sera of dromedaries in the Middle East, North Africa and Spain, no WNV has been isolated or amplified from dromedary or Bactrian camels. In this study, WNV was isolated from Vero cells inoculated with both nasal swab and pooled trachea/lung samples from a dromedary calf in Dubai. Complete-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis using the near-whole-genome polyprotein revealed that the virus belonged to lineage 1a. There was no clustering of the present WNV with other WNVs isolated in other parts of the Middle East. Within lineage 1a, the dromedary WNV occupied a unique position, although it was most closely related to other WNVs of cluster 2. Comparative analysis revealed that the putative E protein encoded by the genome possessed the original WNV E protein glycosylation motif NYS at E154-156, which contained the N-linked glycosylation site at N-154 associated with increased WNV pathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness. In the putative NS1 protein, the A70S substitution observed in other cluster 2 WNVs and P250, which has been implicated in neuroinvasiveness, were present. In addition, the foo motif in the putative NS2A protein, which has been implicated in neuroinvasiveness, was detected. Notably, the amino-acid residues at 14 positions in the present dromedary WNV genome differed from those in most of the closely related WNV strains in cluster 2 of lineage 1a, with the majority of these differences observed in the putative E and NS5 proteins. The present study is the first to demonstrate the isolation of WNV from dromedaries. This finding expands the possible reservoirs of WNV and sources of WNV infection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In head and neck cancer management, immunoexpression of protein p16 is widely used as a surrogate marker for human papillomavirus (HPV) positivity due to challenges of direct HPV testing. Previously p16 has been reported to have good sensitivity but only moderate specificity in HPV-status determination. The aim of this review is to evaluate the existing information on sensitivity and specificity of p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HPV-status determination among the recent studies. RECENT FINDINGS: We searched the time period from October 2014 to April 2016 and included 28 studies (a total of 31 analyses), which reported both p16 and HPV status in their series. The sensitivity of p16 in HPV determination ranged between 28.2 and 100.0{\%}. The mean and median sensitivities were 90.5 and 95.4{\%}, respectively. The specificity ranged between 31.1 and 100.0{\%}. The mean and median specificities were 83.3 and 87.3{\%}, respectively. SUMMARY: Our review presents current information on the feasibility of p16 IHC in HPV status determination, which is in line with previous studies. Patients with HPV-positive tumors can be identified with p16 IHC, but a risk for misclassification of HPV-negative tumors as HPV positive exists. This fact has to be taken into consideration if HPV status will influence treatment planning.},

abstract = {A large subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) is associated with HPV infection and has better outcome than non-viral-related tumors. Various malignancies also carry a role for TLRs, key activators of inflammation and innate immunity. We examined the expression of TLRs in OPSCC, and their association with HPV status and treatment outcome. TLR 5, 7, 9, and p16 were studied by immunohistochemistry and HPV status was detected with in situ hybridization in 202 tumors of consecutively treated OPSCC patients using tissue microarray method. The relations between TLR expression and HPV status, p16 expression, clinicopathological factors, and survival were analyzed. TLR 5, 7, and 9 expression patterns differed between HPV-positive and -negative tumors, and they were statistically significantly associated with history of smoking, heavy drinking, tumor site, grade, size (T), metastasis (N), and stage. Moreover, in HPV-positive tumors the expression of TLR 5 and 7 correlated with tumor recurrence. After adjustment, among HPV-positive OPSCC patients, high TLR 5 and low TLR 7 expression were associated with poor disease-specific survival. Our results indicate that TLR 5 and 7 may have a role in the prognostication of HPV-positive OPSCC, however, further studies are needed to clarify the comprehensive role of these TLRs in OPSCC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute rhinosinusitis is a frequent inflammatory disease of the mucosa of the nose and paranasal sinuses, usually associated with substantial morbidity having considerable socioeconomic impact. A new herbal drug based on a dry extract of a combination of 5 medicinal drugs (Sinupret{\textregistered} extract Dragees) was tested in a confirmatory trial in patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis. METHODS: 386 patients with symptomatic acute viral rhinosinusitis have been treated with the herbal drug combination (daily dosage 3 × 160 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial for 15 days. Primary efficacy endpoint was the investigator assessed symptom score at the end of therapy (Major Symptom Score, MSSINV). RESULTS: Treatment with verum lead to a statistically significant, clinically relevant improvement of the symptom score (2.07 ± 0.18 [SEM] vs. 3.47 ± 0.28 score points, p = 0.0001; PP: N = 300) compared to placebo at visit 5. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) was 7 (PP). Adverse events occurred in 9.8{\%} of the patients treated with verum and 14.1{\%} of the patients treated with placebo. No serious adverse event was observed. The investigators assessed the tolerability of the herbal drug combination predominantly as good and very good (96.4{\%} verum, 95.3{\%} placebo). CONCLUSION: The results prove the efficacy and tolerability of the herbal drug in the indication acute viral rhinosinusitis. Especially due to the favorable benefit-risk ratio the drug represents a suitable treatment alternative.},

abstract = {Intestinal goblet cells secret mucins to form mucus layers critical for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes watery diarrhea and high mortality of suckling pigs. PEDV mainly infects villous epithelial cells of the small intestine, and infected cells undergo acute, massive necrosis, followed by severe villous atrophy. Conventional 9-day-old nursing pigs [PEDV-inoculated (n=9); Mock (n=11)] and 26-day-old weaned [PEDV-inoculated (n=11); Mock (n=9)] were inoculated orally [8.9 log(10) genomic equivalents/pig] with PEDV strain PC21A or mock. We used alcian blue or Periodic-Acid-Schiff staining for the detection of acidic or neutral mucin-secreting goblet cells in the small intestine. We demonstrated that PEDV infection of the nursing pigs at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 1-5 and weaned pigs at PIDs 3-5 led to depletion or significant reduction in the number of goblet cells (and also the number of villous goblet cells normalized by jejunal villous crypt height to crypt depth ratios) in the villi or crypts. These findings coincided with the development of intestinal villous atrophy. By immunohistochemistry, a few PEDV antigen-positive goblet cells were identified in the jejunal or ileal villous epithelium of the infected nursing or weaned pigs. During the early stages of PEDV infection, goblet cell mucins in the small intestine may be decreased, possibly leading to an impaired mucus layer and increased susceptibility to secondary enteric bacterial infection.},

Additionally, to elevate the efficacy of the HTLV-1 vaccine, the chimera was physically mixed with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) or ISCOMATRIX (IMX) adjuvants. For this purpose, the ISCOMATRIX with a size range of 40-60 nm were prepared using lipid film hydration method. Our investigation revealed that the mixture of IMX and chimera could significantly increase antibody titers containing IgG2a, and mucosal IgA, as well as IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-10 cytokines and decrease the level of TGF-$\beta$1, compared to other vaccine formulations. The intranasal delivery of chimera vaccine in the absence or presence adjuvants stimulated potent mucosal sIgA titer relative to subcutaneous immunization. Furthermore, the SC or nasal delivery of various vaccine formulations could shift the immunity toward cell-mediated responses, as evident by higher IgG2a and IFN-$\gamma$, as well as suppressed TGF-$\beta$1 level. Our findings suggest that proper design, construction, and immunization of multi-epitope vaccine are essential for developing an effective HTLV-1 vaccine.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2008, a program to eradicate bovine virus diarrhea (BVD) in cattle in Switzerland was initiated. After targeted elimination of persistently infected animals that represent the main virus reservoir, the absence of BVD is surveilled serologically since 2012. In view of steadily decreasing pestivirus seroprevalence in the cattle population, the susceptibility for (re-) infection by border disease (BD) virus mainly from small ruminants increases. Due to serological cross-reactivity of pestiviruses, serological surveillance of BVD by ELISA does not distinguish between BVD and BD virus as source of infection. RESULTS: In this work the cross-serum neutralisation test (SNT) procedure was adapted to the epidemiological situation in Switzerland by the use of three pestiviruses, i.e., strains representing the subgenotype BVDV-1a, BVDV-1h and BDSwiss-a, for adequate differentiation between BVDV and BDV. Thereby the BDV-seroprevalence in seropositive cattle in Switzerland was determined for the first time. Out of 1,555 seropositive blood samples taken from cattle in the frame of the surveillance program, a total of 104 samples (6.7{\%}) reacted with significantly higher titers against BDV than BVDV. These samples originated from 65 farms and encompassed 15 different cantons with the highest BDV-seroprevalence found in Central Switzerland. On the base of epidemiological information collected by questionnaire in case- and control farms, common housing of cattle and sheep was identified as the most significant risk factor for BDV infection in cattle by logistic regression. CONCLUSION: This indicates that pestiviruses from sheep should be considered as a source of infection of domestic cattle and might well impede serological BVD surveillance.},

abstract = {H9N2 avian influenza viruses are present in poultry worldwide. These viruses are considered to have pandemic potential, because recent isolates can recognize human-type receptor and several sporadic human infections have been reported. In this study, we aimed to identify mutations related to mammalian adaptation of H9N2 influenza virus. We found that mouse-adapted viruses had several mutations in hemagglutinin (HA), PB2, PA, and PB1. Among the detected mutations, PB1-K577E was a novel mutation that had not been previously reported to involve mammalian adaptation. A recombinant H9N2 virus bearing only the PB1-K577E mutation showed enhanced pathogenicity in mice, with increased virus titers in nasal turbinates compared to that in mice infected with the wild-type virus. In addition, the PB1-K577E mutation increased virus polymerase activity in human cell culture at a lower temperature. These data suggest that the PB1-K577E mutation is a novel pathogenicity determinant of H9N2 virus in mice and could be a signature for mammalian adaptation.},

abstract = {Disruption of nasal epithelial tight junctions (TJs) and ciliary dysfunction are found in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and nasal polyps (NPs), along with an increase of p63-positive basal cells and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. To investigate these mechanisms, primary cultures of HNECs transfected with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT-HNECs) were transfected with siRNAs of TAp63 and $\Delta$Np63, treated with the NF-kB inhibitor curucumin and inhibitors of HDACs, and infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In TERT-HNECs, knockdown of p63 by siRNAs of TAp63 and $\Delta$Np63, induced claudin-1 and -4 with Sp1 activity and enhanced barrier and fence functions. The knockdown of p63 enhanced the number of microvilli with the presence of cilia-like structures. Treatment with curcumin and inhibitors of HDACs, or infection with RSV prevented expression of p63 with an increase of claudin-4 and the number of microvilli. The knockdown or downregulation of p63 inhibited phospho-p38MAPK, and the p38MAPK inhibitor downregulated p63 and upregulated the barrier function. Thus, epithelial barrier and ciliogenesis of nasal epithelium are regulated in a p63-negative manner in normal and upper airway diseases. Understanding of the regulation of p63/p38 MAPK/NF-$\kappa$B may be important in the therapy for airway allergy and its drug delivery system.},

abstract = {An acute viral respiratory tract infection might prevent infections by other viruses because of the antiviral innate immune response. However, with the use of PCR methods, simultaneous detection of two or more respiratory viruses is frequent. We analysed the effect of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on the occurrence of simultaneous rhinovirus (RV) infection in children within a birth cohort study setting. We used PCR for virus detection in nasal swabs collected from children with an acute respiratory tract infection at the age of 0-24 months and from healthy control children, who were matched for age and date of sample collection. Of 226 children with RSV infections, 18 (8.0{\%}) had co-infections with RV, whereas RV was detected in 31 (14{\%}) of 226 control children (p 0.049 by chi-square test). Adjustment for sex, number of siblings and socio-economic status strengthened the negative association between RSV and RV (OR 0.46, 95{\%} CI 0.24-0.90; p 0.02). The median durations of symptoms (cough, rhinorrhoea, or fever) were 11 days in children with single RSV infections and 14 days in children with RSV-RV co-infections (p 0.02). Our results suggest that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of RV infection, but that, if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms.},

The WHO was notified of 27 countries have reported cases of MERS, the majority of these cases occur in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Dromedary camels are likely to be the main source of Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) infection in humans. METHODS: MERS-CoV infection rates among camels in livestock markets and slaughterhouses were investigated in Saudi Arabia. A total of 698 nasal swabs were collected and examined with Rapid assay and rtRT-PCR. Ten MERS-CoV positive samples were subjected to full genomic sequencing. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of the Rapid immunochromatographic assay (BioNote, South Korea) was evaluated as a diagnostic tool for MERS-CoV compared to rtRT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed a high percentage of dromedaries (56.4{\%}) had evidence for nasal MERS-CoV infection. Phylogenetic analysis of the ten MERS-CoV isolates showed that the sequences were closely related to the other MERS-CoV strains recovered from camels and human cases. Moreover, the results showed that 195 samples were positive for MERS-CoV by rapid assay compared to 394 positive samples of rtRT-PCR, which showed low rapid assay sensitivity (49.49{\%}) while, the specificity were found to be 100{\%}. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that these sites are a highly-hazardous to zoonotic diseases.},

HRV 3C protease, which is responsible for cleavage of viral polyprotein in to proteins essential for viral life-cycle, represents an important target. We have designed proline- and azetidine-based analogues of Rupintrivir that target the P2 pocket of the binding site. Potency optimization, aided with X-ray crystallography and quantum mechanical calculations, led to compounds with activity against a broad spectrum of HRV serotypes. Altogether, these compounds represent alternative starting points to identify promising leads in our continual efforts to treat HRV infections.},

We have validated qicPCR detection of RSV in spiked nasal wash aspirates and demonstrate that the qicPCR assay is 94{\%} concordant with RSV plaque assay data in nasal wash samples from 53 RSV inoculated human volunteers in the hVCM. The use of qicPCR for informed dosing was successfully implemented in a recent clinical trial demonstrating efficacy of the RSV entry inhibitor GS-5806 in the hVCM (NCT01756482). Comparison of qicPCR positivity in relation to nasal wash viral load measured by both RT-qPCR and plaque assay shows that the therapeutic exposure was correctly initiated prior to onset and peak of RSV viral shedding and symptoms in the majority of volunteers.},

Common complications following filler injections include bruising, itching, infections, allergic reactions, and tissue necrosis. This case is the first report of Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis as a possible complication of dermal filler injection. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old woman with no past medical history presented with altered mental state, headaches, and seizures. She had a nasal dermal filler injection for aesthetic purpose five weeks before her acute presentation. A diagnosis of HSV-1 encephalitis was made based on brain imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that showed bilateral frontotemporal lobe hyperintensity. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) confirmed the presence of HSV-1 DNA. Despite anti-viral treatment with acyclovir, she developed postencephalitic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights the possibility that among the complications of the use of cosmetic dermal fillers, the transmission of HSV-1 and the development of HSV-1 encephalitis should be recognized.},

abstract = {In a multi-center, prospective, observational study over two influenza seasons, we sought to quantify and correlate the amount of virus recovered from the nares of infected subjects with that recovered from their immediate environment in community and hospital settings. We recorded the symptoms of adults and children with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, took nasal swabs, and sampled touched surfaces and room air. Forty-two infected subjects were followed up. The mean duration of virus shedding was 6.2 days by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and 4.2 days by culture. Surface swabs were collected from 39 settings; 16 (41{\%}) subject locations were contaminated with virus. Overall, 33 of the 671 (4.9{\%}) surface swabs were PCR positive for influenza, of which two (0.3{\%}) yielded viable virus. On illness Day 3, subjects yielding positive surface samples had significantly higher nasal viral loads (geometric mean ratio 25.7; 95{\%} CI 1.75, 376.0, p=0.021) and a positive correlation (r=0.47, p=0.006) was observed between subject nasal viral loads and viral loads recovered from the surfaces around them. Room air was sampled in the vicinity of 12 subjects, and PCR positive samples were obtained for five (42{\%}) samples. Influenza virus shed by infected subjects did not detectably contaminate the vast majority of surfaces sampled. We question the relative importance of the indirect contact transmission of influenza via surfaces, though our data support the existence of super-spreaders via this route. The air sampling results add to the accumulating evidence that supports the potential for droplet nuclei (aerosol) transmission of influenza.},

abstract = {We studied the relative roles of Duox2-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in host defense against influenza A virus (IAV) infection in normal human nasal epithelial cells and mouse nasal mucosa. We found that Duox2 primarily generated ROS rapidly after IAV infection in normal human nasal epithelial cells and that knockdown of Duox2 aggravated IAV infection. In addition, Duox2-derived ROS enhancement significantly suppressed IAV infection in nasal epithelium. In particular, Duox2-derived ROS were required for the induction of retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) transcription. After intranasal IAV inoculation into mice, viral infection was significantly aggravated from 3 days postinoculation (dpi) in the nasal mucosa, and the IAV viral titer was highest at 7 dpi. Both RIG-I and MDA5 messenger RNA levels increased dominantly in mouse nasal mucosa from 3 dpi; consistent with this, RIG-I and MDA5 proteins were also induced after IAV infection. RIG-I and MDA5 messenger RNA levels were induced to a lower extent in the nasal mucosa of the mice that were inoculated with Duox2 short hairpin RNA, and the IAV viral titer was significantly higher in nasal lavage. Taken together, Duox2-derived ROS are necessary for the innate immune response and trigger the induction of RIG-I and MDA5 to resist IAV infection in human nasal epithelium and mouse nasal mucosa.},

abstract = {Rationale: Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) provides an important mechanism for resisting infectious pathogens within the respiratory tract, and accordingly, the in situ analysis of H(2)O(2) generation in real time provides a valuable tool for assessing immune response. Methods: In this study, we applied a chemiluminescent nanoparticle-based real-time imaging approach to noninvasive evaluation of the Duox2-mediated H(2)O(2) generation after viral infection, and assessed its usefulness for analytical purposes in mouse nasal mucosa. The chemiluminescent nanoprobe employed herein (BioNT) possesses appropriate physicochemical properties, such as high sensitivity and selectivity toward H(2)O(2), no background noise, deliverability to the respiratory tract, and capability of multiple injections to a single animal subject for long-term repetitive imaging. Results: The favorable characteristics of BioNT allowed for a longitudinal study with the same mice to noninvasively evaluate the long-term evolution of endogenous H(2)O(2) in the nasal epithelium after infection with influenza A virus (WS/33/H1N1). We found that nasal epithelial cells by themselves respond to viral infection by generating H(2)O(2), and that the in vivo cumulative H(2)O(2) level in the nasal mucosa peaks at day 3 post-infection. Such in vitro and in vivo temporal behaviors of the endogenous H(2)O(2) generation showed a good correlation with those of Duox2 expression after infection. This correlation could be further confirmed with Duox2-deficient subjects (Duox2-knockdown NHNE cells and Duox2-knockout mutant mice) where no H(2)O(2)-induced chemiluminescence was detectable even after viral infection. Importantly, upon knock-down of Duox2 expression, the condition of mice caused by viral infection in the upper airway was significantly aggravated, evidencing the involvement of Duox2 in the immune defense. Conclusion: All these results reveal a critical role of Duox2 in the infection-induced H(2)O(2) production and the H(2)O(2)-mediated immune response to infection in the respiratory tract, well elucidating the potential of BioNT as a noninvasive tool for fundamental in vivo studies of infectious diseases.},

We compared the infectivity and pathogenesis of H5N1 virus in domestic cats and dogs to find out which animal is more susceptible to H5N1 influenza virus. When cats and dogs were infected with the H5N1 virus, cats suffered from severe outcomes including death, whereas dogs did not show any mortality. Viruses were shed in the nose and rectum of cats and in the nose of dogs. Viruses were detected in brain, lung, kidney, intestine, liver, and serum in the infected cats, but only in the lung in the infected dogs. Genes encoding inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, Toll-like receptors, and apoptotic factors were more highly expressed in the lungs of cats than in those of dogs. Our results suggest that the intensive monitoring of dogs is necessary to prevent human infection by H5N1 influenza virus, since infected dogs may not show clear clinical signs, in contrast to infected cats.},

abstract = {Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a causative agent of respiratory and enteric diseases in cattle and calves. BCoV infection was also evident in captive wild ruminants. Recently, water deer are recognized as the most common wildlife to approach farmhouses and livestock barns in Korea. Therefore, we investigated 77 nasal swab samples from non-captive wild water deer (Hydropotes inermis) between November 2016 and September 2017 and identified three samples positive for coronavirus, indicating potential for respiratory shedding. The full genomic sequences of the water deer coronavirus were closely related to BCoV ({\textgreater}98{\%}). Therefore, effective biosecurity system in bovine farms would be necessary to prevent contact between farm ruminants and free-ranging wild water deer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Rhinoviruses (RV), which are responsible for the majority of common colds, induce mucus overproduction, increased vascular permeability, and secondary bacterial infection. These symptoms are primarily caused by barrier function disruption, which is controlled by intercellular junctions. In this study, we investigated whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely involved in tight junction disruption of primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells induced by infection of RV . METHODS AND RESULTS: Incubation with RV resulted in disruption of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, E-cadherin, claudin-1, and occludin) in HNE cells. Pretreatment with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) decreased RV-induced disruption of tight junction in HNE cells. RV-induced generation of ROS was diminished by DPI. However, rotenone was not inhibited in HNE cells following incubation with RV. Rhinoviruses resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatases activity and an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels in HNE cells. Diphenylene iodonium inhibited the RV-induced inactivation of phosphatases and phosphorylation of protein tyrosine. In addition, inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases with phenylarsine oxide resulted in a marked decrease in protein phosphatase activity and disruption of tight junction proteins in HNE cells. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ROS-mediated inhibition of phosphatases plays a crucial role in disruption of tight junctions in HNE cells by RV. The data suggest that RV infection may damage nasal epithelial barrier function. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 128:E393-E401, 2018.},

abstract = {The innate immune system of the nasal epithelium serves as a first line of defense against invading respiratory viruses including influenza A virus (IAV). Recently, it was verified that interferon (IFN)-related immune responses play a critical role in local antiviral innate immunity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by exogenous pathogens has also been demonstrated in respiratory epithelial cells and modulation of ROS has been reported to be important for respiratory virus-induced innate immune mechanisms. Passage-2 normal human nasal epithelial (NHNE) cells were inoculated with IAV (WS/33, H1N1) to assess the sources of IAV-induced ROS and the relationship between ROS and IFN-related innate immune responses. Both STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and the mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes, including Mx1, 2,5-OAS1, IFIT1, and CXCL10, were induced after IAV infection up to three days post infection. Similarly, we observed that mitochondrial ROS generation increased maximally at 2 days after IAV infection. After suppression of mitochondrial ROS generation, IAV-induced phosphorylation of STAT and mRNA levels of IFN-stimulated genes were attenuated and actually, viral titers of IAV were significantly higher in cases with scavenging ROS. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial ROS might be responsible for controlling IAV infection and may be potential sources of ROS generation, which is required to initiate an innate immune response in NHNE cells.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) exhibit great biological heterogeneity and relatively poor prognosis. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is involved in the cause of the majority of these cancers, but over the last several years, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection has increased specifically in oropharyngeal cancers and become an additional risk factor. Here, we evaluated the number of Langerhans cells (LCs) in HNSCC and reporting its prognostic power in comparison to other risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our clinical series was composed of 25 tumor-free peritumoral epithelium, 64 low-grade dysplasia, 54 high-grade dysplasia and 125 carcinoma samples. HPV was detected by E6/E7 qPCR and p16 immunohistochemistry. CD1a-positive LCs were counted in intra-tumoral and stromal compartments as well as lymph nodes. MIP-3$\alpha$ was assessed in carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that high LC number is associated with longer recurrence-free survival in both intra-tumoral and stromal compartments and longer overall survival in stromal compartment. Tobacco and alcohol habits, but not HPV status, are also correlated with poor prognoses in terms of recurrence. Multivariate analyses reported stromal LC number as a strong prognostic factor independent of tobacco, alcohol and HPV status. Moreover, LC number is higher in tumors and invaded lymph nodes than dysplastic lesions but it decreases in HPV-positive cancer patients. Further, LC number correlates with MIP-3$\alpha$ expression. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that LC number is a significant and independent prognostic factor for HNSCC. LC infiltration is increased in cancer lesions but decrease with HPV infection.},

abstract = {Human papilloma virus-like particles (HPV VLP) serve as the basis of the current licensed vaccines for HPV. We have previously shown that encapsidation of DNA expressing the model antigen M/M2 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in HPV pseudovirions (PsV) is immunogenic when delivered intravaginally. Because the HPV capsids confer tropism for basal epithelium, they represent attractive carriers for vaccination targeted to the skin using microneedles. In this study we asked: 1) whether HPV16 VLP administered by microneedles could induce protective immune responses to HPV16 and 2) whether HPV16 PsV-encapsidated plasmids delivered by microneedles could elicit immune responses to both HPV and the antigen delivered by the transgene. Mice immunized with HPV16 VLP coated microneedles generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were protected from HPV16 challenge. Microneedle arrays coated with HPV16-M/M2 or HPV16-F protein (genes of RSV) were then tested and dose-dependent HPV and F-specific antibody responses were detected post-immunization, and M/M2-specific T-cell responses were detected post RSV challenge, respectively. HPV16 PsV-F immunized mice were fully protected from challenge with HPV16 PsV and had reduced RSV viral load in lung and nose upon intranasal RSV challenge. In summary, HPV16 PsV-encapsidated DNA delivered by microneedles induced neutralizing antibody responses against HPV and primed for antibody and T-cell responses to RSV antigens encoded by the encapsidated plasmids. Although the immunogenicity of the DNA component was just above the dose response threshold, the HPV-specific immunity was robust. Taken together, these data suggest microneedle delivery of lyophilized HPV PsV could provide a practical, thermostable combined vaccine approach that could be developed for clinical evaluation.},

abstract = {Broadly reactive antibodies targeting the conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stalk region are elicited following sequential infection or vaccination with influenza viruses belonging to divergent subtypes and/or expressing antigenically distinct HA globular head domains. Here, we demonstrate, through the use of novel chimeric HA proteins and competitive binding assays, that sequential infection of ferrets with antigenically distinct seasonal H1N1 (sH1N1) influenza virus isolates induced an HA stalk-specific antibody response. Additionally, stalk-specific antibody titers were boosted following sequential infection with antigenically distinct sH1N1 isolates in spite of preexisting, cross-reactive, HA-specific antibody titers. Despite a decline in stalk-specific serum antibody titers, sequential sH1N1 influenza virus-infected ferrets were protected from challenge with a novel H1N1 influenza virus (A/California/07/2009), and these ferrets poorly transmitted the virus to naive contacts. Collectively, these findings indicate that HA stalk-specific antibodies are commonly elicited in ferrets following sequential infection with antigenically distinct sH1N1 influenza virus isolates lacking HA receptor-binding site cross-reactivity and can protect ferrets against a pathogenic novel H1N1 virus. IMPORTANCE: The influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) is a major target of the humoral immune response following infection and/or seasonal vaccination. While antibodies targeting the receptor-binding pocket of HA possess strong neutralization capacities, these antibodies are largely strain specific and do not confer protection against antigenic drift variant or novel HA subtype-expressing viruses. In contrast, antibodies targeting the conserved stalk region of HA exhibit broader reactivity among viruses within and among influenza virus subtypes. Here, we show that sequential infection of ferrets with antigenically distinct seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses boosts the antibody responses directed at the HA stalk region. Moreover, ferrets possessing HA stalk-specific antibody were protected against novel H1N1 virus infection and did not transmit the virus to naive contacts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The pathogenesis of sinonasal polyposis remains unclear, in spite of several investigative approaches. Antrochoanal polyps, a subgroup of sinonasal polyposis along with allergic- and chronic-inflammatory nasal polyps, mostly originate from the maxillary sinus and develop as a unilateral, pedunculated mass towards the nasopharynx. The human papillomavirus (HPV) is discussed as a possible causative and influencing factor in development and progression of sinonasal polyposis. This study aims to elucidate HPV frequency in nasal polyps and antrochoanal polyps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 257 tissue specimens (166 nasal polyps, 39 antrochoanal polyps and 52 nasal turbinates) was subjected to three different established HPV- polymerase chain reaction assays, testing for 37 low- and high-risk HPV. In addition, immunohistochemical analyses for HPV16 were carried out, as well as immunohistochemistry and western blots of p16, a biomarker for HPV induced cancer. RESULTS: HPV-DNA was detected in 53.8{\%} of antrochoanal polyps, 15.1{\%} of nasal polyps, and 5.8{\%} of nasal turbinates. HPV16 was the predominant type with a detection rate of 76{\%} in nasal polyps and 62{\%} in antrochoanal polyps. Immunohistochemically, HPV positive tissues stained positive for HPV16 antigens and p16 in epithelial cell layers. No significant p16 overexpression was traceable in antrochoanal polyps, nasal polyps and nasal turbinates by western blot. There was no correlation of HPV-status with sex, age, smoking, alcohol consumption or allergic background. CONCLUSION: The present study shows a significant frequency of high-risk type HPV16 in antrochoanal polyps. Absence of oncogenic transformation or correlation of the HPV-status with clinical data suggests a latent superinfection, possibly because of anatomical proximity to the oropharynx.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses of the H1N1 subtype have emerged from the avian influenza gene pool in aquatic birds and caused human pandemics at least twice during the past century. Despite this fact, surprisingly little is known about the H1N1 gene pool in the aquatic bird reservoir. A preliminary study showed that an H1N1 virus from a shorebird of the Charadriiformes order was transmitted between animals through the airborne route of infection, whereas an H1N1 virus from a bird of the Anseriformes order was not. Here we show that two of the three H1N1 viruses isolated from Charadriiformes species in 2009 were transmitted between animals through the airborne route of infection, and five H1N1 isolates from Anseriformes species were not. The one H1N1 virus from a Charadriiformes species that failed to transmit through the airborne route was a reassortant possessing multiple internal gene segments from Anseriformes species. The molecular differences between the airborne-transmissible and non-airborne-transmissible H1N1 viruses were multigenic, involving the selection of virus with human-like receptor-binding specificity ($\alpha$2-6 sialic acid) and multiple differences in the polymerase complex, mainly in the PB2, PB1-F2, and nonstructural genes.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Naturally, development of adaptive immunity following HRV infection affects the immune response. However, it is currently unclear whether or not HRV re-exposure within a short time frame leads to an altered innate immune response. The "experimental cold model" is used to investigate the pathogenesis of HRV infection and allows us to investigate the effects of repeated exposure on both local and systemic innate immunity. METHODS: 40 healthy male and female (1:1) subjects were nasally inoculated with HRV-16 or placebo. One week later, all subjects received HRV-16. Baseline seronegative subjects (n = 18) were included for further analysis. RESULTS: Infection rate was 82{\%}. Primary HRV infection induced a marked increase in viral load and IP-10 levels in nasal wash, while a similar trend was observed for IL-6 and IL-10. Apart from an increase in IP-10 plasma levels, HRV infection did not induce systemic immune effects nor lower respiratory tract inflammation. With similar viral load present during the second HRV challenge, IP-10 and IL-6 in nasal wash showed no increase, but gradually declined, with a similar trend for IL-10. CONCLUSION: Upon a second HRV challenge one week after the first, a less pronounced response for several innate immune parameters is observed. This could be the result of immunological tolerance and possibly increases vulnerability towards secondary infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the etiological role of human papilloma virus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) and -7 (HHV-7) in the occurrence of nasal polyposis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nasal polyp samples from 30 patients with nasal polyposis and normal nasal mucosa from 10 patients without nasal polyps were obtained. DNA was extracted from tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for all runs. RESULTS: No HSV-1, HSV-2, or VZV was detected in the samples. Among the patient samples, EBV and HHV-7 DNA were detected in 18 (60{\%}), HHV-6 was detected in 20 (66.7{\%}), and HPV was detected in 4 (13.3{\%}) samples. Among the controls, CMV DNA was positive in one (10{\%}). EBV was positive in 5 (50{\%}), HHV-6 and HHV-7 were positive in 7 (70{\%}), and HPV was positive in 2 (20{\%}) samples. No significant difference was found among the groups with any test in terms of positivity. CONCLUSION: The association of Herpesviridae and HPV with the pathogenesis of nasal polyps was investigated in this study and no relationship was found. Thus, these viruses do not play a significant role in the formation of nasal polyps.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recognizing increasing interest in community disease surveillance globally, the goal of this study was to investigate whether respiratory viruses circulating in the community may be represented through clinical (hospital) surveillance in Nigeria. RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1{\%}) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9{\%}). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8{\%} (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7{\%} (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p {\textless} 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3{\%}, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community. This pilot study provides evidence that data from the community can potentially represent different information than that sourced clinically, suggesting the need for community surveillance to enhance public health efforts and scientific understanding of respiratory infections.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) produces variable lung disease phenotypes that are, in part, independent of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR) genotype. Transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$) is the best described genetic modifier of the CF phenotype, but its mechanism of action is unknown. We hypothesized that TGF$\beta$ is sufficient to drive pathognomonic features of CF lung disease in vivo and that CFTR deficiency enhances susceptibility to pathological TGF$\beta$ effects. A CF mouse model and littermate controls were exposed intratracheally to an adenoviral vector containing the TGF$\beta$1 cDNA (Ad-TGF$\beta$), empty vector, or PBS only. Studies were performed 1 wk after treatment, including lung mechanics, collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and analysis of lung histology, RNA, and protein. CF and non-CF mice showed similar weight loss, inflammation, goblet cell hyperplasia, and Smad pathway activation after Ad-TGF$\beta$ treatment. Ad-TGF$\beta$ produced greater abnormalities in lung mechanics in CF versus control mice, which was uniquely associated with induction of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. CFTR transcripts were reduced, and epithelial sodium channel transcripts were increased in CF and non-CF mice, whereas the goblet cell transcription factors, forkhead ortholog A3 and SAM-pointed domain-containing ETS-like factor, were increased in non-CF but not CF mice following Ad-TGF$\beta$ treatment. Pulmonary TGF$\beta$1 expression was sufficient to produce pulmonary remodeling and abnormalities in lung mechanics that were associated with both shared and unique cell signaling pathway activation in CF and non-CF mice. These results highlight the multifunctional impact of TGF$\beta$ on pulmonary pathology in vivo and identify cellular-response differences that may impact CF lung pathology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An opportunistic oral pathogen, Treponema denticola (Td), has been linked to orodigestive carcinogenesis, but its role in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has remained open. We evaluated the presence of Td chymotrypsin-like protease (Td-CTLP) in a series of 201 unselected consecutive OPSCC patients, and the relation of the Td-CTLP to human papillomavirus (HPV) status, to expression of toll-like receptors (TLR) 5, 7, and 9, and to clinical parameters and patient outcome. METHODS: Clinicopathological data came from hospital registries. The expression of cell surface-bound Td-CTLP was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Immunoexpression of TLRs 5, 7, and 9, and HPV status we studied earlier in this patient series. RESULTS: We detected Td-CTLP in 81{\%} of the OPSCC, and especially in HPV-negative tumours (48{\%} of all OPSCCs). Among the HPV-positive tumours (52{\%} of all OPSCCs), low Td-CTLP expression associated with low TLR 5 and high TLR 7 expression. Among those HPV-negative, higher TLR 5 and lower TLR 7 expression associated with high Td-CTLP expression. Strong Td-CTLP expression associated with poor disease-specific survival, but no similar association among HPV-positive and HPV-negative subgroups emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Td-CTLP was highly expressed in OPSCC and was associated with the HPV status of tumour tissue.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus infections do not only cause common colds, but may also trigger severe exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Even though rhinoviruses have been the focus of extensive drug development efforts in the past, an anti-rhinoviral drug still has to make it to the market. In the past, the viral capsid protein VP1 has been shown to be an important target for the development of antiviral molecules. Furthermore, many different chemical scaffolds appear to possess the properties that are required to inhibit virus replication by this mechanism of action. I-6602, an analogue of the rhinovirus inhibitor pirodavir, was previously identified as a potent inhibitor of rhinovirus infection. Here, we describe the antiviral activity of its analogue ca603, a molecule with a modified linker structure, and corroborate its mechanism of action as a capsid binder. FINDINGS: The molecule ca603 shows antiviral activity against a panel of rhino-and enteroviruses. Cross-resistance is observed against viruses with mutations that render them resistant to the inhibitory effect of the capsid binder pleconaril and thermostability assays demonstrate that the compound binds and stabilizes the viral capsid. Binding of the molecule to the VP1 protein is corroborated by in silico modeling. CONCLUSIONS: It is confirmed that ca603 inhibits rhinovirus replication by interaction with the VP1 protein and, by this, allows to further expand the chemical diversity of capsid-binding molecules.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to elucidate possible differences in antiviral defense in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) mucosal tissue compared to healthy mucosal tissue (HMT) upon herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) exposure. METHODOLOGY: HMT and CRSwNP samples were infected with HSV1. We visualized the virus location by immunofluorescence and monitored invasion by a score. The mediators Interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$, IFN-$\beta$, IFN-$\lambda$, IFN-$\gamma$, Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1$\beta$, Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, IL-17, IL-5, IL-10 were measured in culture supernatants at baseline and at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after virus incubation. RESULTS: CRSwNP mucosal tissue showed a significant deficit in IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-17 release within 24 to 72 hours after infection in comparison to HMT, at the same time releasing significantly more pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$. These findings were associated with significantly higher viral invasion scores at 48 and 72 h in CRSwNP mucosa compared to those for the HMT. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time in a human ex-vivo mucosal model that the inadequate response of CRSwNP may be associated with a deeper intrusion of viruses into the mucosal tissue, and may contribute to more and longer symptoms upon acute infection, but also to the persistence of inflammation in CRSwNP tissue.},

abstract = {Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) is a B cell-tropic gammaherpesvirus that can be studied in vivo Despite viral evasion, type I interferons (IFN-I) limit its spread. After MuHV-4 inoculation into footpads, IFN-I protect lymph node subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSM) against productive infection; after peritoneal inoculation, they protect splenic marginal zone macrophages, and they limit MuHV-4 replication in the lungs. While invasive infections can be used to test specific aspects of host colonization, it is also important to understand natural infection. MuHV-4 taken up spontaneously by alert mice enters them via olfactory neurons. We determined how IFN-I act in this context. Blocking IFN-I signaling did not increase neuronal infection but allowed the virus to spread to the adjacent respiratory epithelium. In lymph nodes, a complete IFN-I signaling block increased MuHV-4 lytic infection in SSM and increased the number of dendritic cells (DC) expressing viral green fluorescent protein (GFP) independently of lytic infection. A CD11c(+) cell-directed signaling block increased infection of DC only. However, this was sufficient to increase downstream infection, consistent with DC providing the main viral route to B cells. The capacity of IFN-I to limit DC infection indicated that viral IFN-I evasion was only partly effective. Therefore, DC are a possible target for IFN-I-based interventions to reduce host colonization.IMPORTANCE Human gammaherpesviruses infect B cells and cause B cell cancers. Interventions to block virus binding to B cells have not stopped their infection. Therefore, we must identify other control points that are relevant to natural infection. Human infections are difficult to analyze. However, gammaherpesviruses colonize all mammals. A related gammaherpesvirus of mice reaches B cells not directly but via infected dendritic cells. We show that type I interferons, an important general antiviral defense, limit gammaherpesvirus B cell infection by acting on dendritic cells. Therefore, dendritic cell infection is a potential point of interferon-based therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine host and pathogen factors predictive of outcomes in a large clinical cohort with keratoconjunctivitis. DESIGN: Retrospective analyses of the clinical and molecular data from a randomized, controlled, masked trial for auricloscene for keratoconjunctivitis (NVC-422 phase IIB, NovaBay; clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01877694). PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred participants from United States, India, Brazil, and Sri Lanka with clinical diagnosis of keratoconjunctivitis and positive rapid test results for adenovirus. METHODS: Clinical signs and symptoms and bilateral conjunctival swabs were obtained on days 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed to detect and quantify adenovirus in all samples. Regression models were used to evaluate the association of various variables with keratoconjunctivitis outcomes. Time to resolution of each symptom or sign was assessed by adenoviral species with Cox regression. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The difference in composite scores of clinical signs between days 1 and 18, mean visual acuity change between days 1 and 18, and time to resolution of each symptom or sign. RESULTS: Of 500 participants, 390 (78{\%}) showed evidence of adenovirus by PCR. Among adenovirus-positive participants, adenovirus D species was most common (63{\%} of total cases), but a total of 4 species and 21 different types of adenovirus were detected. Adenovirus D was associated with more severe signs and symptoms, a higher rate of subepithelial infiltrate development, and a slower decline in viral load compared with all other adenovirus species. The clinical courses of all patients with non-adenovirus D species infection and adenovirus-negative keratoconjunctivitis were similar. Mean change in visual acuity between days 1 and 18 was a gain of 1.9 letters; worse visual outcome was associated with older age. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of keratoconjunctivitis is not associated with a detectable adenovirus. The clinical course of those with adenovirus D keratoconjunctivitis is significantly more severe than those with non-adenovirus D species infections or adenovirus-negative keratoconjunctivitis; high viral load at presentation and non-United States origin of participants is associated with poorer clinical outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) commonly experience aggravation of their symptoms after viral upper respiratory infection (URI). Rhinovirus (RV) is the most common URI-causing virus. However, there is a lack of a mouse model of RV infection and in vivo studies investigating the effect of RV infection on CRS. METHODS: A mouse model of chronic allergic rhinosinusitis (CARS) was established by sensitizing to ovalbumin (OVA) through intraperitoneal injection followed by nasal challenges with OVA for 5 weeks. Both control and CARS mice were euthanized at 48 hours after infection with minor group RV serotype 1B (RV1B). Sinonasal complex samples were evaluated histologically; and interleukin (IL)-6, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$, and interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ were measured in the nasal lavage fluid. The RV1B-infected areas in control and CARS mice were identified using immunofluorescence. RESULTS: In the infected control mice group, RV1B increased secretory hyperplasia in the sinonasal mucosa and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including INF-$\gamma$, MIP-2, and IL-13. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal mucosa from RV1B-infected mice presented abundant RV1B staining, which was distributed between the epithelium and the lamina propria. In the CARS group, the RV1B-infected area per unit was significantly higher than that in control mice. However, RV1B infection neither increased the proinflammatory cytokine secretion nor worsened the histology significantly. CONCLUSION: We successfully established a mouse model of upper airway RV infection by nasal inoculation with RV1B. Although there was histologically-proven increased RV infection in the CARS model, the infection did not intensify sinonasal inflammation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) can be aggravated by viral upper respiratory infections. We aimed to investigate whether any specific human rhinovirus (HRV) serotype is more common in the mucosa of CRS patients, and to find any defining clinical characteristics, according to the various HRV serotypes. METHODS: A prospective case-control study was conducted to determine HRV serotypes in 111 CRS patients and 51 non-CRS controls. No participant had a history of upper respiratory infection over a 4-week period. Nasal lavage fluids and turbinate epithelial cells were collected prospectively. When HRV was detected with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), strains were further characterized by sequencing the VP4/VP2 region of the HRV genome. RESULTS: HRV was detected in 40 CRS subjects (36{\%}) and 11 non-CRS controls (21{\%}). The overall detection rates of HRV in CRS patients were higher than in non-CRS controls (p {\textless} 0.05). Of the 8 serotypes detected in CRS patients, 5 belonged to HRV-A and 3 belonged to HRV-B; HRV-C was not detected. In non-CRS controls, only HRV-A was identified, with only 2 serotypes detected (HRV-A13 and HRV-A16). HRV-B and C were not detected. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of HRV in CRS patients was confirmed in our study. However, we were unable to determine whether certain HRV serotypes are more predominant in CRS patients than non-CRS controls. HRV-A13 was the most common serotype in both CRS patients and non-CRS controls. We could not find any differences in the clinical characteristics according to the HRV serotypes in CRS patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is recognised as aetiological factor of carcinogenesis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPC). HPV-related OPC respond better to treatments and have a significantly favourable outcome. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) implicated in tumour invasion, is a hallmark of a poor prognosis in carcinomas. METHODS: We have studied the relationship of EMT markers (E-cadherin, $\beta$-catenin and vimentin) with HPV infection (DNA and E6/E7 mRNA detection), p16(INK4a) expression and survival outcomes in a cohort of 296 patients with OPC. RESULTS: Among the 296 OPSSC, 26{\%} were HPV positive, 20.3{\%} had overt EMT ({\textgreater}25{\%} of vimentin positive tumour cells). Lower E-cadherin expression was associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis in univariate (P=0.0110) and multivariate analyses (hazard ratios (HR)=6.86 (1.98; 23.84)). Vimentin expression tends towards worse metastasis-free survival (MFS; HR=2.53 (1.00; 6.41)) and was an independent prognostic factor of progression-free survival (HR=1.55 (1.03; 2.34)). CONCLUSIONS: There was a non significant association of EMT with HPV status. This may be explained by a mixed subpopulation of patients HPV positive with associated risk factors (HPV, tobacco and alcohol). Thus, the detection of EMT in OPC represents another reliable approach in the prognosis and the management of OPC whatever their HPV status.},

abstract = {Respiratory viruses are a cause of upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), but can be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in immunocompromised patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic variability of influenza virus, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the duration of viral shedding in hematological patients. Nasopharyngeal swabs from hematological patients were screened for influenza, parainfluenza and RSV on admission as well as on development of respiratory symptoms. Consecutive swabs were collected until viral clearance. Out of 672 tested patients, a total of 111 patients (17{\%}) were infected with one of the investigated viral agents: 40 with influenza, 13 with parainfluenza and 64 with RSV; six patients had influenza/RSV or parainfluenza/RSV co-infections. The majority of infected patients (n = 75/111) underwent stem cell transplantation (42 autologous, 48 allogeneic, 15 autologous and allogeneic). LRTI was observed in 48 patients, of whom 15 patients developed severe LRTI, and 13 patients with respiratory tract infection died. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a variety of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), influenza B, parainfluenza 3 and RSV A, B viruses. RSV A was detected in 54 patients, RSV B in ten patients. The newly emerging RSV A genotype ON1 predominated in the study cohort and was found in 48 (75{\%}) of 64 RSV-infected patients. Furthermore, two distinct clusters were detected for RSV A genotype ON1, identical RSV G gene sequences in these patients are consistent with nosocomial transmission. Long-term viral shedding for more than 30 days was significantly associated with prior allogeneic transplantation (p = 0.01) and was most pronounced in patients with RSV infection (n = 16) with a median duration of viral shedding for 80 days (range 35-334 days). Long-term shedding of respiratory viruses might be a catalyzer of nosocomial transmission and must be considered for efficient infection control in immunocompromised patients.},

abstract = {The role of nasal and fecal microbiota in viral respiratory infections has not been established. We collected nasal swabs and washes, and fecal samples in a clinical study assessing the effect of probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bl-04 on experimental rhinovirus infection. The nasal and fecal microbiota were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The resulting data were compared with nasal inflammatory marker concentrations, viral load, and clinical symptoms. By using unsupervised clustering, the nasal microbiota divided into six clusters. The clusters predominant of Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium/Alloiococcus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonadaceae/Mixed had characteristic inflammatory marker and viral load profiles in nasal washes. The nasal microbiota clusters of subjects before the infection associated with the severity of clinical cold symptoms during rhinovirus infection. Rhinovirus infection and probiotic intervention did not significantly alter the composition of nasal or fecal microbiota. Our results suggest that nasal microbiota may influence the virus load, host innate immune response, and clinical symptoms during rhinovirus infection, however, further studies are needed.},

He was treated with oral oseltamivir, later combined with intravenous zanamivir. The H275Y neuraminidase (NA) mutation was first detected, and an E119D NA mutation was identified during zanamivir therapy. METHODS: Recombinant wild-type (WT) E119D and E119D/H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 NA variants were generated by reverse genetics. Susceptibility to NA inhibitors (NAIs) was evaluated with a fluorometric assay using the 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-$\alpha$-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate. Susceptibility to favipiravir (T-705) was assessed using plaque reduction assays. The NA affinity and velocity values were determined with NA enzymatic studies. RESULTS: We identified an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 E119D mutant that exhibited a marked increase in the 50{\%} inhibitory concentrations against all tested NAIs (827-, 25-, 286-, and 702-fold for zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir, respectively). The double E119D/H275Y mutation further increased oseltamivir and peramivir 50{\%} inhibitory concentrations by 790- and {\textgreater}5000-fold, respectively, compared with the WT. The mutant viruses remained susceptible to favipiravir. The NA affinity and velocity values of the E119D variant decreased by 8.1-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively, compared with the WT. CONCLUSIONS: The actual emergence of a single NA mutation conferring pan-NAI resistance in the clinical setting reinforces the pressing need to develop new anti-influenza strategies.},

abstract = {Recombinant type 5 adenovirus (rAd5) vaccines hold the promise to prevent HIV-1 infections. Intranasal vaccination not only stimulates systemic immunity but also elicits mucosal immunity that provides first defense for mucosally transmitted diseases like HIV-1. Adjuvants such as TLR agonists are usually codelivered with antigens to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines. Here, we present a rAd5 vaccine delivery system using DEG-PEI as the carrier. Adenovirus encoding HIV gag was used as antigen, and was complexed with DEG-PEI polymer via electrostatic interaction. A novel synthetic TLR-4 agonist, RS09, was either chemically linked with DEG-PEI (DP-RS09) or physically mixed with it(DP/RS09) to enhance the immunogenticity of rAd5 vaccine. After intranasal immunization, the systemic antigen-specific immune responses and cytotoxicity T lymphocytes responses induced by DP-RS09-rAd5 and DP/RS09-rAd5 were analyzed. The mucosal secretory IgA level was detected in both nasal and vaginal washes to determine the mucosal immunity. Furthermore, cytokine productions on RAW264.7 cells were tested after preincubation with TLR-4 pathway inhibitors. The results indicated that DEG-PEI could facilitate the intranasal delivery of rAd5 vaccine. Both chemically linked (DP-RS09) and physically mixed RS09 (DP/RS09) could further enhance the mucosal immunity of rAd5 vaccine via TLR-4 pathway. This RS09 adjuvanted DEG-PEI polymer represents a potential intranasal vaccine delivery system and may have a wider application for other viral vectors.},

abstract = {Facing the threat of highly variable virus infection, versatile vaccination systems are urgently needed. Intranasal mRNA vaccination provides a flexible and convenient approach. However, the nasal epithelium remains a major biological barrier to deliver antigens to nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). To address this issue, a potent polymer-based intranasal mRNA vaccination system for HIV-1 treatment was synthesized using cationic cyclodextrin-polyethylenimine 2k conjugate (CP 2k) complexed with anionic mRNA encoding HIV gp120. The delivery vehicle containing CP 2k and mRNA overcame the epithelial barrier by reversibly opening the tight junctions, enhanced the paracellular delivery of mRNA and consequently minimized absorption of toxins in the nasal cavity. Together with the excellent intracellular delivery and prolonged nasal residence time, strong system and mucosal anti-HIV immune responses as well as cytokine productions were achieved with a balanced Th1/Th2/Th17 type. Our study provided the first proof of evidence that cationic polymers can be used as safe and potent intranasal mRNA vaccine carriers to overcome the nasal epithelial barrier. The safe and versatile polymeric delivery system represents a promising vaccination platform for infectious diseases.},

METHODS: BALB/c mice were subjected to an established model of allergic airway disease. AdIL-35 was administered intranasally and the effect of IL-35 on Th2 responses, pulmonary inflammation, goblet cell metaplasia, and AHR were assessed. RESULTS: Transfer of AdIL-35 significantly reduced the severity of AHR and numbers of inflammatory cells and levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, compared with administration of a control virus. Moreover, AdIL-35 elevated the numbers of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the lungs. Histological analysis showed that AdIL-35 inhibited allergic lung tissue inflammation and mucus hypersecretion. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated delivery of interleukin-35 gene can mitigate allergic airway inflammation in experimental asthma and suggest that IL-35 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to treat allergic asthma.},

abstract = {Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has catastrophic impacts on the global pig industry. Although the fecal-oral route is generally accepted, an increased number of reports indicate that airborne transmission may contribute to PEDV outbreak. Here, we show that PEDV could cause typical diarrhea in piglets through a nasal spray. Firstly, PEDV can develop a transient nasal epithelium infection. Subsequently, PEDV-carrying dendritic cells (DCs) allow the virus to be transferred to CD3(+) T cells via the virological synapse. Finally, virus-loaded CD3(+) T cells reach the intestine through the blood circulation, leading to intestinal infection via cell-to-cell contact. Our study provides evidence for airborne transmission of a gastrointestinal infected coronavirus and illustrates the mechanism of its transport from the entry site to the pathogenic site.},

METHODS: HPV DNA detection was performed by the fluorescence-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Stathmin protein expression was investigated by the immunohistochemistry method and mRNA expression of stathmin, Kif2a, and cyclin D1 were assessed by real-time PCR in SNIP and control subjects. RESULTS: The positive rate of HPV DNA detected in SNIP was about 53.6{\%} (15 of 28). Recurrent cases showed a higher rate of HPV infection compared with initial cases and higher Krouse stage (T3 + T4) cases showed higher rate of HPV infection than lower Krouse stage (T1 + T2) cases. Stronger expression of stathmin, Kif2a, and cyclin D1 were observed in SNIP, especially HPV(+) SNIP. CONCLUSION: HPV infection was closely associated with recurrence and progression of SNIP. Stathmin is a valuable prognostic marker and could be considered as a therapeutic target in patients with SNIP.},

abstract = {To prevent viral infection at the site of entry, mucosal vaccines are potent tools for inducing IgA secretion for defense. Because Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands serve as strong adjuvants, two ligands that mimic the structure of mycoplasmal and bacterial lipopeptides represent interesting vaccine candidates. Pam3CSK4, a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide, interacts with TLR2/1. Because fibroblast-stimulating lipopeptide-1 (FSL-1), a synthetic diacylated lipopeptide, is recognized by TLR2/6, we targeted the potential immuno-inducibility of Pam3CSK4 and FSL-1 as adjuvants of an enterovirus 71 (EV71) mucosal vaccine. Na{\"{i}}ve BALB/c mice were used for intranasal immunization three times over a 3-week interval, with results showing that EV71-specific IgG and IgA in serum, nasal washes, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and feces from the EV71 + FSL-1 group were significantly higher than levels observed in mice treated with EV71 + Pam3CSK4, EV71 alone, or the control group treated with phosphate-buffered saline. Furthermore, we observed more EV71-specific IgG and IgA-producing cells in treatments using EV71 formulated with FSL-1. Additionally, T cell-proliferative responses and interferon-$\gamma$ and interleukin-17 secretion were significantly increased when inactivated EV71 was formulated using FSL-1. Moreover, serum from immunized mice was capable of neutralizing the infectivity of EV71 (C2 genotype) and was able to cross-neutralize the B4 and B5 genotypes of EV71. Our data suggested that FSL-1 could be used as an efficient adjuvant for intranasal EV71-vaccine immunization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Influenza Resistance Information Study (IRIS) was initiated in 2008 to study the emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance and the clinical course of influenza in immunocompetent treated and untreated patients. METHODS: Patients had throat/nose swabs collected on days 1, 3, 6 and 10 for analyses of influenza type, subtype and virus susceptibility to NAIs. RT-PCR-positive samples were cultured and tested for NAI resistance by specific RT-PCR and phenotypic testing. Scores for influenza symptoms were recorded on diary cards (Days 1-10). This study focuses on influenza A-infected cases only. RESULTS: Among 3230 RT-PCR-positive patients, 2316 had influenza A of whom 1216 received oseltamivir monotherapy within 2 days of symptom onset (9 seasonal H1N1; 662 H3N2; 545 H1N1pdm2009). Except for 9 patients with naturally resistant seasonal H1N1 (2008/9), no resistance was detected in Day 1 samples. Emergence of resistance (post-Day 1) was detected in 43/1207 (3.56{\%}) oseltamivir-treated influenza A-infected patients, with a higher frequency in 1- to 5-year-olds (11.8{\%}) vs {\textgreater}5-year-olds (1.4{\%}). All N1- and N2-resistant viruses had H275Y (n = 27) or R292K (n = 16) substitutions, respectively. For 43 patients, virus clearance was significantly delayed vs treated patients with susceptible viruses (8.1 vs 10.9 days; P {\textless} .0001), and 11 (23.2{\%}) remained RT-PCR positive for influenza at Day 10. However, their symptoms resolved by Day 6 or earlier. CONCLUSIONS: Oseltamivir resistance was only detected during antiviral treatment, with the highest incidence occurring among 1- to 5-year-olds. Resistance delayed viral clearance, but had no impact on symptom resolution.},

abstract = {Inverted papilloma is a rare sinonasal tumor that mainly occurs in adults during the 5th decade. Three characteristics make this tumor very different from other sinonasal tumors: a relatively strong potential for local destruction, high rate of recurrence, and a risk of carcinomatous evolution. Etiology remains little understood, but an association with human papilloma virus has been reported in up to 40{\%} of cases, raising the suspicions of implication in the pathogenesis of inverted papilloma. Treatment of choice is surgery, by endonasal endoscopic or external approach, depending on extension and tumoral characteristics. Follow-up is critical, to diagnose local relapse, which is often early but may also be late. The seriousness of this pathology lies in its association with carcinoma, which may be diagnosed at the outset or at recurrence during follow-up. It is important to diagnose recurrence to enable early treatment, especially in case of associated carcinoma or malignancy. A comprehensive review of the international literature was performed on PubMed and Embase, using the following search-terms: "sinonasal" [All Fields] AND ("papilloma, inverted" [MeSH Terms] OR ("papilloma" [All Fields] AND "inverted" [All Fields]) OR "inverted papilloma" [All Fields] OR ("inverted" [All Fields] AND "papilloma" [All Fields])). We reviewed all articles referring to sinonasal inverted papilloma published up to January 2015. The present article updates the state of knowledge regarding sinonasal inverted papilloma.},

To explore the virus characteristics, mice, chickens and pigs were selected for pathogenicity study. Pigs inoculated intranasally with 10(6) TCID50 SH07 showed clinical symptoms with coughing and sneezing, but no death. The virus nuclear acid was detected in many tissues using real-time PCR, which was mainly distributed in respiratory system particularly in the lungs. The virus was low-pathogenic to chickens with 10(6) TCID50 dose inoculation either via intramuscular or intranasal routes. However virus nuclear acid detection and virus isolation confirmed that the virus can also be found in nasal and rectum. When virus was inoculated into mice by intramuscular or intranasal routes we observed 100{\%} and 80{\%} lethality respectively. The third generation of samples passaged on MDCK cell were SIV positive in indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using antiserum against H1N2 SIV. Furthermore, the lungs of mice showed obvious lesion with interstitial pneumonia. Data in our study suggest that SH07 is preferentially pathogenic to mammals rather than birds although it is a reasserting virus with the fragments from swine, human and avian origin.},

abstract = {To identify circulating emerging/reemerging viral strains and epidemiological trends, an influenza sentinel surveillance network was established in Shandong Province, China, in 2005. Nasal and/or throat swabs from patients with influenza-like-illness were collected at sentinel hospitals. Influenza viruses were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or virus isolation. From October 2005 to March 2012, 7763 (21.44 {\%}) of 36,209 swab samples were positive for influenza viruses, including 5221 (67.25 {\%}) influenza A and 2542 (32.75 {\%}) influenza B. While the influenza viruses were detected year-round, their type/subtype distribution varied significantly. Peak influenza activity was observed from November to February. The proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was highest among participants aged 0-4 years (14.97 {\%}) in the 2005-2009 and 2010-2012 influenza seasons and the positivity rate of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was highest in the 15 to 24 year age group during the 2009-2010 influenza season. Genetic analysis of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes revealed that the viruses matched seasonal influenza vaccine strains in general, with some amino acid mutations. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains isolated in Shandong Province were characterized by an S203T mutation that is specific to clade 7 isolates. This report illustrates that the Shandong Provincial influenza surveillance system was sensitive in detecting influenza virus variability by season and by genetic composition. This system will help official public health target interventions such as education programs and vaccines.},

abstract = {Nasal and sinonasal inverted papilloma (NSIP) is a benign tumor in which surface epithelial cells grow downward into the underlying supportive tissue with varying degrees of metaplasia. Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been proposed as the causal agent in the pathogenesis of this disease. Many studies have shown that HPV can activate the Akt/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, but the role of this pathway in HPV-associated NSIP is largely unknown. In this study, we enrolled 40 control tissue samples and 80 NSIP tissue samples. HPV genotyping showed that 47 of the 80 examined cases of NSIP were HPV-positive (58.8{\%}), and the most common subtype was HPV11 (20/53, 37.7{\%}). The immunohistochemistry showed statistically significant differences in phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein staining among control samples, HPV-positive NSIP and HPV-negative NSIP. The HPV11 L1-L2 plasmid increased the proliferation of normal human nasopharyngeal epithelial NP69-SV40T cells and human nasopharyngeal cancer CNE1 cells. Meanwhile, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, reversed the increased cell proliferation induced by the HPV11 L1-L2 plasmid. Western blot analysis showed that Akt/mTOR/S6 were overexpressed in NP69-SV40T cells and CNE1 cells infected with the HPV11 L1-L2 plasmid. These data demonstrate that HPV promotes cell proliferation through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in NSIP.},

abstract = {AIMS: Extramedullary plasmacytomas are often localized, clinically indolent neoplasms, and affected patients usually respond to radiation therapy or limited cycles of chemotherapy. In contrast, plasmablastic lymphomas are clinically aggressive neoplasms composed of immunoblastic or plasmablastic cells and associated with more mature plasma cells in some cases. Patients with plasmablastic lymphoma usually have a poor prognosis despite aggressive chemotherapy. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is uncommon in plasmacytoma, but common in plasmablastic lymphoma, and is therefore helpful in differential diagnosis. The aim of this study is to describe four cases of plasmacytoma arising in immunocompetent individuals that were diffusely positive for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA as shown by in-situ hybridization. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the clinicopathological and immunophenotypic findings of four EBV-positive plasmacytomas arising in immunocompetent patients. These tumours were characterized by diffuse proliferation of mature-appearing plasma cells intermixed with a briskly reactive, CD8-positive, TIA-1-positive cytotoxic T-cell infiltrate. Long-term follow-up was available for all patients, and all were alive and free of disease at last follow-up (median 43.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest the term EBV-positive plasmacytoma in immunocompetent patients for these lesions. It is essential to distinguish these tumours from plasmablastic lymphoma, as the latter diagnosis is associated with a much poorer prognosis, and patients require much more aggressive therapy.},

abstract = {BST-2 (tetherin, CD317, HM1.24) restricts virus growth by tethering enveloped viruses to the cell surface. The role of BST-2 during influenza A virus infection (IAV) is controversial. Here, we assessed the capacity of endogenous BST-2 to restrict IAV in primary murine cells. IAV infection increased BST-2 surface expression by primary macrophages, but not alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). BST-2-deficient AEC and macrophages displayed no difference in susceptibility to IAV infection relative to wild type cells. Furthermore, BST-2 played little role in infectious IAV release from either AEC or macrophages. To examine BST-2 during IAV infection in vivo, we infected BST-2-deficient mice. No difference in weight loss or in viral loads in the lungs and/or nasal tissues were detected between BST-2-deficient and wild type animals. This study rules out a major role for endogenous BST-2 in modulating IAV in the mouse model of infection.},

abstract = {Apoptosis and programmed necrosis (necroptosis) determine cell fate, and antagonize infection. Execution of these complementary death pathways involves the formation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) containing complexes. RIPK1 binds to adaptor proteins, such as TRIF (Toll-IL-1 receptor-domain-containing-adaptor-inducing interferon-beta factor), FADD (Fas-associated-protein with death domain), NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B regulatory subunit IKK$\gamma$), SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1/p62), or RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 3), which are involved in RNA sensing, NF-$\kappa$B signaling, autophagosome formation, apoptosis, and necroptosis. We report that a range of rhinoviruses impair apoptosis and necroptosis in epithelial cells late in infection. Unlike the double-strand (ds) RNA mimetic poly I:C (polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid), the exposure of dsRNA to toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in rhinovirus-infected cells did not lead to apoptosis execution. Accordingly, necroptosis and the production of ROS (reactive oxygen species) were not observed late in infection, when RIPK3 was absent. Instead, a virus-induced alternative necrotic cell death pathway proceeded, which led to membrane rupture, indicated by propidium iodide staining. The impairment of dsRNA-induced apoptosis late in infection was controlled by the viral 3C-protease (3Cpro), which disrupted RIPK1-TRIF/FADD /SQSTM1 immune-complexes. 3Cpro and 3C precursors were found to coimmuno-precipitate with RIPK1, cleaving the RIPK1 death-domain, and generating N-terminal RIPK1 fragments. The depletion of RIPK1 or chemical inhibition of its kinase at the N-terminus did not interfere with virus progeny formation or cell fate. The data show that rhinoviruses suppress apoptosis and necroptosis, and release progeny by an alternative cell death pathway, which is controlled by viral proteases modifying innate immune complexes.},

abstract = {Background: We established an in vitro co-culture model involving H3N2-infection of human nasal epithelium with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to investigate their cross-talk during early H3N2 infection. Methods: Nasal epithelium was differentiated from human nasal epithelial stem/progenitor cells and cultured wtih fresh human PBMC. PBMC and supernatants were harvested after 24 and 48 h of co-culture with H3N2-infected nasal epithelium. We used flow cytometry and Luminex to characterize PBMC subpopulations, their activation and secretion of cytokine and chemokines. Results: H3N2 infection of the nasal epithelium associated with significant increase in interferons (IFN-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-29), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-$\alpha$, BDNF, IL-3) and viral-associated chemokines (IP-10, MCP-3, I-TAC, MIG), detectable already after 24 h. This translates into rapid activation of monocytes, NK-cells and innate T-cells (MAIT and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells), evident with CD38+ and/or CD69+ upregulation. Conclusions: This system may contribute to in vitro mechanistic immunological studies bridging systemic models and possibly enable the development of targeted immunomodulatory therapies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophils in the nasal mucosa are an elemental feature of allergic rhinitis. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to explore eosinophilic inflammation and its impact on respiratory virus infection at the nasal mucosa. METHODS: Inflammation in the nasal mucosae of mice was evaluated in response to repetitive stimulation with strict intranasal volumes of a filtrate of Alternaria alternata. Mice were then challenged with influenza virus. RESULTS: Repetitive stimulation with A. alternata resulted in eosinophil recruitment to the nasal passages in association with elevated levels of IL-5, IL-13 and eotaxin-1; eosinophil recruitment was diminished in eotaxin-1(-/-) mice, and abolished in Rag1(-/-) mice. A. alternata also resulted in elevated levels of nasal wash IgA in both wild-type and eosinophil-deficient ∆dblGATA mice. Interestingly, A. alternata-treated mice responded to an influenza virus infection with profound weight loss and mortality compared to mice that received diluent alone (0{\%} vs 100{\%} survival, ***P {\textless} .001); the lethal response was blunted when A. alternata was heat-inactivated. Minimal differences in virus titre were detected, and eosinophils present in the nasal passages at the time of virus inoculation provided no protection against the lethal sequelae. Interestingly, nasal wash fluids from mice treated with A. alternata included more neutrophils and higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to virus challenge, among these, IL-6, a biomarker for disease severity in human influenza. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Repetitive administration of A. alternata resulted in inflammation of the nasal mucosae and unanticipated morbidity and mortality in response to subsequent challenge with influenza virus. Interestingly, and in contrast to findings in the lower airways, eosinophils recruited to the nasal passages provided no protection against lethal infection. As increased susceptibility to influenza virus among individuals with rhinitis has been the subject of several clinical reports, this model may be used for further exploration of these observations.},

abstract = {The present study was designed to construct a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) which can express NAP in the brain and examine whether this virus can produce antidepressant effects on C57 BL/6 mice that had been subjected to open field test and forced swimming test, via nose-to-brain pathway. When the recombinant plasmid pGEM-T Easy/NT4-NAP was digested by EcoRI, 297 bp fragments can be obtained and NT4-NAP sequence was consistent with the designed sequence confirmed by DNA sequencing. When the recombinant plasmid pSSCMV/NT4-NAP was digested by EcoRI, 297 bp fragments is visible. Immunohistochemical staining of fibroblasts revealed that expression of NAP was detected in NT4-NAP/AAV group. Intranasal delivery of NT4-NAP/AAV significantly reduced immobility time when the FST was performed after 1 day from the last administration. The effects observed in the FST could not be attributed to non-specific increases in activity since intranasal delivery of NT4-NAP/AAV did not alter the behavior of the mice during the open field test. The results indicated that a recombinant AAV vector which could express NAP in cells was successfully constructed and NAP may be a potential target for therapeutic action of antidepressant treatment.},

abstract = {Depression is a disturbing psychiatric disease with unsatisfied therapy. Not all patients are sensitive to anti-depressants currently in use, side-effects are unavoidable during therapy, and the cases with effectiveness are always accompanied with delayed onset of clinical efficacy. Delivering brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to brain seems to be a promising therapy. However, a better approach to delivery is still rudimentary. The purpose of our present work is to look for a rapid-onset and long-lasting therapeutic strategy for major depressive disorder (MDD) by effectively delivering BDNF to brain. BDNF, fused with cell-penetrating peptides (TAT and HA2), was packaged in adenovirus associated virus (AAV) to construct the BDNF-HA2TAT/AAV for intranasally delivering BDNF to central nervous system (CNS) via nose-brain pathway. Intranasal administration of BDNF-HA2TAT/AAV to normal mice displayed anti-depression effect in forced swimming test when the delivery lasted relatively longer. The AAV applied to mice subjected to chronic mild stress (CMS) through intranasal administration for 10 days also alleviated depression-like behaviors. Western-blotting analysis revealed that BDNF-HA2TAT/AAV nasal administration enhanced hippocampal BDNF content. These results indicate intranasal administration of constructed BDNF-HA2TAT/AAV exerts anti-depression effect in CMS mice by increasing hippocampal BDNF, suggesting that this strategy holds a promising therapeutic potential for MDD.},

Between 1st January and 1st May, 2011 retrospective observational study was conducted in M. Iashvili Children's Central Hospital. From 1028 patients with influenza like illness hospitalized at Children's Hospital 871 specimens were collected and 360 tested positive for influenza: A(H1N1)pdm - 139 and B - 221. Data were obtained for 290 cases: A(H1N1)pdm - 122 and B - 168. At the time of hospital admission, influenza A(H1N1)pdm and B cases had similar median age of 2 years. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days for both influenza types. Predominant clinical symptoms were fever (98.3{\%}), cough (82.4{\%}) and running nose (68.6{\%}). 39.7{\%} (115/290) of patients suffered with lower respiratory tract infection: A(H1N1)pdm - 41{\%} (50/122) and B - 38.7{\%} (65/168). 19{\%} (55/290) developed pneumonia of which 12 with primary diagnosis of acute respiratory failure were admitted to ICU: A(H1N1)pdm - 4.9{\%} (6/122) and B - 3.6{\%} (6/168). Median length in ICU stay was 6 days. Only two patients with A(H1N1)pdm required artificial ventilation with one fatal outcome. Almost equally (31{\%}) patients with influenza A or B viruses suffered with at least one pre-existing condition. Statistically significant association was revealed between neurological pre-existing conditions and developing pneumonia (OR=5.6; p=0.00) and ICU requirement (OR=17.5, p=0.00). Congenital malformations were also associated with sever course of disease (OR=9.1; p=0.01). Treatment with antiviral oseltamivir was prescribed to 29.5{\%} (36/122) A(H1N1)pdm and 8.3{\%} (14/168) B cases among whom only 24{\%} cases received antiviral within 48 hours after symptoms onset. None of the patients was vaccinated against influenza. Our study revealed no significant difference between influenza A(H1N1)pdm and influenza B in terms of age distribution, clinical manifestation, hospital stay or complications in hospitalized children during post pandemic season. Pre-existing conditions such as neurological disorders and congenital malformations represented risk factors for severe course of influenza, therefore timely antiviral treatment and annual influenza vaccination is recommended to avoid complications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacteria and respiratory viruses are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute otitis media (AOM); however, data from low-middle income countries are sparse. We investigated the etiology of AOM in HIV-infected (HIV+), HIV-uninfected (HIV-) and HIV-exposed clinically asymptomatic for HIV-infection (HEU) South African children. METHODS: Children ≥3 months to {\textless}5 years of age with AOM were enrolled between May 2009 and April 2010 (NCT01031082). Middle ear fluid samples were cultured for bacteria; antibacterial susceptibility was done and serotyping undertaken for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed for respiratory viruses using immunofluorescence assay and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of 260 AOM episodes (HIV+:15; HIV-:182; HEU:63), bacteria were found in 54.6{\%}, including Haemophilus influenzae (30.8{\%}), 98.8{\%} of which were nontypeable, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20.4{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8{\%}), Moraxella catarrhalis (5.0{\%}) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.5{\%}). Nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin was 64.2{\%}. Respiratory viruses were detected in 74.2{\%} of cases. Human rhinovirus was most frequently detected (37.7{\%}), followed by adenovirus (14.2{\%}) and human bocavirus (11.5{\%}) overall and irrespective of HIV status. Respiratory viruses were identified concurrently with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (76.9-78.8{\%}) and Staphylococcus aureus (63.4{\%}) cultured from middle ear fluid, as well as in 72.0{\%} of episodes negative for any bacteria. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that respiratory viruses and pathogenic bacteria play an important role in the development of AOM in children. A similar spectrum of pathogens was observed independently of HIV status. Vaccines targeting both nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae may have a broad impact on AOM in South Africa.},

Such studies support a role of resident microbes in both health and disease of host tissue, especially in the case of inflammatory mucosal diseases. Identifying interactive events between microbes and elements of the immune system can help us to uncover the pathogenic mechanisms underlying CRS. Here we provide a review of the findings on the complex upper respiratory microbiome in CRS in comparison with healthy controls.

abstract = {There are currently no drugs available for the treatment of enterovirus (EV)-induced acute and chronic diseases such as the common cold, meningitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, and myocarditis with or without consecutive dilated cardiomyopathy. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of pyrazolopyrimidines, a well-tolerated and potent class of novel EV inhibitors. The compounds inhibit the replication of a broad spectrum of EV in vitro with IC50 values between 0.04 and 0.64 $\mu$M for viruses resistant to pleconaril, a known capsid-binding inhibitor, without affecting cytochrome P450 enzyme activity. Using virological and genetics methods, the viral capsid was identified as the target of the most promising, orally bioavailable compound 3-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)amino-6-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-4-amine (OBR-5-340). Its prophylactic as well as therapeutic application was proved for coxsackievirus B3-induced chronic myocarditis in mice. The favorable pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and pharmacodynamics profile in mice renders OBR-5-340 a highly promising drug candidate, and the regulatory nonclinical program is ongoing.},

The aim of these 2 studies was to investigate the safety and efficacy of PrEP-001 prophylaxis against rhinovirus (HRV-A16) and influenza-A (H3N2-IAV). METHODS: Healthy subjects randomly received 2 doses of PrEP-001 or placebo, 48 and 24 h pre-challenge with 10 TCID(50) of HRV-A16 (Study 1) or H3N2-IAV (Study 2). RESULTS: In Study 1, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 38.5 to 4.5 (p = 0.004), median symptom duration from 6.0 to 1.7 days and median mucus production from 15 g to 3 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 3-fold (placebo 73{\%}, PrEP-001 23{\%}, p = 0.002). In Study 2, PrEP-001 reduced median total symptom score from 8.0 to 4.1 (p = 0.021), median symptom duration from 4.6 to 3.7 days and median mucus production from 3.6 g to 1.5 g. The percentage of subjects classified as ill was reduced 2-fold (placebo 48{\%}, PrEP-001 24{\%}, p = 0.064). PrEP-001 reduced peak viral shedding in both studies, as assessed by qRT-PCR of nasal lavage. Seroconversion rates were comparable between placebo and PrEP-001 (Study 1: 77{\%} [both arms]; Study 2: placebo 73{\%}, PrEP-001 80{\%}). PrEP-001 was well-tolerated, with no clinically significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP-001 reduced the number of individuals with clinical illness and attenuated severity and duration of HRV-A16 and H3N2-IAV infections without compromising seroconversion, and was well-tolerated. This supports further evaluation of PrEP-001 as a potential pan-viral prophylaxis for upper respiratory tract infections. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Study 1, HRV-A16 study: EudraCT Number 2012-005579-14 (study conducted before ClinicalTrials.gov registration required). Study 2, H3N2-IAV study: EudraCT Number 2015-002895-26 and ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03220048.},

abstract = {Respiratory influenza virus infections represent a serious threat to human health. Underlying medical conditions and genetic make-up predispose some influenza patients to more severe forms of disease. To date, only a few studies have been performed in patients to correlate a selected group of cytokines and chemokines with influenza infection. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of a novel multiplex micro-proteomics technology, SOMAscan, to quantify proteins in the respiratory mucosa of influenza A and B infected individuals. The analysis included but was not limited to quantification of cytokines and chemokines detected in previous studies. SOMAscan quantified more than 1,000 secreted proteins in small nasal wash volumes from infected and healthy individuals. Our results illustrate the utility of micro-proteomic technology for analysis of proteins in small volumes of respiratory mucosal samples. Furthermore, when we compared nasal wash samples from influenza-infected patients with viral load ≥ 2(8) and increased IL-6 and CXCL10 to healthy controls, we identified 162 differentially-expressed proteins between the two groups. This number greatly exceeds the number of DEPs identified in previous studies in human influenza patients. Most of the identified proteins were associated with the host immune response to infection, and changes in protein levels of 151 of the DEPs were significantly correlated with viral load. Most important, SOMAscan identified differentially expressed proteins heretofore not associated with respiratory influenza infection in humans. Our study is the first report for the use of SOMAscan to screen nasal secretions. It establishes a precedent for micro-proteomic quantification of proteins that reflect ongoing response to respiratory infection.},

No vaccine or antiviral agents are available for the prevention or treatment of HRV infection. Resveratrol exerts antiviral effect against different DNA and RNA viruses. The antiviral effect of a new resveratrol formulation containing carboxymethylated glucan was analyzed in H1HeLa cell monolayers and ex vivo nasal epithelia infected with HRV-16. Virus yield was evaluated by plaque assay and expression of viral capsid proteins by Western blot. IL-10, IFN-$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES levels were evaluated by ELISA assay. ICAM-1 was assessed by Western blot and immunofluorescence. Resveratrol exerted a high, dose-dependent, antiviral activity against HRV-16 replication and reduced virus-induced secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and RANTES to levels similar to that of uninfected nasal epithelia. Basal levels of IL-6 and RANTES were also significantly reduced in uninfected epithelia confirming an anti-inflammatory effect of the compound. HRV-induced expression of ICAM-1 was reversed by resveratrol. Resveratrol may be useful for a therapeutic approach to reduce HRV replication and virus-induced cytokine/chemokine production.},

abstract = {Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is an infectious disease in even-toed ungulates including domestic cattle and wild living ruminants, which repeatedly also occurred in zoological gardens in Europe. The goal of the study presented here was to determine whether wild ruminants--here in the sense of non-domesticated ruminant species in zoological collections--normally not known as carriers of MCF viruses, may carry and shed these viruses and thus might play a possible role as source of infection. To this end, swap samples from eye, nose, and rectum, and also some blood samples, collected from different ruminant species in 11 zoological gardens and animal parks in the years 2007 to 2009 were examined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) for the presence of the genome of viruses known to cause MCF most frequently: alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AIHV-1), ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), caprine herpesvirus 2 (CpHV-2) and malignant catarrhal fever virus--white-tailed deer (MCFV-WTD) The results of this investigation showed the presence of the genomes of one--or more--of these MCF viruses in five of the contributing institutions. A total of 28 samples (12.84{\%}) proved to be positive. In no case, the presence of the AIHV-1 genome was detected. For the first time, the presence of the MCFV-WTD genome was demonstrated in goats, indicating a carrier state of this animal species.},

Major clinical findings are peripheral facial nerve palsy accompanied by ipsilateral ear pain and erythematous vesicular rash on the external ear (herpes zoster oticus) and in the mouth. Thus, diagnosis of RHS is usually clinical. However, auricular herpetic eruption is not always present, making diagnosis more difficult. This report describes a case of RHS with left facial palsy without skin lesions in 60-year-old woman. Multiple ulcers were found on her left soft palate. Polymerase chain reaction analysis on oral mucosa biopsy samples and serologic assays allowed the identification of VZV as the causal agent. Knowledge of the anatomy of the facial nerve is important for oral and maxillofacial surgeons when dealing with patients with RHS, especially in unusual and clinically misleading forms of this syndrome.},

Using a clinical automated platform, we compared the performance of commercially available HPV DNA and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) probes in archival tissues of 57 squamous cell carcinomas. Importantly, a clinical automated platform gives (1) consistent and reproducible results for HPV ISH and (2) better standardization across clinical laboratories. Compared with polymerase chain reaction results, RNA ISH exhibited 93{\%} concordance versus 81{\%} of DNA ISH. RNA ISH was more sensitive than DNA ISH (100{\%} versus 88{\%}) and more specific (87{\%} versus 74{\%}). When only accounting for 2+-3+ positivity, sensitivity was 92{\%} for RNA ISH versus 73{\%} for DNA ISH, highlighting the ease of interpretation. p16 exhibited 96{\%} sensitivity, whereas specificity was only 55{\%}. In 3 cases, both RNA and DNA ISH were positive, whereas polymerase chain reaction results were negative, suggesting that ISH methods might be a more sensitive method. Performing on a clinical automated platform, RNA ISH is sensitive in determining high-risk HPV status in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and has the potential of being a standalone clinical test.},

abstract = {The authors report a case where undifferentiated (classic) penile intraepithelial neoplasia was associated with the presence of goblet cells throughout the full epithelial thickness and which later progressed into an invasive carcinoma. The lesion evolved in three consecutive biopsies from only surface epithelium occupying numerous goblet cells in the first to variably sized solid nodules in the dermis composed of atypical squamous and/or basaloid cells intermixed with numerous goblet cells in the third biopsy. Both cellular components expressed CK7 and p16 protein. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping revealed high risk HPV type 16. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of such a lesion occurring on the penis, which can be considered the penile analogue of cervical stratified mucin-producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE). The correct diagnosis was rendered retrospectively, after recognition of the existence of a vulvar lesion resembling cervical SMILE. The initial biopsy was misinterpreted as extramammary Paget disease, which also constitutes the main pitfall in the differential diagnosis. Another important differential diagnosis is penile/vulvar mucinous metaplasia. The finding of atypical squamous epithelial cells positive for p16 associated with mucinous cells present throughout the full epithelial thickness is a clue to the diagnosis of penile SMILE.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a commensal in the human nasopharynx and the cause of pneumonia, meningitis, sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute otitis media (AOM). AOM is the most common ailment for which antibiotics are prescribed in the United States. With the emergence of new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, finding an effective and broad coverage vaccine to protect against AOM-causing pathogens has become a priority. Mouse models are a cost-effective and efficient way to help determine vaccine efficacy. Here, we describe an NTHi AOM model in C57BL/6J mice, which also utilizes a mouse-adapted H1N1 influenza virus to mimic human coinfection. METHODOLOGY: We tested our coinfection model using a protein vaccine formulation containing protein D, a well-studied NTHi vaccine candidate that can be found in the 10-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugate vaccine. We verified the usefulness of our mouse model by comparing bacterial loads in the nose and ear between protein D-vaccinated and control mice. RESULTS: While there was no measurable difference in nasal bacterial loads, we did detect significant differences in the bacterial loads of ear washes and ear bullae between vaccinated and control mice. CONCLUSION: The results from this study suggest that our NTHi AOM coinfection model is useful for assessing protein vaccines.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory virus infections, including influenza, are an important cause of potentially avoidable hospital admissions in the elderly. Although recent reviews have questioned the efficacy of oseltamivir in the prevention of transmission, it has been a central part of the authors' strategy to manage outbreaks in residential homes. AIM: To evaluate the management of respiratory virus infection outbreaks in residential homes, with particular emphasis on the logistics and effectiveness of antiviral prophylaxis with oseltamivir. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was undertaken from a retrospective survey of records held on a local database for three northern hemisphere influenza seasons from 2010 to 2013. RESULTS: In total, 75 respiratory outbreaks were reported from 590 care homes during the study period; of these, the aetiological agent was confirmed as influenza in 35 outbreaks. Overall attack, hospital admission and death rates for influenza were 29.7{\%}, 5.3{\%} and 3.3{\%}, respectively. A further 10 outbreaks were caused by parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus or respiratory syncytial virus in combination with each other or rhinovirus, and six outbreaks were caused by rhinovirus alone. No agent was identified for the remaining 24 outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Early public health involvement can lead to rapid termination of outbreaks of respiratory virus infections in residential homes. Although the use of oseltamivir is expensive, the data suggest that it does have some benefits as prophylaxis in this setting. Trials are needed to determine the most clinically and cost-effective interventions to control outbreaks in residential homes and avoid hospital admissions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We report the use of reconstituted 3D human airway epithelium cells (HuAECs) of bronchial origin in an air-liquid interface to study respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and to assess the efficacy of RSV inhibitors in (pre-)clinical development. METHODS: HuAECs were infected with RSV-A Long strain (0.01 CCID50/cell, where CCID50 represents 50{\%} cell culture infectious dose in HEp2 cells) on the apical compartment of the culture. At the time of infection or at 1 or 3 days post-infection, selected inhibitors were added and refreshed daily on the basal compartment of the culture. Viral shedding was followed up by apical washes collected daily and quantifying viral RNA by RT-qPCR. RESULTS: RSV-A replicates efficiently in HuAECs and viral RNA is shed for weeks after infection. RSV infection reduces the ciliary beat frequency of the ciliated cells as of 4 days post-infection, with complete ciliary dyskinesia observed by day 10. Treatment with RSV fusion inhibitors resulted in an antiviral effect only when added at the time of infection. In contrast, the use of replication inhibitors (both nucleoside and non-nucleoside) elicited a marked antiviral effect even when the start of treatment was delayed until 1 day or even 3 days after infection. Levels of the inflammation marker RANTES (mRNA) increased ∼200-fold in infected, untreated cultures (at 3 weeks post-infection), but levels were comparable to those of uninfected cultures in the presence of PC786, an RSV replication inhibitor, suggesting that an efficient antiviral treatment might inhibit virus-induced inflammation in this model. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HuAECs offer a robust and physiologically relevant model to study RSV replication and to assess the efficacy of antiviral compounds.},

The latter, such as PCR and real-time PCR, have significant limitations, both quantitative (low capacity), and qualitative (limited number of targets). The article discusses the results of studies on using the microarray method for the identification of viruses (e.g. Orthopoxvirus group, noroviruses, influenza A and B viruses, rhino- and enteroviruses responsible for the FRI (Febrile Respiratory Illness), European bunyaviruses, and SARS-causing viruses), and bacteria (Mycobacterium spp., Yersinia spp., Campylobacter spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Clostridium difficile , Helicobacter pylori), including multiple antibiotic-resistant strains. The method allows for the serotyping and genotyping of bacteria, and is useful in the diagnosis of genetically modified agents. It allows the testing of thousands of genes in one experiment. In addition to diagnosis, it is applicable for gene expression studies, analysis of the function of genes, microorganisms virulence, and allows the detection of even single mutations. The possibility of its operational application in epidemiological surveillance, and in the detection of disease outbreak agents is demonstrated.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Viral agents cause the majority of sore throats. However, there is not currently a score to diagnose viral sore throat. The aims of this study were (i) to find the rate of bacterial and viral causes, (ii) to show the seasonal variations and (iii) to form a new scoring system to diagnose viral sore throat. METHODS: A throat culture for group A beta haemolytic streptococci (GABHS) and a nasopharyngeal swab to detect 16 respiratory viruses were obtained from each patient. Over a period of 52 weeks, a total of 624 throat cultures and polymerase chain reaction analyses were performed. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find the clinical score. RESULTS: Viral infection was found in 277 patients (44.3{\%}), and GABHS infection was found in 116 patients (18.5{\%}). An infectious cause was found in 356 patients (57.1{\%}). Rhinovirus was the most commonly detected infectious agent overall (highest in November, 34.5{\%}), and the highest GABHS rate was in November (32.7{\%}). Analysis of data provided a scoring system, called the Mistik Score, to diagnose viral sore throat. The predictive model for positive viral analysis included the following variables: absence of headache, stuffy nose, sneezing, temperature of ≥37.5°C on physical examination, and the absence of tonsillar exudate and/or swelling. The probability of a positive viral analysis for a score of 5 was 82.1{\%}. CONCLUSION: The Mistik Score may be useful to diagnose viral sore throat. We suggest its use either alone or in combination with the Modified Centor Score.},

abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the most costly disease affecting the cattle industry. The pathogenesis of BRD is complex and includes contributions from microbial pathogens as well as host, environmental and animal management factors. In this study, we utilized viral metagenomic sequencing to explore the virome of nasal swab samples obtained from feedlot cattle with acute BRD and asymptomatic pen-mates at six and four feedlots in Mexico and the USA, respectively, in April-October 2015. Twenty-one viruses were detected, with bovine rhinitis A (52.7 {\%}) and B (23.7 {\%}) virus, and bovine coronavirus (24.7 {\%}) being the most commonly identified. The emerging influenza D virus (IDV) tended to be significantly associated (P=0.134; odds ratio=2.94) with disease, whereas viruses commonly associated with BRD such as bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus were detected less frequently. The detection of IDV was further confirmed using a real-time PCR assay. Nasal swabs from symptomatic animals had significantly more IDV RNA than those collected from healthy animals (P=0.04). In addition to known viruses, new genotypes of bovine rhinitis B virus and enterovirus E were identified and a newly proposed species of bocaparvovirus, Ungulate bocaparvovirus 6, was characterized. Ungulate tetraparvovirus 1 was also detected for the first time in North America to our knowledge. These results illustrate the complexity of the virome associated with BRD and highlight the need for further research into the contribution of other viruses to BRD pathogenesis.},

Studies in Qatar and elsewhere have provided evidence that dromedary camels are a reservoir for the virus, but the exact modes of transmission of MERS-CoV to humans remain unclear. In February 2014, an assessment was made of the suitability and sensitivity of different types of sample for the detection of MERSCoV by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for three gene targets: UpE (upstream of the E gene), the N (nucleocapsid) gene and open reading frame (ORF) 1a. Fifty-three animals presented for slaughter were sampled. A high percentage of the sampled camels (79{\%} [95{\%} confidence interval 66.9-91.5{\%}, standard error 0.0625]; 42 out of 53) were shown to be shedding MERS-CoV at the time of slaughter, yet all the animals were apparently healthy. Among the virus-positive animals, nasal swabs were most often positive (97.6{\%}). Oral swabs were the second most frequently positive (35.7{\%}), followed by rectal swabs (28.5{\%}). In addition, the highest viral load, expressed as a cycle threshold (Ct) value of 11.27, was obtained from a nasal swab. These findings lead to the conclusion that nasal swabs are the candidate sample of choice for detecting MERS-CoV using RT-PCR technology in apparently healthy camels.},

In a few cases, DLE of the lips, scalp, ears or nose may eventually progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Photosensitivity and the long-standing immune-mediated chronic inflammation and dysregulated healing characterized by atrophy, hypopigmentation or scarring inherent to DLE are risk factors for progression to SCC.

abstract = {Sheep and goats are widely infected by oncogenic retroviruses, namely Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus (JSRV) and Enzootic Nasal Tumour Virus (ENTV). Under field conditions, these viruses induce transformation of differentiated epithelial cells in the lungs for Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus or the nasal cavities for Enzootic Nasal Tumour Virus. As in other vertebrates, a family of endogenous retroviruses named endogenous Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus (enJSRV) and closely related to exogenous Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus is present in domestic and wild small ruminants. Interestingly, Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus and Enzootic Nasal Tumour Virus are able to promote cell transformation, leading to cancer through their envelope glycoproteins. In vitro, it has been demonstrated that the envelope is able to deregulate some of the important signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. The role of the retroviral envelope in cell transformation has attracted considerable attention in the past years, but it appears to be highly dependent of the nature and origin of the cells used. Aside from its health impact in animals, it has been reported for many years that the Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus-induced lung cancer is analogous to a rare, peculiar form of lung adenocarcinoma in humans, namely lepidic pulmonary adenocarcinoma. The implication of a retrovirus related to Jaagsiekte Sheep RetroVirus is still controversial and under investigation, but the identification of an infectious agent associated with the development of lepidic pulmonary adenocarcinomas might help us to understand cancer development. This review explores the mechanisms of induction of respiratory cancers in small ruminants and the possible link between retrovirus and lepidic pulmonary adenocarcinomas in humans.},

Between 2010 and 2012, nasal swabs were collected from 1,484 apparently healthy cattle destined for export to the Middle East and Russian Federation. In addition, whole blood samples from 334 animals were tested for antibodies to BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The nasal prevalence of BoCV at the individual animal level was 40.1{\%}. The nasal and seroprevalence of BoHV-1, BRSV, BVDV-1, and BPIV-3 was 1.0{\%} and 39{\%}, 1.2{\%} and 46{\%}, 3.0{\%} and 56{\%}, and 1.4{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively. The nasal prevalence of H. somni, M. bovis, M. haemolytica, and P. multocida was 42{\%}, 4.8{\%}, 13.4{\%}, and 26{\%}, respectively. Significant differences in nasal and seroprevalence were detected between groups of animals from different geographical locations. The results of the current study provide baseline data on the prevalence of organisms associated with BRD in Australian live export cattle in the preassembly period. This data could be used to develop strategies for BRD prevention and control prior to loading.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections. Immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) and children contacts are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. However, the impact of asymptomatic infection in transmission has not been well studied. OBJECTIVES: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV-positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009-2013. RESULTS: RSV infection was detected in 10.1{\%} (70/696) of samples, 4.4{\%} (17/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1{\%} (53/309) from symptomatic patients. (P {\textless} .0001). The VL of symptomatic patients (4.7 log copies/mL) was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic patients (2.3 log copies/mL). RSV detection among asymptomatic caregivers (6.8{\%}; 13/192) was significantly higher compared to other asymptomatic adults, HIV and HCWs (2.0{\%}; 4/195; P = .0252). A close contact with an infected child at home was an important risk to RSV acquisition [OR 22.6 (95{\%} CI 4.8-106.7)]. Children who possibly transmitted the virus to their asymptomatic contacts had significantly higher viral load than children who probably did not transmit (P {\textless} .0001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our results, it is important to know if people circulating inside the hospital have close contact with acute respiratory infected children.},

abstract = {Influenza A viruses are a major health threat to livestock and humans, causing considerable mortality, morbidity, and economic loss. Current inactivated influenza vaccines are strain specific and new vaccines need to be produced at frequent intervals to combat newly arising influenza virus strains, so that a universal vaccine is highly desirable. We show that pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in which the hemagglutinin signal sequence has been suppressed (S-FLU), when administered to pigs by aerosol can induce CD4 and CD8 T cell immune responses in blood, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Neutralizing Ab was not produced. Detection of a BAL response correlated with a reduction in viral titer in nasal swabs and lungs, following challenge with H1N1 pandemic virus. Intratracheal immunization with a higher dose of a heterologous H5N1 S-FLU vaccine induced weaker BAL and stronger tracheobronchial lymph node responses and a lesser reduction in viral titer. We conclude that local cellular immune responses are important for protection against influenza A virus infection, that these can be most efficiently induced by aerosol immunization targeting the lower respiratory tract, and that S-FLU is a promising universal influenza vaccine candidate.},

abstract = {Viral infections of the respiratory tract can be complicated by bacterial superinfection, resulting in a significantly longer duration of illness and even a fatal outcome. In this review, we focused on interactions between S. aureus and non-influenza viruses. Clinical data evidenced that rhinovirus infection may increase the S. aureus carriage load in humans and its spread. In children, respiratory syncytial virus infection is associated with S. aureus carriage. The mechanisms by which some non-influenza respiratory viruses predispose host cells to S. aureus superinfection can be summarized in three categories: i) modifying expression levels of cellular patterns involved in S. aureus adhesion and/or internalization, ii) inducing S. aureus invasion of epithelial cells due to the disruption of tight junctions, and iii) decreasing S. aureus clearance by altering the immune response. The comprehension of pathways involved in S. aureus-respiratory virus interactions may help developing new strategies of preventive and curative therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method it is possible to detect uncultivable viruses and discover multiple viral infections. However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. OBJECTIVES: The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children's hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. RESULTS: Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83{\%}) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31{\%} of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about T cells that respond to human rhinovirus in vivo, due to timing of infection, viral diversity, and complex T-cell specificities. We tracked circulating CD4+ T cells with identical epitope specificities that responded to intranasal challenge with rhinovirus (RV)-A39, and we assessed T-cell signatures in the nose. METHODS: Cells were monitored using a mixture of 2 capsid-specific major histocompatibility complex II tetramers over a 7-week period, before and after RV-A39 challenge, in 16 human leukocyte antigen-DR4+ subjects who participated in a trial of Bifidobacterium lactis (Bl-04) supplementation. RESULTS: Pre-existing tetramer+ T cells were linked to delayed viral shedding, enriched for activated CCR5+ Th1 effectors, and included a minor interleukin-21+ T follicular helper cell subset. After RV challenge, expansion and activation of virus-specific CCR5+ Th1 effectors was restricted to subjects who had a rise in neutralizing antibodies, and tetramer-negative CCR5+ effector memory types were comodulated. In the nose, CXCR3-CCR5+ T cells present during acute infection were activated effector memory type, whereas CXCR3+ cells were central memory type, and cognate chemokine ligands were elevated over baseline. Probiotic had no T-cell effects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that virus-specific CCR5+ effector memory CD4+ T cells primed by previous exposure to related viruses contribute to the control of rhinovirus.},

abstract = {Enhancing antiviral host defense responses through nutritional supplementation would be an attractive strategy in the fight against influenza. Using inoculation with live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) as an infection model, we have recently shown that ingestion of sulforaphane-containing broccoli sprout homogenates (BSH) reduces markers of viral load in the nose. To investigate the systemic effects of short-term BSH supplementation in the context of LAIV-inoculation, we examined peripheral blood immune cell populations in non-smoking subjects from this study, with a particular focus on NK cells. We carried out a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study measuring the effects of BSH (N = 13) or placebo (alfalfa sprout homogenate, ASH; N = 16) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses to a standard nasal vaccine dose of LAIV in healthy volunteers. Blood was drawn prior to (day-1) and post (day2, day21) LAIV inoculation and analyzed for neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NKT cells, and NK cells. In addition, NK cells were enriched, stimulated, and assessed for surface markers, intracellular markers, and cytotoxic potential by flow cytometry. Overall, LAIV significantly reduced NKT (day2 and day21) and T cell (day2) populations. LAIV decreased NK cell CD56 and CD158b expression, while significantly increasing CD16 expression and cytotoxic potential (on day2). BSH supplementation further increased LAIV-induced granzyme B production (day2) in NK cells compared to ASH and in the BSH group granzyme B levels appeared to be negatively associated with influenza RNA levels in nasal lavage fluid cells. We conclude that nasal influenza infection may induce complex changes in peripheral blood NK cell activation, and that BSH increases virus-induced peripheral blood NK cell granzyme B production, an effect that may be important for enhanced antiviral defense responses.

abstract = {CASE HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS A 15-year-old neutered male domestic short-haired cat was presented due to multiple 0.5-2 cm-diameter crusting plaques in the left preauricular region, over the bridge of nose, and in the right periocular region. The plaques did not appear to cause discomfort. HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS Biopsy samples of four plaques were examined histologically. Three plaques consisted of well-demarcated foci of mild epidermal hyperplasia overlying markedly hyperplastic sebaceous glands. Approximately 60{\%} of the hyperplastic cells contained a large cytoplasmic vacuole that ranged from being clear to containing prominent grey-blue fibrillar material. The fourth plaque was composed solely of epidermal hyperplasia, consistent with previous descriptions of feline viral plaques. MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Papillomavirus DNA was amplified from all four plaques using PCR. A single DNA sequence was amplified from the plaques with sebaceous differentiation. This sequence was identical to the FdPV-MY sequence previously suggested to be from a putative unclassified papillomavirus type. Felis catus papillomavirus type 2 sequences were amplified from the plaque typical of feline viral plaques. Immunohistochemistry to detect p16(CDKN2A) protein (p16) showed marked immunostaining throughout the hyperplastic epidermis and adnexal structures within the plaques with sebaceous differentiation. DIAGNOSIS Multiple feline viral plaques with variable sebaceous differentiation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Feline viral plaques with sebaceous differentiation have not been previously reported in cats. The presence of unique cell changes within these lesions, the detection of an unclassified papillomavirus type, and the p16 immunostaining within these plaques suggest that they may have been caused by the papillomavirus that contains the FdPV-MY sequence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A virus subtypes in non-human hosts have not been characterized in Kenya. We carried out influenza surveillance in selected domestic animals and compared the virus isolates with isolates obtained in humans during the same period. METHODS: We collected nasal swabs from pigs, dogs and cats; oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from poultry; and blood samples from all animals between 2010 and 2012. A standardized questionnaire was administered to farmers and traders. Swabs were tested for influenza A by rtRT-PCR, virus isolation and subtyping was done on all positive swabs. All sera were screened for influenza A antibodies by ELISA, and positives were evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). Full genome sequencing was done on four selected pig virus isolates. RESULTS: Among 3,798 sera tested by ELISA, influenza A seroprevalence was highest in pigs (15.9{\%}; 172/1084), 1.2{\%} (3/258) in ducks, 1.4{\%} (1/72) in cats 0.6{\%} (3/467) in dogs, 0.1{\%} (2/1894) in chicken and 0{\%} in geese and turkeys. HI testing of ELISA-positive pig sera showed that 71.5{\%} had positive titers to A/California/04/2009(H1N1). Among 6,289 swabs tested by rRT-PCR, influenza A prevalence was highest in ducks [1.2{\%}; 5/423] and 0{\%} in cats and turkeys. Eight virus isolates were obtained from pig nasal swabs collected in 2011 and were determined to be A(H1N1)pdm09 on subtyping. On phylogenetic analysis, four hemagglutinin segments from pig isolates clustered together and were closely associated with human influenza viruses that circulated in Kenya in 2011. CONCLUSION: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 isolated in pigs was genetically similar to contemporary human pandemic influenza virus isolates. This suggest that the virus was likely transmitted from humans to pigs, became established and circulated in Kenyan pig populations during the study period. Minimal influenza A prevalence was observed in the other animals studied.},

abstract = {The bovine paranasal sinuses are a group of complex cavernous air-filled spaces, lined by respiratory epithelium, the exact function of which is unclear. While lesions affecting these sinuses are occasionally reported in cattle, their microbial flora has not been defined. Furthermore, given that the various bacterial and viral pathogens causing bovine respiratory disease (BRD) persist within herds, we speculated that the paranasal sinuses may serve as a refuge for such infectious agents. The paranasal sinuses of clinically normal cattle (n = 99) and of cattle submitted for post-mortem examination (PME: n = 34) were examined by microbial culture, PCR and serology to include bacterial and viral pathogens typically associated with BRD: Mycoplasma bovis, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPIV-3). Overall, the paranasal sinuses were either predominantly sterile or did not contain detectable microbes (83.5{\%}: 94.9{\%} of clinically normal and 50.0{\%} of cattle submitted for PME). Bacteria, including BRD causing pathogens, were identified in relatively small numbers of cattle ({\textless}10{\%}). While serology indicated widespread exposure of both clinically normal and cattle submitted for PME to BPIV-3 and BRSV (seroprevalences of 91.6{\%} and 84.7{\%}, respectively), PCR identified BPIV-3 in only one animal. To further explore these findings we investigated the potential role of the antimicrobial molecule nitric oxide (NO) within paranasal sinus epithelium using immunohistochemistry. Expression of the enzyme responsible for NO synthesis, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), was detected to varying degrees in 76.5{\%} of a sub-sample of animals suggesting production of this compound plays a similar protective role in the bovine sinus as it does in humans.},

abstract = {Coronaviruses are of major importance for both animal and human health. With the emergence of novel coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, the need for fast genome characterisation is ever so important. Further, in order to understand the influence of quasispecies of these viruses in relation to biology, techniques for deep-sequence and full-length viral genome analysis are needed. In the present study, we compared the efficiency of two sequence-independent approaches [sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA, represented by the Ovation kit)] coupled with high-throughput sequencing to generate the full-length genome of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) from a nasal swab. Both methods achieved high genome coverage (100{\%} for SPIA and 99{\%} for SISPA), however, there was a clear difference in the percentage of reads that mapped to BCoV. While approximately 45{\%} of the Ovation reads mapped to BCoV (sequence depth of 169-284 944), only 0.07{\%} of the SISPA reads (sequence depth of 0-249) mapped to the reference genome. Although BCoV was the focus of the study we also identified a bovine rhinitis B virus (BRBV) in the data sets. The trend for this virus was similar to that observed for BCoV regarding Ovation vs. SISPA, but with fewer sequences mapping to BRBV due to a lower amount of this virus. In summary, the SPIA approach used in this study produced coverage of the entire BCoV (high copy number) and BRBV (low copy number) and a high sequence/genome depth compared to SISPA. Although this is a limited study, the results indicate that the Ovation method could be a preferred approach for full genome sequencing if a low copy number of viral RNA is expected and if high sequence depth is desired.},

abstract = {Surveillance of healthy individuals at high risk for zoonotic influenza A transmission is important for tracking trends in influenza A epidemiology. Practical measurement methods that maximize viral recovery and produce low variability are essential when low viral loads are expected. For this study, lysing both a nasal swab and its storage medium was compared to lysing the storage medium alone to determine which method results in greater influenza A virus recovery. Independent results from two laboratories suggest that including the swab in the lysis step does not lead to higher influenza A virus recovery, and that recovery is less variable when only the swab storage medium is extracted. These results indicate that simply lysing the swab storage medium is an effective extraction method for nasal swabs collected during studies of influenza A virus exposure among healthy populations.},

abstract = {Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but more lethal cutaneous cancer than melanoma. However, spontaneous regression of a number of MCC has been reported, although the cause of this regression remains unclear. In most cases, MCC regresses after a surgical procedure, for example, biopsy. Herein, we report a case of Merkel cell polyomavirus-negative MCC coincident with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that underwent true spontaneous regression without biopsy. One month after the patient's first visit, clinical examination revealed that the tumor had not grown, but its surface showed changes in texture and color. Histopathologically, the excised specimen was indicative of MCC coincident with SCC and showed extensive necrosis in the upper portion of the tumor, numerous caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells, an accumulation of CD68-positive foam cells and vascular invasion. These findings suggested that the tumor had regressed. We hypothesize that extensive coagulative necrosis resulting from an insufficient local blood supply triggered the shedding of some products or components of MCC and SCC, which in turn induced antitumor immunity against both lesions.},

abstract = {Pigs play a significant role during outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) due to their ability to amplify the virus. It is therefore essential to determine what role vaccination could play to prevent clinical disease and lower virus excretion into the environment. In this study we investigated the efficacy of the double oil emulsion A Malaysia 97 vaccine ({\textgreater}6PD50/dose) against heterologous challenge with an isolate belonging to the A SEA-97 lineage at 4 and 7 days post vaccination (dpv). In addition, we determined whether physical separation of pigs in the same room could prevent virus transmission. Statistically there was no difference in the level of protection offered by 4 and 7 dpv. However, no clinical disease or viral RNA was detected in the blood of pigs challenged 4 dpv, although three of the pigs had antibodies to the non-structural proteins (NSPs), indicating viral replication. Viral RNA was also detected in nasal and saliva swabs, but on very few occasions. Two of the pigs vaccinated seven days prior to challenge had vesicles distal from the injection site, but on the inoculated foot, and two pigs had viral RNA detected in the blood. One pig sero-converted to the NSPs. In contrast, all unvaccinated and inoculated pigs had evidence of infection. No infection occurred in any of the susceptible pigs in the same room, but separated from the infected pigs, indicating that strict biosecurity measures were sufficient under these experimental conditions to prevent virus transmission. However, viral RNA was detected in the nasal swabs of one group of pigs, but apparently not at sufficient levels to cause clinical disease. Vaccination led to a significant decrease in viral RNA in vaccinated pigs compared to unvaccinated and infected pigs, even with this heterologous challenge, and could therefore be considered as a control option during outbreaks.},

abstract = {The efficacy and detrimental effect of mucosal vaccination with an inactivated influenza vaccine were examined in a macaque model by intranasal administration with small amounts of inactivated whole virus particles and challenge by a human-derived H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection. Repeated nasal inoculation with the whole particle vaccine of an inactivated virus, A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/2007 (H5N1) (Vac-3), induced antigen-specific IgA and IgG antibody production in nasal swabs and plasma. Vac-3-specific IgE production was also found in the nasal swabs. Nasal vaccination with Vac-3 induced broader cross-clade neutralization activity than did subcutaneous vaccination. After challenge infection, repeated nasal vaccination almost completely prevented the propagation of virus in the upper and lower airways and protected cynomolgus macaques from viral pneumonia by induction of IgA-producing B cells in the lungs. On the other hand, eosinophil clusters were observed in the lungs of vaccinated macaques. Although Vac-3-specific IgE antibody and IL-13 levels were decreased after infection compared to those before infection and no anaphylaxis in vaccinated macaques was detected after challenge infection, our results suggest that we have to pay attention to potential allergic responses at repeated nasal vaccination, especially in people who have an airway allergy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: About half of the world's population are living in the endemic area of dengue viruses implying that a rapid-mass vaccination may be required. In addition, a major target of dengue vaccine are children, thus, a needle-free administration is more attractive. These problems may be overcome by the alternative route of vaccination such as topical, oral and intranasal vaccination. Here, we investigated the possibility to deliver a dengue immunogen intranasally, a painless route of vaccination. The tested immunogen was the domain III of dengue serotype-3 E protein (EDIII-D3) loaded into trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (EDIII-D3 TMC NPs). The primary human nasal epithelial cells, HNEpCs, were used as an in vitro model for nasal responses. RESULTS: At tested concentrations, EDIII-D3 TMC NPs not only exerted no detectable toxicity toward HNEpC cultures but also efficiently delivered EDIII-D3 immunogens into HNEpCs. Moreover, HNEpCs quickly and strongly produced proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$), type-I IFN, the growth factors (GM-CSF, IL-7), the chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1$\beta$, IL-8), Th1-related cytokines (IL-2, IL-12p70, IL-17, IFN-$\gamma$) and Th2-related cytokine (IL-4) in response to EDIII-D3 TMC NPs treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A potential mucosal delivery system for dengue immunogens was revealed and found to stimulate a strong local innate antiviral response which possibly leading to a systemic adaptive immunity.},

abstract = {AIM: To investigate whether the rise during the past decades in the incidence of tonsillar and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC and BOTSCC) and the proportion of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive cancer has continued in Stockholm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment biopsies (n=252) available from 280 patients diagnosed with TSCC and BOTSCC during 2008-2012 in the County of Stockholm were tested for HPV DNA by a multiplex bead-based assay. Incidence records were acquired from the Swedish Cancer Registry. The data obtained were evaluated together with previous figures from 1970 to 2007. RESULTS: HPV DNA was present in 186/252 (74{\%}) of TSCC and BOTSCC biopsies obtained during 2008-2012 in Stockholm. In this region the age-standardised incidence, including the prevalence of HPV-positive and HPV-negative TSCC stabilised 2007-2012 compared to 2000-2006, while for BOTSCC throughout 1998-2012 the same parameters increased moderately (p{\textless}0.05, for all). In parallel, from 2000 to 2006 through 2007-2012 in Sweden, the age-standardised incidence of both TSCC and BOTSCC continued to rise (p=0.012 and p=0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: During 2000-2012 the age-standardised incidence and the proportion of HPV-positive TSCC have stabilised at a high level, while the proportion of HPV-negative cancer has remained at a low level in Stockholm, whereas for BOTSCC all parameters are increasing moderately. In contrast, in Sweden the incidence of both TSCC and BOTSCC is still increasing. We hypothesise that the HPV epidemic could be stabilising, first for TSCC, but so far not for BOTSCC, in e.g. some urban areas, while previous trends for both tumours persist at other geographic locations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated the performance of the Becton Dickinson Veritor™ System Flu A + B rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) to detect influenza viruses in respiratory specimens from patients enrolled at five surveillance sites in Kenya, a tropical country where influenza seasonality is variable. METHODS: Nasal swab (NS) and nasopharyngeal (NP)/oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from patients with influenza like illness and/or severe acute respiratory infection. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the RIDT using NS specimens were evaluated against nasal swabs tested by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The performance parameter results were expressed as 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) calculated using binomial exact methods, with P {\textless} 0.05 considered significant. Two-sample Z tests were used to test for differences in sample proportions. Analysis was performed using SAS software version 9.3. RESULTS: From July 2013 to July 2014, 3,569 patients were recruited, of which 78.7{\%} were aged {\textless}5 years. Overall, 14.4{\%} of NS specimens were influenza-positive by RIDT. RIDT overall sensitivity was 77.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 72.8-81.0{\%}) and specificity was 94.9{\%} (95{\%} CI 94.0-95.7{\%}) compared to rRT-PCR using NS specimens. RIDT sensitivity for influenza A virus compared to rRT-PCR using NS specimens was 71.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 66.7-76.4{\%}) and was significantly higher than for influenza B which was 43.8{\%} (95{\%} CI 33.8-54.2{\%}). PPV ranged from 30{\%}-80{\%} depending on background prevalence of influenza. CONCLUSION: Although the variable seasonality of influenza in tropical Africa presents unique challenges, RIDTs may have a role in making influenza surveillance sustainable in more remote areas of Africa, where laboratory capacity is limited.},

abstract = {In 2012, mumps was introduced from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Vojvodina, causing an outbreak with 335 reported cases. The present manuscript analyses the epidemiological and laboratory characteristics of this outbreak, identifies its main causes and suggests potential future preventive measures. Sera of 133 patients were tested for mumps-specific antibodies by ELISA and 15 nose/throat swabs were investigated for mumps virus RNA by RT-PCR. IgG antibodies were found in 127 patients (95.5{\%}). Mumps infection was laboratory-confirmed in 53 patients, including 44 IgM and 9 PCR positive cases. All other 282 cases were classified as epidemiologically-confirmed. More than half of the patients (n = 181, 54{\%}) were 20-29 years old, followed by the 15-19 age bracket (n = 95, 28.4{\%}). Twice as many males as females were affected (67{\%} versus 33{\%}). Disease complications were reported in 13 cases (3.9{\%}), including 9 patients with orchitis and 4 with pancreatitis. According to medical records or anamnestic data, 190 patients (56.7{\%}) were immunized with two doses and 35 (10.4{\%}) with one dose of mumps-containing vaccine. The Serbian sequences corresponded to a minor genotype G variant detected during the 2011/2012 mumps outbreak in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Vaccine failures, the initial one-dose immunization policy and a vaccine shortage between 1999 and 2002 contributed to the outbreak. Additional vaccination opportunities should be offered to young adults during transition periods in their life trajectories.},

Sera and/or nose/throat swabs were collected from 193 patients and tested for measles-specific IgM antibodies by ELISA and viral RNA by RT-PCR, respectively. Epidemiological data were obtained from the surveillance database of the Institute of Public Health of Serbia. Of the 363 cases involved in the outbreak, 113 were laboratory confirmed. More than one third of the patients were hospitalized (n = 130, 35{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) and for 15 (4{\textperiodcentered}1{\%} of the reported outbreak cases) the infection was complicated by pneumonia. Mostly pre-school children aged ⩽4 years (37{\textperiodcentered}8{\%}) and adults aged ⩾30 years (27{\textperiodcentered}3{\%}) were affected. The majority of patients belonged to the Roma population with a preponderance of female cases (57{\textperiodcentered}0{\%}). Nearly 94{\%} of the patients were either unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status. The main outbreak virus was the D4-Hamburg strain. The outbreak in Serbia occurred after several years of very low measles incidence despite a high routine immunization coverage in the general population, suggesting that special efforts to identify and vaccinate susceptible population groups are required even in countries with apparently good disease control.},

abstract = {Replication kinetics and invasion characteristics of equine herpesvirus-1 and -3 (EHV-1/-3) in nasal and vaginal mucosae were compared using explants. The explants were cultured during 96 h with little change in viability. The tissues were inoculated with EHV-1 03P37 (neuropathogenic), 97P70 (abortigenic) and EHV-3 04P57, collected at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post inoculation (pi) and stained for viral antigens. Both EHV-1 and EHV-3 replicated in a plaquewise manner. The plaques were already observed at 24 h pi, their size increased over time and did not directly cross the basement membrane (BM). However, EHV-1 infected the monocytic cells (MC) and hijacked these cells to invade the lamina propria. In contrast, EHV-3 replication was fully restricted to epithelial cells; the virus did not breach the BM via a direct cell-to-cell spread nor used infected MC. EHV-1-induced plaques were larger in nasal mucosa compared to vaginal mucosa. The opposite was found for EHV-3-induced plaques. Both EHV-1 strains replicated with comparable kinetics in nasal mucosa. However, the extent of replication of the abortigenic strain in vaginal mucosa was significantly higher than that of the neuropathogenic strain. Two-to-five-fold lower numbers of EHV-1-infected MC underneath the BM were found in vaginal mucosa than in nasal mucosa. Our study has shown that (i) EHV-1 has developed in evolution a predisposition for respiratory mucosa and EHV-3 for vaginal mucosa, (ii) abortigenic EHV-1 replicates better in vaginal mucosa than neuropathogenic EHV-1 and (iii) EHV-3 demonstrated a strict epithelial tropism whereas EHV-1 in addition hijacked MC to invade the lamina propria.},

abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) is a zoonotic pathogen threatening animal and public health; therefore, detection and monitoring of IAV in animal populations are critical components of a surveillance program. Swine are important hosts of IAV, wherein the virus can undergo rapid evolution. Several methods (i.e., nasal swabs, nasal wipes, and oral fluids) have been used to collect samples from swine for IAV surveillance. We utilized nasal wipes made from cotton gauze and multiple, polyester or mixed polyester fabrics to compare performance in the molecular detection and isolation of IAV. In vitro experiments revealed that no polyester or mixed polyester fabric was superior to cotton gauze for molecular IAV detection; however, 3 polyester or mixed polyester fabrics yielded significantly more viable IAV than cotton. In a field trial, both cotton gauze and the polyester or mixed polyester fabric yielded similar proportions of IAV isolates from swine. The results indicate that cotton gauze remains a practical and useful material for swine nasal wipes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate an appropriate isolation period for dogs infected with canine influenza A H3N2 virus on the basis of the duration of virus shedding. DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 16 dogs, from 3 Chicago area shelters, naturally infected with canine influenza A H3N2 virus. PROCEDURES Medical records of 16 affected dogs were reviewed. Nasal swab specimens from each dog had been tested periodically for a minimum of 15 days following an initial positive real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) assay result for influenza A virus shedding. Amplicons were purified, quantified, and sequenced by the Sanger DNA sequencing technique. Virus isolation and sequence results of canine influenza A H3N2 virus from nasal swab specimens were obtained in conjunction with signalment, description of clinical signs, type of treatment, and outcome. RESULTS Viruses from each dog were identified as canine influenza A H3N2 virus on the basis of DNA sequencing. The interval between first and last positive rRT-PCR assay results ranged from 13 to 24 days, whereas the time interval from first reported clinical signs to last positive assay results ranged from 15 to 26 days. Isolation of canine influenza A H3N2 virus was successful in the late shedding period from nasal swab specimens of 4 dogs at 15 and 20 days after the first positive rRT-PCR assay result and 18 to 20 days after the first clinical signs. Clinical signs resolved for all dogs that remained in the shelters during the testing period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dogs infected with H3N2 virus should be isolated for a period of ≥ 21 days following onset of illness. Even when resolution of clinical signs occurs sooner than 21 days, shedding of H3N2 virus may persist.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of the pandemic A(H1N1) virus has been changing as population immunity continues to co-evolve with the virus. The impact of genetic changes in the virus on human's susceptibility is an outstanding important question in vaccine design. In a community-based study, we aim to (1) determine the genetic characteristics of 2009-2015 pandemic H1N1 viruses, (2) assess antibody response following natural infections and (3) assess the correlation of A/California/07/09 antibody titers to protection in the 2013 and 2015 epidemics. METHODS: In a household transmission study, serum specimens from 253 individuals in Managua, Nicaragua were analyzed. Combined nose and throat swabs were collected to detect RT-PCR confirmed influenza infection and virus sequencing. Hemagglutination inhibition assays were performed and the protective titer for circulating H1N1pdm was determined. RESULTS: Clade 6B pandemic H1N1 viruses predominated in Nicaragua during the 2013 and 2015 seasons. Our household transmission study detected a household secondary attack rate of 17{\%} in 2013 and 33{\%} in 2015. Infected individuals, including vaccinees, showed an apparent antibody response to A/California/07/09. Baseline titers of A/California/07/09 antibodies were found to associate with protection in both seasons. A titer of ≥1:40 correlated to a 44{\%} protection in children, a 29{\%} protection in adults 15-49years old and a 51{\%} protection in adults 50-85years old. CONCLUSION: In 2013 and 2015, antibody titers to A/California/07/09 associated with an infection risk reduction amongst exposed household contacts. This is consistent with a detectable vaccine effectiveness reported in a number of studies. Genetic changes in clade 6B viruses might have led to a reduced immunity in some whereas others might have been less affected. The use of human serologic data is important in virus characterization and if performed in a timely manner, could assist in vaccine strain selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household studies provide opportunities to understand influenza-like-illness (ILI) transmission, but data from (sub)tropical developing countries are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine the viral etiology and epidemiology of ILI in households. STUDY DESIGN: ILI was detected by active case finding amongst a cohort of 263 northern Vietnam households between 2008 and 2013. Health workers collected nose and throat swabs for virus detection by multiplex real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: ILI was detected at least once in 219 (23.7{\%}) of 945 household members. 271 (62.3{\%}) of 435 nose/throat swabs were positive for at least one of the 15 viruses tested. Six viruses predominated amongst positive swabs: Rhinovirus (28{\%}), Influenza virus (17{\%}), Coronavirus (8{\%}), Enterovirus (5{\%}), Respiratory syncytial virus (3{\%}), Metapneumovirus virus (2.5{\%}) and Parainfluenza virus 3 (1.8{\%}). There was no clear seasonality, but 78{\%} of episodes occurred in Winter/Spring for Influenza compared to 32{\%} for Rhinovirus. Participants, on average, suffered 0.49 ILI, and 0.29 virus-positive ILI episodes, with no significant effects of gender, age, or household size. In contrast to US and Australian community studies, the frequency of ILI decreased as the number of household members aged below 5 years increased (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate the need for tailored ILI control strategies, and for better understanding of how local childcare practices and seasonality may influence transmission and the role of children.},

Both pathogens are associated with seasonal disease outbreaks in the pediatric population, and can often be detected simultaneously in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. It has been described that respiratory virus infections may predispose for bacterial superinfections, resulting in severe disease. However, studies on the influence of bacterial colonization of the upper respiratory tract on the pathogenesis of subsequent respiratory virus infections are scarce. Here, we have investigated whether pneumococcal colonization enhances subsequent HRSV infection. We used a newly generated recombinant subgroup B HRSV strain that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein and pneumococcal isolates obtained from healthy children in disease-relevant in vitro and in vivo model systems. Three pneumococcal strains specifically enhanced in vitro HRSV infection of primary well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface, whereas two other strains did not. Since previous studies reported that bacterial neuraminidase enhanced HRSV infection in vitro, we measured pneumococcal neuraminidase activity in these cultures but found no correlation with the observed infection enhancement in our model. Subsequently, a selection of pneumococcal strains was used to induce nasal colonization of cotton rats, the best available small animal model for HRSV. Intranasal HRSV infection three days later resulted in strain-specific enhancement of HRSV replication in vivo. One S. pneumoniae strain enhanced HRSV both in vitro and in vivo, and was also associated with enhanced syncytium formation in vivo. However, neither pneumococci nor HRSV were found to spread from the upper to the lower respiratory tract, and neither pathogen was transmitted to naive cage mates by direct contact. These results demonstrate that pneumococcal colonization can enhance subsequent HRSV infection, and provide tools for additional mechanistic and intervention studies.},

abstract = {Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are leading causes of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in children worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify viral pathogens responsible for SARI in northern Vietnam in the period from 2011 to 2014. Throat swabs and tracheal aspirates were collected from SARI patients according to WHO guidelines. The presence of 13 different viral pathogens (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09; A/H3N2; A/H5; A/H7 and B; para influenza 1,2,3; RSV; HMPV; adeno; severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and rhino) was tested by conventional/real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. During the study period, 975 samples were collected and tested. More than 30{\%} (32.1{\%}, 313 samples) of the samples showed evidence of infection with influenza viruses, including A/H3N2 (48 samples), A (H1N1) pdm09 (221 samples), influenza B (42 samples), and co-infection of A (H1N1) pdm09 or A/H3N2 and influenza B (2 samples). Other respiratory pathogens were detected in 101 samples, including rhinovirus (73 samples), adenovirus (10 samples), hMPV (9 samples), parainfluenza 3 (5 samples), parainfluenza 2 (3 samples), and RSV (1 sample). Influenza A/H5, A/H7, or SARS-CoV were not detected. Respiratory viral infection, particularly infection of influenza and rhinoviruses, were associated with high rates of SARI hospitalization, and future studies correlating the clinical aspects are needed to design interventions, including targeted vaccination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by the interaction between genetic vulnerability and environmental factors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators involved in multiple aspects of brain development and function. Previous studies have investigated miRNAs expression in ASD using non-neural cells like lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) or postmortem tissues. However, the relevance of LCLs is questionable in the context of a neurodevelopmental disorder, and the impact of the cause of death and/or post-death handling of tissue likely contributes to the variations observed between studies on brain samples. METHODS: miRNA profiling using TLDA high-throughput real-time qPCR was performed on miRNAs extracted from olfactory mucosal stem cells (OMSCs) biopsied from eight patients and six controls. This tissue is considered as a closer tissue to neural stem cells that could be sampled in living patients and was never investigated for such a purpose before. Real-time PCR was used to validate a set of differentially expressed miRNAs, and bioinformatics analysis determined common pathways and gene targets. Luciferase assays and real-time PCR analysis were used to evaluate the effect of miRNAs misregulation on the expression and translation of several autism-related transcripts. Viral vector-mediated expression was used to evaluate the impact of miRNAs deregulation on neuronal or glial cells functions. RESULTS: We identified a signature of four miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-221, miR-654-5p, and miR-656) commonly deregulated in ASD. This signature is conserved in primary skin fibroblasts and may allow discriminating between ASD and intellectual disability samples. Putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for pathways previously associated to ASD, and altered levels of neuronal transcripts targeted by miR-146a, miR-221, and miR-656 were observed in patients' cells. In the mouse brain, miR-146a, and miR-221 display strong neuronal expression in regions important for high cognitive functions, and we demonstrated that reproducing abnormal miR-146a expression in mouse primary cell cultures leads to impaired neuronal dendritic arborization and increased astrocyte glutamate uptake capacities. CONCLUSIONS: While independent replication experiments are needed to clarify whether these four miRNAS could serve as early biomarkers of ASD, these findings may have important diagnostic implications. They also provide mechanistic connection between miRNA dysregulation and ASD pathophysiology and may open up new opportunities for therapeutic.},

To investigate the RSV burden in Laos, we conducted a one-year study in children {\textless}5 years old admitted to Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane Capital, to describe clinical and epidemiological characteristics and predictive factors for severity of RSV-associated ARI. Pooled nasal and throat swabs were tested using multiplex real-time PCR for 33 respiratory pathogens (FTD({\textregistered}) kit). A total of 383 patients were included, 277 (72.3{\%}) of whom presented with pneumonia. 377 (98.4{\%}) patients were positive for at least one microorganism, of which RSV was the most common virus (41.0{\%}), with a peak observed between June and September, corresponding to the rainy season. Most RSV inpatients had pneumonia (84.1{\%}), of whom 35{\%} had severe pneumonia. Children {\textless}3-months old were a high-risk group for severe pneumonia, independently of RSV infection. Our study suggests that RSV infection is frequent in Laos and commonly associated with pneumonia in hospitalized young children. Further investigations are required to provide a better overall view of the Lao nationwide epidemiology and public health burden of RSV infection over time.},

Activation of HPV16 late gene expression included inhibition of the HPV16 early polyadenylation signal that resulted in read-through into the late region of HPV16. This was followed by activation of the exclusively late, HPV16 splice sites SD3632 and SA5639 and production of spliced late L1 mRNAs. Altered HPV16 mRNA processing was paralleled by increased association of phosphorylated BRCA1, BARD1, BCLAF1 and TRAP150 with HPV16 DNA, and increased association of RNA processing factors U2AF65 and hnRNP C with HPV16 mRNAs. These RNA processing factors inhibited HPV16 early polyadenylation and enhanced HPV16 late mRNA splicing, thereby activating HPV16 late gene expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transportation into the host cell nucleus is crucial for replication and transcription of influenza virus. The classical nuclear import is regulated by specific cellular factor, importin-$\alpha$. Seven isoforms of importin-$\alpha$ have been identified in human. The preference of importin-$\alpha$3 of avian influenza virus and -$\alpha$7 isoform of human strains during replication in human cells was previously identified. In addition, both avian and human influenza viruses were shown to use importin-$\alpha$1 isoform for their replication. FINDING: The mRNA levels of importin-$\alpha$1, -$\alpha$3, and -$\alpha$7 isoforms in human respiratory tract was determined by real-time RT-PCR. The results indicate that mRNA level of importin-$\alpha$7 was significantly higher than that of importin-$\alpha$1 (p-value {\textless} 0.0001) and importin-$\alpha$3 (p-value {\textless} 0.0001) isoforms in human nasal mucosa while importin-$\alpha$1 was detected as the highest expression importin-$\alpha$ isoform in lung tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These results may explain the preference of importin-$\alpha$7 isoforms in seasonal influenza viruses in human upper respiratory tract and may suggest a selective pressure toward importin-$\alpha$7 in human respiratory tract infection of an avian virus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated morbidity and mortality makes vaccine development a priority. METHODS: As part of an efficacy trial of pandemic influenza vaccines (NCT01051661), RSV epidemiology in healthy children aged 6 months to {\textless}10 years at first vaccination with influenza-like illness (ILI) was evaluated in Australia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand between February 2010 and August 2011. Active surveillance for ILI was conducted for approximately 1 year, with nasal and throat swabs analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence and incidence of RSV among ILI episodes were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 6266 children were included, of whom 2421 experienced 3717 ILI episodes with a respiratory sample available. RSV was detected for 359 ILI episodes, a prevalence of 9.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 8.7-10.7). The highest prevalence was in children aged 12-23 or 24-35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where it was in children aged 6-11 months. The incidence of RSV-associated ILI was 7.0 (6.3-7.7) per 100 person-years (PY). Eighty-eight ILI episodes resulted in hospitalization, of which 8 were associated with RSV (prevalence 9.1{\%} [4.0-17.1]; incidence 0.2 [0.1-0.3] per 100 PY). The incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.0 (5.4-6.7) per 100 PY. RSV B subtypes were observed more frequently than A subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance demonstrated the considerable burden of RSV-associated illness that would not be identified through hospital-based surveillance, with a substantial part of the burden occurring in older infants and children.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of mortality in infants and young children. Despite the RSV disease burden, no vaccine is available, and treatment remains nonspecific. New drug candidates are needed to combat RSV. Toward this goal, we screened over 2,000 compounds to identify approved drugs with novel anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides, inhibitors of the membrane-bound Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, were identified to have anti-RSV activity. Cardiac glycosides diminished RSV infection in human epithelial type 2 cells and in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface. Digoxin, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved cardiac glycoside, was also able to inhibit infection of primary nasal epithelial cells with community isolates of RSV. Our results suggest that the antiviral effects of cardiac glycosides may be dependent on changes in the intracellular Na(+) and K(+) composition. Consistent with this mechanism, we demonstrated that the ionophoric antibiotics salinomycin, valinomycin, and monensin inhibited RSV in human epithelial type 2 cells and primary nasal epithelial cells. Our data indicate that the K(+)/Na(+)-sensitive steps in the RSV life cycle occur within the initial 4 hours of viral infection but do not include virus binding/entry. Rather, our findings demonstrated a negative effect on the RSV transcription and/or replication process. Overall, this work suggests that targeting intracellular ion concentrations offers a novel antiviral strategy.},

Two personal bioaerosol samplers, the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler and the personal high-flow inhalable sampler head (PHISH), were placed in the breathing zone of veterinarians treating swine infected with either H1N1 or H3N2 influenza A. A greater number of viral particles were recovered from the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler (2094 RNA copies/m3) compared to the PHISH sampler (545 RNA copies/m3). In addition, the majority of viral particles were detected by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler in the {\textgreater}4 $\mu$m size fraction.

We developed a straightforward eukaryotic host nucleic acid depletion method that preserves intact viruses and bacteria for subsequent shotgun metagenomics screening of clinical samples, focusing on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A surrogate CSF sample for a CNS infection paradigm was used to evaluate the proposed depletion method consisting of selective host cell lysis, followed by enzymatic degradation of the liberated genomic DNA for final depletion with paramagnetic beads. Extractives were subjected to reverse transcription, followed by whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing. The effectiveness of the host depletion method was demonstrated in surrogate CSF samples spiked with three 1:100 dilutions of Influenza A H3N2 virus (qPCR Ct-values 20.7, 28.8, {\textgreater}42/negative). Compared to the native samples, host depletion increased the amount of the virus subtype reads by factor 7127 and 132, respectively, while in the qPCR negative sample zero vs. 31 (1.4E-4 {\%}) virus subtype reads were detected (native vs. depleted). The workflow was applied to thirteen CSF samples of patients with meningo-/encephalitis (two bacterial, eleven viral etiologies), a serum of an Andes virus infection and a nose swab of a common cold patient. Unlike surrogate samples, host depletion of the thirteen human CSF samples and the nose swab did not result in more reads indicating presence of damaged pathogens due to, e.g., host immune response. Nevertheless, previously diagnosed pathogens in the human CSF samples (six viruses, two bacteria), the serum, and the nose swab (Human rhinovirus A31) were detected in the depleted and/or the native samples. Unbiased evaluation of the taxonomic profiles supported the diagnosed pathogen in two native CSF samples and the native and depleted serum and nose swab, while detecting various contaminations that interfered with pathogen identification at low concentration levels. In summary, damaged pathogens and contaminations complicated analysis and interpretation of clinical shotgun metagenomics data. Still, proper consideration of these issues may enable future application of metagenomics for clinical diagnostics.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The burden of HPV-related Head and Neck Cancers (HNC) has been rising in the U.S. and other developed countries but this trend has not been reported in Africa. Objective of study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in HNC cancer cases seen between 1990 and 2011 at the tertiary health care institutions in Nigeria. METHODS: We retrieved 149 head and neck cancer formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor specimens diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 from four teaching hospitals in Nigeria. One hundred and twenty-three blocks (83{\%}) contained appropriate HNC for analysis while DNA extraction was successful in 60{\%} (90/149). PCR amplification was successful in 33{\%} (49/149) and Linear Array genotyping for HPV was successful in 11{\%} (17/149) of these cases. These were in tumors from the larynx (6), cervical lymph nodes (3), nasal cavity (2), parotid (1), palate (1), maxillary sinus (1) and mandible (1). Two cases were non-specific and none were from the oropharynx. Histologically, 41{\%} (7/17) of the successfully genotyped blocks were squamous cell carcinomas (larynx 6, maxillary sinus 1). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We were unable to detect HPV in any of the HNC samples in our study. Our result may suggest that there is a low prevalence of HPV-related HNC among the adult population in Nigeria. Our results provide a benchmark to compare future incidence of HPV -related HNC in this community in future. We had significant analytical challenges from possible poor tissue processing and urge that future studies should prospectively collect samples and ensure high quality sample processing.},

abstract = {Most studies exploring the role of upper airway viruses and bacteria in paediatric acute respiratory infections (ARI) focus on specific clinical diagnoses and/or do not account for virus-bacteria interactions. We aimed to describe the frequency and predictors of virus and bacteria codetection in children with ARI and cough, irrespective of clinical diagnosis. Bilateral nasal swabs, demographic, clinical and risk factor data were collected at enrollment in children aged {\textless}15 years presenting to an emergency department with an ARI and where cough was a symptom. Swabs were tested by polymerase chain reaction for 17 respiratory viruses and seven respiratory bacteria. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between child characteristics and codetection of the organisms of interest. Between December 2011 and August 2014, swabs were collected from 817 (93.3{\%}) of 876 enrolled children, median age 27.7 months (interquartile range 13.9-60.3 months). Overall, 740 (90.6{\%}) of 817 specimens were positive for any organism. Both viruses and bacteria were detected in 423 specimens (51.8{\%}). Factors associated with codetection were age (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for age {\textless}12 months = 4.9, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 3.0, 7.9; age 12 to {\textless}24 months = 6.0, 95{\%} CI 3.7, 9.8; age 24 to {\textless}60 months = 2.4, 95{\%} CI 1.5, 3.9), male gender (aOR 1.46; 95{\%} CI 1.1, 2.0), child care attendance (aOR 2.0; 95{\%} CI 1.4, 2.8) and winter enrollment (aOR 2.0; 95{\%} CI 1.3, 3.0). Haemophilus influenzae dominated the virus-bacteria pairs. Virus-H. influenzae interactions in ARI should be investigated further, especially as the contribution of nontypeable H. influenzae to acute and chronic respiratory diseases is being increasingly recognized.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural killer (NK) cells in the upper respiratory airways are not well characterized. In the current study, we sought to characterize and functionally assess murine nasal NK cells. METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, we compared the nasal NK cells of Ncr1GFP/+ knock-in mice, whose NK cells produced green fluorescent protein, with their splenic and pulmonary counterparts. In addition, we functionally analyzed the nasal NK cells of these mice in vitro. To assess the in vivo functions of nasal NK cells, C57BL/6 mice depleted of NK cells after treatment with PK136 antibody were nasally infected with influenza virus PR8. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of NK cells in the lamina propria of nasal mucosa, and flow cytometry showed that these cells were of NK cell lineage. The expression patterns of Ly49 receptor, CD11b/CD27, CD62L and CD69 revealed that nasal NK cells had an immature and activated phenotype compared with that of their splenic and pulmonary counterparts. Effector functions including degranulation and IFN(interferon)-$\gamma$ production after in vitro stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate plus ionomycin or IL(interleukin)-12 plus IL-18 were dampened in nasal NK cells, and the depletion of NK cells led to an increased influenza virus titer in nasal passages. CONCLUSIONS: The NK cells of the murine nasal passage belong to the conventional NK cell linage and characteristically demonstrate an immature and activated phenotype. Despite their hyporesponsiveness in vitro, nasal NK cells play important roles in the host defense against nasal influenza virus infection.},

abstract = {Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BHV5) infection of young cattle is frequently associated with fatal neurological disease and, as such, represents an attractive model for studying the pathogenesis of viral-induced meningoencephalitis. Following replication in the nasal mucosa, BHV5 invades the central nervous system (CNS) mainly through the olfactory pathway. The innate immune response triggered by the host face to virus replication through the olfactory route is poorly understood. Recently, an upregulation of conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern, as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been demonstrated in the CNS of BHV5 experimentally infected cows. A new perspective to understand host-pathogen interactions has emerged elucidating microRNAs (miRNAs) network that interact with innate immune response during neurotropic viral infections. In this study, we demonstrated a link between the expression of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 and miR-155 transcription in the olfactory bulbs (OB) of 16 cows suffering from acute BHV5-induced neurological disease. The OBs were analyzed for viral antigens and genome, miR-155 and TLR 3, 7, and 9 expression considering three major regions: olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), glomerular layer (GL), and mitral cell layer (ML). BHV5 antigens and viral genomes, corresponding to glycol-C gene, were detected in all OBs regions by fluorescent antibody assay (FA) and PCR, respectively. TLR 3, 7, and 9 transcripts were upregulated in ORNs and ML, yet only ORN layers revealed a positive correlation between TLR3 and miR-155 transcription. In ML, miR-155 correlated positively with all TLRs studied. Herein, our results evidence miR-155 transcription in BHV5 infected OB tissue associated to TLRs expression specifically ORNs which may be a new window for further studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In order to prevent spread of the endemic pathogens bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) between herds, knowledge of indirect transmission by personnel and fomites is fundamental. The aims of the study were to determine the duration of viral RNA carriage and the infectivity of viral particles on fomites and human nasal mucosa after exposure to BCoV and BRSV. During two animal infection experiments, swabs were collected from personnel (nasal mucosa) and their clothes, boots and equipment after contact with calves shedding either virus. Viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR or droplet digital RT-PCR (RT-ddPCR), and selected samples with high levels of viral RNA were tested by cell culture for infectivity. RESULTS: For BCoV, 46{\%} (n = 80) of the swabs from human nasal mucosa collected 30 min after exposure were positive by RT-qPCR. After two, four and six hours, 15{\%}, 5{\%} and 0{\%} of the swabs were positive, respectively. Infective virions were not detected in mucosal swabs (n = 2). A high viral RNA load was detected on 97{\%} (n = 44) of the fomites 24 h after exposure, and infective virions were detected in two of three swabs. For BRSV, 35{\%} (n = 26) of the human nasal mucosa swabs collected 30 min after exposure, were positive by RT-ddPCR, but none were positive for infective virions. Of the fomites, 89{\%} (n = 38) were positive for BRSV RNA 24 h after exposure, but all were negative for infective viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that human nasal mucosa can carry both BCoV and BRSV RNA after exposure to virus shedding calves, but the carriage seems short-lived and the transmission potential is likely limited. High viral loads on contaminates fomites 24 h after exposure to infected animals, and detection of infective BCoV, indicate that contaminated fomites represent a significant risk for indirect transmission between herds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a widely distributed pathogen, causing disease and economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to na{\"{i}}ve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. METHODS: A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four na{\"{i}}ve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two na{\"{i}}ve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. RESULTS: The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.},

abstract = {We describe the first genome isolation of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Kenya. This fatal zoonotic pathogen was first described in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012. Epidemiological and molecular evidence revealed zoonotic transmission from camels to humans and between humans. Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018. A total of 792 camel plasma samples were positive by ELISA. Seroprevalence increased with age, and the highest prevalence was observed in adult camels (82.37{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 79.50-84.91). More female camels were significantly seropositive (74.28{\%}, 95{\%} CI 71.14-77.19) than male camels (P {\textless} 0.001) (53.74{\%}, 95{\%} CI 48.48-58.90). Only 11 camel nasal swabs were positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences showed that Kenyan MERS-CoV clustered within sub-clade C2, which is associated with the African clade, but did not contain signature deletions of orf4b in African viruses. None of the human plasma screened contained neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. This study confirms the geographically widespread occurrence of MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels. Further one-health surveillance approaches in camels, wildlife, and human populations are needed.},

abstract = {AIM: Study the circulation of respiratory viruses in children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) during the period from October 2012 to May 2013. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 136 children with CAP aged from 3 months to 16 years with ARI symptoms at the disease debut were studied. RNA/DNA of influenza A, B, parainfluenza (PI); adeno-, rhino-, RS-viruses, corona-, metapneumo- (MPV) and bocaviruses were detected in nasopharynx smears by PCR with hybridization-fluorescent detection in real time. Antibodies against influenza viruses A/H1N1/pdm09 California/07/09, epidemic reference strains of influenza viruses A/H1N1/Brisbane/59/07, A/ H3N2/Victoria/361/201 1, B/Wisconsin/1/10, against PI viruses type 1, 2, 3 were determined in paired sera by HAI. RESULTS: In February-March 2013 the number of children protected by antibodies against influenza decreased, and circulation of influenza viruses A/H3N2 and A/H1N1/ pdm09 was detected. Rhinoviruses and PI viruses were determined throughout the epidemic season, bocavirus and adenoviruses--during the autumn-winter period, RS-virus and MPV--during winter-spring. Coronaviruses were not detected. The peak of virus detection was established in February when the threshold of influenza and ARI morbidity was exceeded. The main pathogens of children of the first 3 years of life are rhinoviruses, RS-virus, PI viruses and bocavirus. RS-virus infection at the debut of CAP in children younger than 3 years in 55.5{\%} of cases is associated with the development of broncho-obstructive syndrome. Bocavirus infection in 50{\%} of cases progresses with laryngo-tracheitis and bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION: The fraction of viruses in etiologic structure ofARI in children varies depending on immune layer, season and age of children. Etiology of viral infection at the debut of CAP could only be proven using specialized laboratory studies.},

abstract = {This study aimed to determine the role of influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance conducted on Leyte Island, the Philippines, including involvement of other respiratory viruses, from 2010 to 2013. ILI surveillance was conducted from January 2010 to March 2013 with 3 sentinel sites located in Tacloban city, Palo and Tanauan of Leyte Island. ILI was defined as fever ≥38°C or feverish feeling and either cough or running nose in a patient of any age. Influenza virus and other 5 respiratory viruses were searched. A total of 5,550 ILI cases visited the 3 sites and specimens were collected from 2,031 (36.6{\%}) cases. Among the cases sampled, 1,637 (75.6{\%}) were children aged {\textless}5 years. 874 (43.0{\%}) cases were positive for at least one of the respiratory viruses tested. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were predominantly detected (both were 25.7{\%}) followed by human rhinovirus (HRV) (17.5{\%}). The age distributions were significantly different between those who were positive for influenza, HRV, and RSV. ILI cases were reported throughout the year and influenza virus was co-detected with those viruses on approximately half of the weeks of study period (RSV in 60.5{\%} and HRV 47.4{\%}). In terms of clinical manifestations, only the rates of headache and sore throat were significantly higher in influenza positive cases than cases positive to other viruses. In conclusion, syndromic ILI surveillance in this area is difficult to detect the start of influenza epidemic without laboratory confirmation which requires huge resources. Age was an important factor that affected positive rates of influenza and other respiratory viruses. Involvement of older age children may be useful to detect influenza more effectively.},

abstract = {Viruses with pandemic potential including H1N1, H5N1, and H5N7 influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)/Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoV) have emerged in recent years. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus can survive on surfaces for extended periods, sometimes up to months. Factors influencing the survival of these viruses on surfaces include: strain variation, titre, surface type, suspending medium, mode of deposition, temperature and relative humidity, and the method used to determine the viability of the virus. Environmental sampling has identified contamination in field-settings with SARS-CoV and influenza virus, although the frequent use of molecular detection methods may not necessarily represent the presence of viable virus. The importance of indirect contact transmission (involving contamination of inanimate surfaces) is uncertain compared with other transmission routes, principally direct contact transmission (independent of surface contamination), droplet, and airborne routes. However, influenza virus and SARS-CoV may be shed into the environment and be transferred from environmental surfaces to hands of patients and healthcare providers. Emerging data suggest that MERS-CoV also shares these properties. Once contaminated from the environment, hands can then initiate self-inoculation of mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth. Mathematical and animal models, and intervention studies suggest that contact transmission is the most important route in some scenarios. Infection prevention and control implications include the need for hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to minimize self-contamination and to protect against inoculation of mucosal surfaces and the respiratory tract, and enhanced surface cleaning and disinfection in healthcare settings.},

abstract = {The control of swine influenza virus (SIV) infection is paramount for increasing the productivity of pig farming and minimizing the threat of pandemic outbreaks. Thus, SIV surveillance should be conducted by region and on a regular basis. Here, we established a microneutralization assay specific for SIV seroprevalence surveillance by using reporter gene-expressing recombinant influenza viruses. Growth-based SIV seroprevalence revealed that most sows and piglets were positive for neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses. In contrast, the 90-day-old growing pigs exhibited limited neutralizing activity in their sera, suggesting that this particular age of population is most susceptible to SIV infection and thus is an ideal age group for SIV isolation. From nasal swab specimens of healthy pigs in this age population, we were able to isolate SIVs at a higher incidence (5.3{\%}) than those of previous reports. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) genes revealed that the isolated SIVs have circulated and evolved in pigs but not have been recently introduced from humans, implying that a large number of SIV lineages may remain "undiscovered" in the global porcine populations. We propose that the 90-day-old growing pig-targeted nasal swab collection presented in this study facilitates global SIV surveillance and contributes to the detection and control of SIV infection.},

abstract = {The knowledge about the viral etiologies causing respiratory disease in adults is limited. Viral respiratory diseases may lead deterioration in certain patient populations. The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiologies of influenza-like illness among patients requiring hospitalization and to document the risk factors for mortality. This prospective study was performed in one of the 7 centers in Turkey in the context of influenza surveillance by the Global Influenza Hospital Surveillance Network. A 35-bed Adult Emergency Service and 10-bed Acute Care Unit were screened for consequent recruitment of eligible patients daily, on weekdays only. ICD-10 codes in the electronic health records and direct patient encounters were used to screen for the following eligibility diagnoses: acute respiratory tract infection, asthma, heart failure, pneumonia, influenza, chronic obstructive lung disease, dyspnea/respiratory abnormality, respiratory symptoms, cough and fever. A total of 334 patients who were admitted with the eligible ICD-10 codes within the 24th and 48th hours were screened during the study period and of those eligible ones, 106 consented and were swabbed. Nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using Virocult (Medical Wire {\&} Equipment, UK) and sent to the central laboratory in 1-3 days. Swabs were collected and specimens were introduced to real-time polymerase chain reaction based multiplex kits, as well as, ABI 7500 platform with CDC primers and probes. A total of 106 patients were swabbed. Hospital mortality was 12.2{\%}. More than one fourth of the patients needed a sort of mechanical ventilation support and at least one organ failure developed in one third of the patients. One or more viral pathogens were detected in 56 (52.8{\%}) of the swabbed patients, with influenza H3N2 being the most prevalent one. Having a lower body mass index (OR, 0.845, p= 0.034) was associated with mortality. Chronic lung diseases were shown to confer a survival advantage (OR, 0.127, p= 0.009). Community acquired viral respiratory infections might lead to significant compromise in adult patients. Prevention of malnutrition might result in better outcomes in patients who need acute admission. The survival advantage of those with chronic lung diseases warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {In the adult olfactory epithelium, the transcription factors Pax6 and Sox2 are co-expressed in sustentacular cells, horizontal basal cells (HBCs), and less-differentiated globose basal cells (GBCs)-both multipotent and transit amplifying categories-but are absent from immediate neuronal precursor GBCs and olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). We used retroviral-vector transduction to over-express Pax6 and Sox2 individually and together during post-lesion recovery to determine how they regulate neuronal differentiation. Both Pax6 and Sox2, separately and together, can suppress the production of OSNs, as fewer clones contain neurons than with empty vector (EV), although this effect is not absolute. In this regard, Pax6 has the strongest effect when acting alone. In clones where neurons form, Pax6 reduces neuron numbers by comparison with EV, while Sox2 expands their numbers. Co-transduction with Pax6 and Sox2 produces an intermediate result. The increased production of OSNs driven by Sox2 is due to the expansion of neuronal progenitors, since proliferation and the numbers of Ascl1, Neurog1, and NeuroD1-expressing GBCs are increased. Conversely, Pax6 seems to accelerate neuronal differentiation, since Ascl1 labeling is reduced, while Neurog1- and NeuroD1-labeled GBCs are enriched. As a complement to the over-expression experiments, elimination of Sox2 in spared cells of floxed Sox2 mice, by retroviral Cre or by K5-driven CreERT2, reduces the production of OSNs and non-neuronal cells during OE regeneration. These data suggest that Pax6 and Sox2 have counteracting roles in regulating neurogenesis, in which Pax6 accelerates neuronal production, while Sox2 retards it and expands the pool of neuronal progenitors.},

Analysis of the HN gene from ten additional PPIV1-positive samples found 85.0-95.5{\%} identity, suggesting genetic diversity between strains. Molecular analysis identified 17 out of 279 (6.1{\%}) positive samples from pigs with respiratory disease. Eleven nursery pigs from a naturally infected herd were asymptomatic; however, nasal swabs from six pigs and the lungs of a single pig were quantitative reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR positive. Histopathology identified PPIV1 RNA in the nasal respiratory epithelium and trachea. Two serological assays demonstrated seroconversion of infected pigs and further analysis of 59 swine serum samples found 52.5{\%} and 66.1{\%} seropositivity, respectively. Taken together, the results confirm the widespread presence of PPIV1 in the US swine herd.},

To analyse the overall burden of respiratory viruses responsible for ARTIs in paediatrics population in eastern India, this study was performed. Clinical information, demographic information and nasal/oral swabs were collected from 332 paediatric patients (aged from 1 month to 12 years old) with the symptoms of ARTI, enrolled from the outpatient department from Nov 2012 to Oct 2014. Multiplex PCR was performed to detect eight respiratory viral pathogens. Seasonal, as well as age-wise prevalence of respiratory viruses was analysed. Of these 332 cases, 32.53{\%} (108/332) were positive for at least one pathogen. Human rhinovirus (HRV) was the most frequently detected pathogen (24.7{\%}, 82/332) followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (4.22{\%}, 14/332), PIV (2.11{\%}, 7/332), and hMPV (2.11{\%}, 7/332). Single infection was detected in 92.6{\%} (100/108) of positive cases. Respiratory virus infections showed seasonal variation, with peaks during the rainy season followed by winter season, and were most common in patients under 1 year of age. Phylogenetic analysis of HMPV positive samples confirmed the circulation of A2 subgroup in the study area. The present study is first of its kind and adds to our knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of these common respiratory viruses among patients with ARTIs in the study area. J. Med.

abstract = {The development of therapeutic bacteriophages will provide several benefits based on an understanding the basic physiological dynamics of phage and bacteria interactions for therapeutic use in light of the results of antibiotic abuse. However, studies on bacteriophage therapeutics against microbes are very limited, because of lack of phage stability and an incomplete understanding of the physiological intracellular mechanisms of phage. The major objective of this investigation was to provide opportunity for development of a novel therapeutic treatment to control respiratory diseases in swine. The cytokine array system was used to identify the secreted cytokines/chemokines after Bordetella bronchiseptica infection into swine nasal turbinate cells (PT-K75). We also performed the real-time quantitative PCR method to investigate the gene expression regulated by B. bronchiseptica infection or bacteriophage treatment. We found that B. bronchiseptica infection of PT-K75 induces secretion of many cytokines/chemokines to regulate airway inflammation. Of them, secretion and expression of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-6 are increased in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, membrane-bound mucin production via expression of the Muc1 gene is increased in B. bronchiseptica-infected PT-K75 cells. However, cytokine production and Muc1 gene expression are dramatically inhibited by treatment with a specific B. bronchiseptica bacteriophage (Bor-BRP-1). The regulation of cytokine profiles in B. bronchiseptica-induced inflammation by B. bronchiseptica bacteriophage is essential for avoiding inappropriate inflammatory responses. The ability of bacteriophages to downregulate the immune response by inhibiting bacterial infection emphasizes the possibility of bacteriophage-based therapies as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy in swine respiratory tracts.},

abstract = {The role of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) carrier cattle in causing new outbreaks is still a matter of debate and it is important to find out these carrier animals by post-outbreak serosurveillance to declare freedom from FMDV infection. In this study we explore the differences in viral shedding between carrier and non-carrier animals, quantify the transmission rate of FMDV infection from carriers to susceptible animals and identify potential viral determinants of viral persistence. We collected nasal and saliva samples from 32 vaccinated and 7 unvaccinated FMDV carrier cattle and 48 vaccinated and 13 unvaccinated non-carrier cattle (total n=100) during the acute phase of infection (up to 28 days post-challenge) and then from limited number of animals up to a maximum 168 days post-challenge. We demonstrate that unvaccinated cattle excrete significantly higher levels of virus for longer periods compared with vaccinated cattle and this is independent of whether or not they subsequently become carriers. By introducing na{\"{i}}ve cattle in to the FMDV carrier population we show the risk of new outbreaks is clearly very low in controlled conditions, although there could still be a potential threat of these carrier animals causing new outbreaks in the field situation. Finally, we compared the complete genome sequences of viruses from carrier cattle with the challenge virus and found no evidence for viral determinants of the carrier state.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) in infants and young children globally. RSV presents two antigenic groups RSV-A and -B. Genetic variability is also very high within each group. RSV circulation varies year to year and even varies among different regions. Data on circulatory pattern of RSV are available from other parts of India except Kerala. The aim of the study was to generate data about groups and genotypes of circulating RSV in Kerala. In this study, RSV positive samples received during January, 2012 to December, 2014 were used for genetic characterization. The samples were tested by using nucleocapsid (N) gene-based conventional multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to identify the RSV group. Genotyping was done by nucleotide sequencing of the C-terminal region of the glycoprotein (G) gene. Out of the 130 patient samples tested, 49 samples were positive for RSV. Among the positive samples, 32 belong to the RSV-A and 17 belong to RSV-B virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all RSV-A sequences (n = 22) belonged to NA1 genotype and five of the sequences showed the novel 72 nucleotide duplication and clustered into the newly designated ON1 genotype. All RSV-B sequences (n = 17) were clustered into the BA (BA9 and 10) genotype. From this study, we concluded both RSV-A and -B were co-circulated in Kerala and RSV-A was observed predominantly in 2012 and RSV-B in 2014. As per our best of knowledge, BA10 genotype is first observed in India.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (RHS) and Bell palsy (BP) are typically known as facial nerve motor syndromes and are primarily unilateral. The aim of this study was to challenge this assertion, because both conditions are also known to be associated with viruses that typically affect several nerves. METHODS: Ten participants with RHS, 12 with BP, all clinically unilateral, and 12 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. Electrogustometric thresholds were measured bilaterally in the areas of the chorda tympani, the glossopharyngeal, and the major petrosal nerve. Also bilaterally, the taste function was tested using chemogustometry with different tastant concentrations. Again bilaterally, the morphology of the mucosa and the vessels of the anterior fungiform papillae were examined by contact endoscopy. Statistically, RHS and BP participants were compared with the healthy controls, and the paretic sides of RHS and BP were compared pairwise with their mobile sides. RESULTS: Electrogustometrically, perception was reduced bilaterally in RHS (10-19dB, p {\textless} 0.001) and BP (3-5dB, p = 0.011-0.030) in all 3 innervation areas. Chemogustometrically, it was also reduced bilaterally in RHS (20-70{\%}) and BP (8-50{\%}). Papillary atrophies were increased 100{\%} in RHS (p = 0.001) and BP (p {\textless} 0.001). They were more increased on the paretic side in RHS (30{\%}, p = 0.078) and BP (83{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). INTERPRETATION: In these 2 clinically unilateral conditions, the gustatory perception and morphology are bilaterally affected, more in RHS and more on the paretic side. BP, known as an isolated motor condition, appears to be a cranial polyneuritis. A bilateral examination and therapeutic gustatory monitoring might follow these observations in evidence-based practice. Ann Neurol 2018;83:807-815.},

abstract = {Human rhinovirus infection (HRVI) plays an important role in asthma exacerbations and is thought to be involved in asthma development during early childhood. We hypothesized that HRVI causes differential DNA methylation and subsequently differential mRNA expression in epithelial cells of children with asthma. Primary nasal epithelial cells from children with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) asthma were cultivated up to passage two and infected with Rhinovirus-16 (RV-16). HRVI-induced genome-wide differences of DNA methylation in asthmatics (vs. controls) and resulting mRNA expression were analyzed by the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina) and RNA sequencing. These results were further verified by pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR, respectively. 471 CpGs belonging to 268 genes were identified to have HRVI-induced asthma-specifically modified DNA methylation and mRNA expression. A minimum-change criteria was applied to restrict assessment of genes with changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression of at least 3{\%} and least 0.1 reads/kb per million mapped reads, respectively. Using this approach we identified 16 CpGs, including HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) and Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), involved in host immune response against HRVI. HRVI in nasal epithelial cells leads to specific modifications of DNA methylation with altered mRNA expression in children with asthma. The HRVI-induced alterations in DNA methylation occurred in genes involved in the host immune response against viral infections and asthma pathogenesis. The findings of our pilot study may partially explain how HRVI contribute to the persistence and progression of asthma, and aid to identify possible new therapeutic targets. The promising findings of this pilot study would benefit from replication in a larger cohort.},

The authors herein document 4 cases in White, North American individuals between the ages of 39 and 73 years. Their skin lesions were located on the legs in 2 cases, and they were multifocal in the other 2 patients. Microscopically, each neoplasm manifested as a dense infiltrate of cytologically aberrant lymphocytes in the dermis and subcutis. The lesional cells were angiocentric, with associated infarctive-type necrosis of the surrounding tissue. All tumors were labeled for CD3 and CD56; 3 also expressed T-cell intracellular antigen 1. Chromogenic in situ hybridization was intensely reactive for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded ribonucleic acid in each case. All patients died of their tumors or were likely to do so. The pathologic differential diagnosis of "nasal-type" natural killer/T-cell lymphoma in the skin principally centers on $\gamma$-$\delta$ T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Integrated analysis of histologic, immunohistochemical, genotypic, and in situ hybridization data is necessary to separate these entities from one another.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 250 million children under the age of five suffer from vitamin A deficiencies (VAD). Individuals with VAD experience higher rates of mortality and increased morbidity during enteric and respiratory infections compared with those who are vitamin A sufficient. Previously, our laboratory has demonstrated that VAD mice have significantly impaired virus-specific IgA and CD8(+) T-cell responses in the airways. Here, we demonstrate that VAD mice experience enhanced cytokine/chemokine gene expression and release in the respiratory tract 10 days following virus infection compared with control vitamin A sufficient animals. Cytokines/chemokines that are reproducibly up-regulated at the gene expression and protein levels include IFN$\gamma$ and IL-6. Despite previous indications that cytokine dysregulation in VAD animals might reflect low forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)-positive regulatory T-cell frequencies, we found no reduction in FoxP3(+) T cells in VAD respiratory tissues. As an alternative explanation for the high cytokine levels, we found that the extent of virus infection and the persistence of viral antigens were increased on day 10 post-infection in VAD animals compared with controls, and consequently that respiratory tract tissues had an increased potential to activate virus-specific T cells. Results encourage cautious management of viral infections in patients with VAD, as efforts to enhance FoxP3(+) T cell frequencies and quell immune effectors could potentially exacerbate disease if the virus has not been cleared.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Influenza is an RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. It causes a highly contagious acute respiratory illness, has been recognized since ancient times, and is a major health threat throughout the world. An outbreak of influenza-like illness (ILI) was reported from Alappuzha district of Kerala State between late June and July 2011. This investigation was conducted to determine the clinical picture, causative agents, and epidemiological characteristics of the illness. METHODOLOGY: The World Health Organization (WHO)'s case definition for ILI was followed throughout the investigation. Nasal or throat swabs were collected from 204 suspected patients. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based diagnosis was performed to detect influenza A and B viruses and their subtypes. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line was used for virus isolation. One-step RT-PCR was performed to amplify the HA1 gene of influenza A(H3N2). The amplicons for the HA1 gene of influenza A(H3N2) were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was done. RESULTS: Analysis of the data revealed that 96 (47.05{\%}) of the 204 respiratory specimens collected were influenza A(H3N2) and only 6 (2.94{\%}) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolated A(H3N2) was closely related to the 2012-2013 northern hemisphere vaccine strain (A/Victoria/361/2011/H3N2). CONCLUSIONS: An influenza A(H3N2) outbreak was confirmed in Alappuzha district of Kerala state with a co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09. No substantial difference in the sequence was observed in the etiological agent, and the virus was found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.},

abstract = {Venezuelan and western equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV and WEEV; Alphavirus; Togaviridae) are mosquito-borne pathogens causing central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans and equids. Adult CD-1 mice also develop CNS disease after infection with VEEV and WEEV. Adult CD-1 mice infected by the intranasal (i.n.) route, showed that VEEV and WEEV enter the brain through olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). In this study, we injected the mouse footpad with recombinant WEEV (McMillan) or VEEV (subtype IC strain 3908) expressing firefly luciferase (fLUC) to simulate mosquito infection and examined alphavirus entry in the CNS. Luciferase expression served as a marker of infection detected as bioluminescence (BLM) by in vivo and ex vivo imaging. BLM imaging detected WEEV and VEEV at 12 h postinoculation (hpi) at the injection site (footpad) and as early as 72 hpi in the brain. BLM from WEEV.McM-fLUC and VEEV.3908-fLUC injections was initially detected in the brain's circumventricular organs (CVOs). No BLM activity was detected in the olfactory neuroepithelium or OSNs. Mice were also injected in the footpad with WEEV.McM expressing DsRed (Discosoma sp.) and imaged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. DsRed imaging supported our BLM findings by detecting WEEV in the CVOs prior to spreading along the neuronal axis to other brain regions. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that peripherally injected alphaviruses enter the CNS by hematogenous seeding of the CVOs followed by centripetal spread along the neuronal axis. IMPORTANCE: VEEV and WEEV are mosquito-borne viruses causing sporadic epidemics in the Americas. Both viruses are associated with CNS disease in horses, humans, and mouse infection models. In this study, we injected VEEV or WEEV, engineered to express bioluminescent or fluorescent reporters (fLUC and DsRed, respectively), into the footpads of outbred CD-1 mice to simulate transmission by a mosquito. Reporter expression serves as detectable bioluminescent and fluorescent markers of VEEV and WEEV replication and infection. Bioluminescence imaging, histological examination, and confocal fluorescence microscopy were used to identify early entry sites of these alphaviruses in the CNS. We observed that specific areas of the brain (circumventricular organs [CVOs]) consistently showed the earliest signs of infection with VEEV and WEEV. Histological examination supported VEEV and WEEV entering the brain of mice at specific sites where the blood-brain barrier is naturally absent.},

abstract = {In March 2013, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A H7N9 virus. Infection with this virus often caused severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in a case fatality rate {\textgreater}35{\%}. The risk of pandemic highlighted, once again, the need for a more rapid and scalable vaccine response capability. Here, we describe the rapid (19 days) development of a plant-derived VLP vaccine based on the hemagglutinin sequence of influenza H7N9 A/Hangzhou/1/2013. The immunogenicity of the H7 VLP vaccine was assessed in mice and ferrets after one or two intramuscular dose(s) with and without adjuvant (alum or GLA-SE™). In ferrets, we also measured H7-specific cell-mediated immunity. The mice and ferrets were then challenged with H7N9 A/Anhui/1/2013 influenza virus. A single immunization with the adjuvanted vaccine elicited a strong humoral response and protected mice against an otherwise lethal challenge. Two doses of unadjuvanted vaccine significantly increased humoral response and resulted in 100{\%} protection with significant reduction of clinical signs leading to nearly asymptomatic infections. In ferrets, a single immunization with the alum-adjuvanted H7 VLP vaccine induced strong humoral and CMI responses with antigen-specific activation of CD3(+) T cells. Compared to animals injected with placebo, ferrets vaccinated with alum-adjuvanted vaccine displayed no weight loss during the challenge. Moreover, the vaccination significantly reduced the viral load in lungs and nasal washes 3 days after the infection. This candidate plant-made H7 vaccine therefore induced protective responses after either one adjuvanted or two unadjuvanted doses. Studies are currently ongoing to better characterize the immune response elicited by the plant-derived VLP vaccines. Regardless, these data are very promising for the rapid production of an immunogenic and protective vaccine against this potentially pandemic virus.},

In humans, the most commonly affected sites are the nose, eyes, skin wounds, sinuses, lungs, ears, gut, gall bladder, vagina, nasal cavities, and rarely the mouth because the oral tissues are rarely exposed to the external environment. The etiology of oral myiasis is usually related to local factors such as poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease and labial incompetence, and systemic factors such as neurologic deficits.},

abstract = {The incidence of Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing rapidly in the UK. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC generally show superior clinical responses relative to HPV-negative patients. We hypothesised that these superior responses could be associated with defective repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). The study aimed to determine whether defective DNA repair could be associated with sensitivity to inhibition of DNA repair using the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. Sensitivity to Olaparib, and induction and repair of DNA damage, were assessed in a panel of 8 OPSCC cell-lines, including 2 novel HPV-positive lines. Effects on cell cycle distribution and levels of PARP1 and p53 were quantified. RNA-sequencing was used to assess differences in activity of DNA repair pathways. Two HPV-positive OPSCC lines were sensitive to Olaparib at potentially therapeutic doses (0.1-0.5 $\mu$M). Two HPV-negative lines were sensitive at an intermediate dose. Four other lines, derived from HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumours, were resistant to PARP inhibition. Only one cell-line, UPCISCC90, showed results consistent with the original hypothesis i.e. that in HPV-positive cells, treatment with Olaparib would cause accumulation of DSB, resulting in cell cycle arrest. There was no evidence that HPV-positive tumours exhibit defective repair of DSB. However, the data suggest that a subset of OPSCC may be susceptible to PARP-inhibitor based therapy.},

abstract = {The lymphoid tissue that drains the upper respiratory tract represents an important induction site for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immunity to airborne pathogens and intranasal vaccines. Here, we investigated the role of the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs), which are mucosal-associated lymphoid organs embedded in the submucosa of the nasal passage, in the initial priming and recall expansion of CD8(+) T cells following an upper respiratory tract infection with a pathogenic influenza virus and immunization with a live attenuated influenza virus vaccine. Whereas NALTs served as the induction site for the recall expansion of memory CD8(+) T cells following influenza virus infection or vaccination, they failed to support activation of na{\"{i}}ve CD8(+) T cells. Strikingly, NALTs, unlike other lymphoid tissues, were not routinely surveyed during the steady state by circulating T cells. The selective recruitment of memory T cells into these lymphoid structures occurred in response to infection-induced elevation of the chemokine CXCL10, which attracted CXCR3(+) memory CD8(+) T cells. These results have significant implications for intranasal vaccines, which deliver antigen to mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue and aim to elicit protective CTL-mediated immunity.},

As part of a population-based, prospective study of work-related risk factors for transmission of viral infections (SWEDE-I), we developed a scheme for self-sampling with nasal swabs. Random selection from the gainfully employed population of a medium-sized town in central Sweden resulted in a study cohort of 2,237 men and women aged 25 to 63 years. From September 2011 through May 2012, the cohort reported all instances of respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis and participants concomitantly sent self-sampled nasal swabs for analysis using regular mail. Diagnosis of 14 viruses was performed. A total of 1,843 samples were received. The week-wise average delay between disease on set and arrival of the specimens at the laboratory varied between four and six days, and the corresponding median delay was between 3.5 and six days. In line with previous community-based studies, picorna- and coronaviruses dominated in specimens obtained from the self-sampling scheme. The results of self-sampling were contrasted to those from contemporaneous routine clinical sampling, on the same age group, in the adjacent Stockholm county. Although higher proportions of positive samples for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza were observed in the clinical sampling scheme, estimations of seasonality for influenza A and picornaviruses derived from both schemes were similar. Our findings show that nasal self-sampling is feasible in large-scale surveillance of respiratory infections and opens new prospects for population based,virologically verified research on virus spread,burden of disease, and effects of environmental factors or interventions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the 2015-2016 season, quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and both trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) were available in the United States. METHODS: This study, conducted according to a test-negative case-control design, enrolled children aged 2-17 years presenting to outpatient settings with fever and respiratory symptoms for {\textless}5 days at 8 sites across the United States between 30 November 2015 and 15 April 2016. A nasal swab was obtained for reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for influenza, and influenza vaccination was verified in the medical record or vaccine registry. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of 1012 children retained for analysis, most children (59{\%}) were unvaccinated, 10{\%} received LAIV, and 31{\%} received IIV. Influenza A (predominantly antigenically similar to the A/California/7/2009 strain) was detected in 14{\%} and influenza B (predominantly a B/Victoria lineage) in 10{\%}. For all influenza, VE was 46{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 7{\%}-69{\%}) for LAIV and 65{\%} (48{\%}-76{\%}) for IIV. VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 50{\%} (95{\%} CI, -2{\%} to 75{\%}) for LAIV and 71{\%} (51{\%}-82{\%}) for IIV. The odds ratio for vaccine failure with RT-PCR-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 was 1.71 (95{\%} CI, 0.78-3.73) in LAIV versus IIV recipients. CONCLUSIONS: LAIV and IIV demonstrated effectiveness against any influenza among children aged 2-17 years in 2015-2016. When compared to all unvaccinated children, VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was significant for IIV but not LAIV. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01997450.},

METHODS: Viral metagenomics and general PCR methods were used to detected viral nucleic acid in the samples from a diseased and healthy giant pandas. RESULTS: A novel polyomavirus, the giant panda polyomavirus 1 (GPPyV1) from the nasal cavity of a dead giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) was characterized. The GPPyV1 genome is 5144 bp in size and reveals five putative open-reading frames coding for the classic small and large T antigens in the early region, and the VP1, VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins in the late region. Phylogenetic analyses of the large T antigen of the GPPyV1 indicated GPPyV1 belonged to a putative new species within genus Deltapolyomavirus, clustering with four human polyomavirus species. The GPPyV1 VP1 and VP2 clustered with genus Alphapolyomavirus. Our epidemiologic study indicated that this novel polyomavirus was also detected in nasal swabs and fecal samples collected from captive healthy giant pandas. CONCLUSION: A novel polyomavirus was detected in giant pandas and its complete genome was characterized, which may cause latency infection in giant pandas.},

abstract = {Nasal mucosal barrier is a key impediment for the absorption of influenza whole inactivated virus (WIV) intranasal vaccine. Yet it is still unclear how WIV cross the epithelial cells (ECs) in nasal cavity. Here, in vitro, a coculture system was well established, consisting of surrogate nasal ECs (Calu-3) and dendritic cells (DCs). After adding H9N2 WIV on the apical side of ECs, we found that submucosal DCs extended their transepithelial dendrites (TEDs) and sampled luminal viruses. However, ECs were not involved in the transepithelial transport of viruses. Subsequently, the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs were also enhanced, whereas they were attenuated after blocking of TED formation by anti-JAM1 antibody. In vivo, we confirmed that H9N2 WIV were capable of inducing nasal submucosal DCs to sample luminal viruses via TEDs in the nasal passage but not nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). CD103(+) and CD103(-) DC subsets participated in this process. Of note, chemokine CCL20, released from the H9N2 WIV-induced ECs, played a vital role in DC recruitment and TED formation. Taken together, our findings indicated that TEDs played a critical role in facilitating viral transport across the epithelial barrier, which may guide the design of novel nasal mucosal vaccine strategies.},

abstract = {The spread of the low-pathogenicity avian H9N2 influenza virus has seriously increased the risk of a new influenza pandemic. Although whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine via intranasal pathway is the effective method of blocking virus transmission, the mucosal barrier seems to be a major factor hampering its development. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, a known adjuvant, can target downstream dendritic cells (DCs) and effectively enhance the mucosal and systemic immune responses. However, the ability of CpGs to assist H9N2 WIV in transepithelial transport remains unknown. Here, in vitro and in vivo, we showed that CpGs provided assistance for H9N2 WIV in recruiting DCs to the nasal epithelial cells (ECs) and forming transepithelial dendrites (TEDs) to capture luminal viruses. CD103(+) DCs participated in this process. Chemokine CCL20 from nasal ECs played a key role in driving DC recruitment and TED formation. Virus-loaded DCs quickly migrated into the draining cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) for antigen presentation. In addition, the competence of CpGs was independent of direct epithelial transport via the transcellular or paracellular pathway. Taken together, our data demonstrated that CpGs enhanced the transport of H9N2 WIV via TEDs of nasal DCs, which might be a novel mechanism for optimal adaptive immune responses. IMPORTANCE: This paper demonstrates by both an in vivo and an in vitro coculture model that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, known as an adjuvant generally targeting downstream immune responses, also are crucial for the transport of H9N2 WIV across nasal epithelial cells (ECs) via the uptake of transepithelial dendrites (TEDs). Our results prove for the first time to our knowledge that the immune-potentiating mechanism of CpGs is based on strengthening the transepithelial uptake of H9N2 WIV in nasal mucosa. These findings provide a fresh perspective for further improvement of intranasal influenza vaccines, which are urgently needed in the face of the potential threat of H9N2 influenza.},

abstract = {Recently, we demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between HPV-infection and SLPI-expression suggesting that SLPI protects against HPV-infection of HNSCC. Here we analyzed in a single lab setting 307 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HNSCC cases (tonsillar n = 135; non-tonsillar: n = 172) from eight health care centers. Samples were analyzed for SLPI gene- and protein-expression. Annexin A2, its heterotetramer A2t, putatively facilitating HPV- and SLPI-cell entry, was measured to study the correlation between SLPI and annexin A2. Data were correlated with tobacco consumption and HPV-status. Overall, HPV-DNA prevalence was 23.5{\%} (72/307); attributed to: 43.7{\%} (59/135) tonsillar and 7.6{\%} (13/172) non-tonsillar cases. Smoking resulted in 6.44-fold increased and HPV-infection in 3.46-fold decreased SLPI-gene expression in all HNSCC with similar significant results obtained in tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC separately. Correlating annexin A2- and SLPI-gene expression showed a significant surplus of annexin A2 in HPV-positive tumors (4.21× more annexin A2) and 6.72× more annexin A2 than SLPI in nonsmokers in all HNSCCs and similar significant results for both tumor entities separately. The surplus of annexin A2 in non-smokers and HPV-positive patients supports our hypothesis that decreased SLPI levels facilitate HPV-infection i.e., increased SLPI-expression may protect against HPV-infection of tonsillar and non-tonsillar SCC.},

abstract = {The increased knowledge regarding HPV-infections in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has unexpectedly contributed to several uncertainties related to i) prevalence diversities depending on tumour site and geographical origin of the patients, ii) proportion of HPV-driven tumours among HPV-DNA-positive cases, and iii) identification of patients with HPV-attributed survival benefit. To investigate this heterogeneity, we analysed 307 HNSCC cases (tonsillar, n=135; non-tonsillar, n=172) from eight health care centers mostly from Northern Germany and determined HPV-DNA/mRNA and p16INK4A-status and combined results with the patient outcome. Overall HPV-DNA prevalence rate was 23.5{\%} (72/307); attributed to: 43.7{\%} (59/135) and 7.6{\%} (13/172) tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases, respectively. Among these, 96.6{\%} tonsillar and 38.5{\%} non-tonsillar SCC were HPV-mRNA-positive. Although the study cohort was composed of patients from regions of rather close proximity, prevalence rates showed diversities of up to 40{\%} in HNSCC subsite analysis with the lowest prevalence for tonsillar SCC in metropolitan areas (22.2{\%}) vs. 50.9{\%} in rural areas. Survival analysis identified p16INK4A alone as strongest predictor, followed by HPV-DNA-status alone or in combination with p16INK4A. This survival benefit was shown for tonsillar and non-tonsillar cases. Smoking significantly correlated with HPV-status, however, it does not influence survival when stratified for HPV. In conclusion, the data emphasize the urge for further data on HPV-infection in HNSCC to, e.g. clarify to what extent survival benefits of p16INK4A-positive patients are truly attributed to HPV-infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is prevalent worldwide and causes mucocutaneous infections of the oral area. We aimed to define the frequency and anatomic distribution of HSV-1 reactivation in the facial area in persons with a history of oral herpes. METHODS: Eight immunocompetent HSV-1 seropositive adults were evaluated for shedding of HSV-1 from 12 separate orofacial sites (8 from oral mucosa, 2 from nose, and 2 from conjunctiva) 5 days a week and from the oral cavity 7 days a week for approximately 5 consecutive weeks by a HSV DNA PCR assay. Symptoms and lesions were recorded by participants. RESULTS: Herpes simplex virus type 1 was detected at least from 1 site on 77 (26.5{\%}) of 291 days. The most frequent site of shedding was the oral mucosa, with widespread shedding throughout the oral cavity. Lesional shedding rate was 36.4{\%} (4 of 11 days with lesions), and the asymptomatic rate was 27.1{\%} (65 of 240 nonlesional days). In individual participants, the median rate of HSV shedding by HSV PCR was 19.7{\%} of days (range, 11{\%}-63{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: Reactivation of HSV-1 on the oral mucosa is common and usually asymptomatic. However, HSV-1 is rarely found in tears and nasal mucosa. Frequent oral shedding of HSV-1 may increase the risk for transmitting the virus to both oral and genital mucosa of sexual partners.},

abstract = {Influenza B virus (IBV) causes seasonal epidemics in humans. Although IBV has been isolated from seals, humans are considered the primary host and reservoir of this important pathogen. It is unclear whether other animal species can support the replication of IBV and serve as a reservoir. Swine are naturally infected with both influenza A and C viruses. To determine the susceptibility of pigs to IBV infection, we conducted a serological survey for U.S. Midwest domestic swine herds from 2010 to 2012. Results of this study showed that antibodies to IBVs were detected in 38.5{\%} (20/52) of sampled farms, and 7.3{\%} (41/560) of tested swine serum samples were positive for IBV antibodies. Furthermore, swine herds infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) showed a higher prevalence of IBV antibodies in our 2014 survey. In addition, IBV was detected in 3 nasal swabs collected from PRRSV-seropositive pigs by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing. Finally, an experimental infection in pigs, via intranasal and intratracheal routes, was performed using one representative virus from each of the two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages of IBVs: B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage) and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (Yamagata lineage). Pigs developed influenza-like symptoms and lung lesions, and they seroconverted after virus inoculation. Pigs infected with B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus successfully transmitted the virus to sentinel animals. Taken together, our data demonstrate that pigs are susceptible to IBV infection; therefore, they warrant further surveillance and investigation of swine as a potential host for human IBV. IMPORTANCE: IBV is an important human pathogen, but its ability to infect other species, for example, pigs, is not well understood. We showed serological evidence that antibodies to two genetically and antigenically distinct lineages of IBVs were present among domestic pigs, especially in swine herds previously infected with PRRSV, an immunosuppressive virus. IBV was detected in 3 nasal swabs from PRRSV-seropositive pigs by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Moreover, both lineages of IBV were able to infect pigs under experimental conditions, with transmissibility of influenza B/Victoria lineage virus among pigs being observed. Our results demonstrate that pigs are susceptible to IBV infections, indicating that IBV is a swine pathogen, and swine may serve as a natural reservoir of IBVs. In addition, pigs may serve as a model to study the mechanisms of transmission and pathogenesis of IBVs.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology, viral load and clinical characteristics of WU and KI polyomaviruses. STUDY DESIGN: We tested respiratory specimens collected during a randomized, placebo-controlled pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial and related epidemiological study in the Philippines. We analyzed 1077 nasal washes from patients aged 6 weeks to 5 years who developed lower respiratory tract illness using quantitative real-time PCR for WU and KI. We collected data regarding presenting symptoms, signs, radiographic findings, laboratory data and coinfection. RESULTS: The prevalence and co-infection rates for WU were 5.3{\%} and 74{\%} respectively and 4.2{\%} and 84{\%} respectively for KI. Higher KI viral loads were observed in patients with severe or very severe pneumonia, those presenting with chest indrawing, hypoxia without wheeze, convulsions, and with KI monoinfection compared with co-infection. There was no significant association between viral load and clinical presentation for WU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential pathogenic role for KI, and that there is an association between KI viral load and illness severity.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) was recently identified as a risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) independent of tobacco and alcohol use. The prognosis of patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal carcinomas is better than that for patients with non-HPV-related cancers. Researchers and clinicians can test for HPV infection in cancer by (1) testing directly for HPV DNA and (2) testing for overexpression of the downstream p16 protein; there is currently no consensus regarding which is the better test. The chances of developing a reliable oropharyngeal HPV screening test for high-risk populations are promising. Such a test would allow for secondary prevention by identifying individuals with precursor or early-stage cancerous lesions that are more amenable to treatment. HPV testing has particular significance in SCC of an unknown primary site in head and neck cancer. Successful HPV testing of nodal metastasis can localize cancer specifically to the oropharynx. The optimal evaluation for SCC of an unknown primary in the head and neck has yet to be determined. Some studies have shown that the tonsillar fossa is the most probable primary site, followed closely by the base of the tongue. Biopsies often miss tonsillar carcinoma in the deep crypts of the lymph tissue, as well as in those rare cases in which the primary tumor is located contralateral to the metastatic lymph node. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reports of diagnosed synchronous bilateral HPV-related tonsillar carcinomas. This increase has profound implications for the surgical approach of SCC of an unknown primary site in the head and neck and in tonsillar carcinoma, and it supports the need for bilateral tonsillectomy. We present 2 cases of incidentally discovered synchronous bilateral tonsillar carcinoma, and we review the literature.},

Within the cohort, 45 patients reported a history of tobacco use, with a median intensity of 40 pack-years. In addition, 39 patients (76{\%}) reported moderate to heavy alcohol use. At baseline, there were no statistically significant differences between the two cohorts in sex, median age, cancer stage, intensity of smoking history, and alcohol use (p {\textgreater} 0.05 for all). Radiation doses ranged from 40 to 70 Gy (median: 70). Follow-up ranged from 2 to 93 months (median: 29). After treatment, we found no difference between the S/RT group and the CRT group in the incidence of locoregional recurrence (36 vs. 24{\%}; p = 0.43) or distant metastases (14 vs. 21{\%}; p = 0.56). Likewise, the difference in 2-year estimates of progression-free survival in the two groups was not significant (66 vs. 62{\%}; p = 0.64), nor was the difference in 2-year overall survival (75 vs. 76{\%}; p = 0.83). We conclude that treatment with either (1) primary surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or (2) CRT for locally advanced HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer results in similar outcomes. In view of the relatively poor prognosis for patients with HPV-negative disease compared with their HPV-positive counterparts, clinical trials to investigate intensifying treatment may be warranted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRV) cause a wide spectrum of disease, ranging from a mild influenza-like illness (ILI) to severe respiratory infection. Molecular epidemiological data are limited for HRV circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: To identify the species and genotypes of HRV from clinical samples collected in Sydney, Australia, from 2006 to 2009. METHODS: Combined nose and throat swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from individuals with ILI were tested for HRV using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing data of 5'UTR and VP4/VP2 coding regions on RT-PCR-positive specimens were analysed. RESULTS: Human rhinoviruses were detected by real-time PCR in 20.9{\%} (116/555) of samples tested. Phylogenetic analysis of 5'UTR and VP4/VP2 on HRV-positive samples was concordant in the grouping of HRV A and B species but not HRV C species. Eighty per cent (16/20) of sequences that grouped as HRV C in the VP4/VP2 tree clustered as HRV A, alongside some previously described C strains as subspecies C/A. Discordant branching was seen within HRV A group: two sequences clustering as A in the VP4/VP2 tree branched within the C/A subspecies in the 5'UTR tree, and one sequence showed identity to different HRV A strains in the two genes. The prevalence of HRV C and C/A species was greater in paediatric compared to adult patients (47.9{\%} vs 25.5{\%}, P = .032). CONCLUSION: Human rhinoviruses are a common cause of respiratory infections, and HRV C is present in the Southern Hemisphere. Sequencing of multiple HRV regions may be necessary to determine exact phylogenetic relationships.},

abstract = {Seneca Valley virus (SVV) is the causative agent of an emerging vesicular disease in swine, which is clinically indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease. In addition, SVV has been associated with neonatal mortality in piglets. While a commercial SVV qRT-PCR is available, commercial antibodies are lacking to diagnose SVV infections by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Thus, a novel in situ hybridization technique-RNAscope (ISH) was developed to detect SVVRNA in infected tissues. From a total of 78 samples evaluated, 30 were positive by qRT-PCR and ISH-RNA, including vesicular lesions of affected sows, ulcerative lesions in the tongue of piglets and various other tissues with no evidence of histological lesions. Nineteen samples were negative for SVV by qRT-PCR and ISH-RNA. The Ct values of the qRT-PCR from ISH-RNA positive tissues varied from 12.0 to 32.6 (5.12 x 106 to 5.31 RNA copies/g, respectively). The ISH-RNA technique is an important tool in diagnosing and investigating the pathogenesis of SVV and other emerging pathogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 protein is a transcriptional repressor of the oncogenes E6/E7 and loss of E2 function is considered a key step in carcinogenesis. Integration of HPV into the host genome may disrupt the E2 gene. Furthermore, methylation of CpG dinucleotides in E2-binding sites (E2BSs) in the HPV upstream regulatory region may interfere with transcriptional repression of E6 and E7 by E2. The authors hypothesized that the CpG methylation status of E2BS identifies subtypes of HPV type 16 (HPV16)-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers (OPSCC) in association with E2 gene integrity and viral integration. METHODS: Methylation of 10 CpG dinucleotides within the upstream regulatory region, encompassing E2BSs 1, 2, 3, and 4, was quantitatively analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing in 57 HPV16-associated OPSCC cases. E2 status was analyzed by gene amplification and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Viral integration was determined by integration-specific polymerase chain reaction methods. RESULTS: Three subgroups with differential methylation at E2BS3 and E2BS 4 were identified: 1) complete methylation ({\textgreater}80{\%}) associated with the presence of integrated HPV genomes with an intact E2 gene; 2) intermediate methylation levels (20{\%}-80{\%}) with predominantly episomal HPV genomes with intact E2; and 3) no methylation ({\textless}20{\%}) with a disrupted E2 gene. Patients with high methylation levels tended to have a worse 5-year overall survival compared with patients with intermediate methylation (hazard ratio, 3.23; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.13-9.24 [P = .06]). CONCLUSIONS: Methylation of E2BS3 and E2BS4 in OPSCC is associated with E2 integrity and viral physical status. It might explain deregulated viral oncogene expression in the presence of E2. The prognostic significance of E2BS methylation for patients with HPV-associated OPSCC needs to be analyzed further.},

abstract = {Exchange of gene segments through reassortment is a major feature of influenza A virus evolution and frequently contributes to the emergence of novel epidemic, pandemic, and zoonotic strains. It has long been evident that viral diversification through reassortment is constrained by genetic incompatibility between divergent parental viruses. In contrast, the role of virus-extrinsic factors in determining the likelihood of reassortment has remained unclear. To evaluate the impact of such factors in the absence of confounding effects of segment mismatch, we previously reported an approach in which reassortment between wild-type (wt) and genetically tagged variant (var) viruses of the same strain is measured. Here, using wt/var systems in the A/Netherlands/602/2009 (pH1N1) and A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) strain backgrounds, we tested whether inoculation of parental viruses into distinct sites within the respiratory tract limits their reassortment. Using a ferret (Mustella putorius furo) model, either matched parental viruses were coinoculated intranasally or one virus was instilled intranasally whereas the second was instilled intratracheally. Dual intranasal inoculation resulted in robust reassortment for wt/var viruses of both strain backgrounds. In contrast, when infections were initiated simultaneously at distinct sites, strong compartmentalization of viral replication was observed and minimal reassortment was detected. The observed lack of viral spread between upper and lower respiratory tract tissues may be attributable to localized exclusion of superinfection within the host, mediated by innate immune responses. Our findings indicate that dual infections in nature are more likely to result in reassortment if viruses are seeded into similar anatomical locations and have matched tissue tropisms.IMPORTANCE Genetic exchange between influenza A viruses (IAVs) through reassortment can facilitate the emergence of antigenically drifted seasonal strains and plays a prominent role in the development of pandemics. Typical human influenza infections are concentrated in the upper respiratory tract; however, lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection is an important feature of severe cases, which are more common in the very young, the elderly, and individuals with underlying conditions. In addition to host factors, viral characteristics and mode of transmission can also increase the likelihood of LRT infection: certain zoonotic IAVs are thought to favor the LRT, and transmission via small droplets allows direct seeding into lower respiratory tract tissues. To gauge the likelihood of reassortment in coinfected hosts, we assessed the extent to which initiation of infection at distinct respiratory tract sites impacts reassortment frequency. Our results reveal that spatially distinct inoculations result in anatomical compartmentalization of infection, which in turn strongly limits reassortment.},

abstract = {A novel adenovirus, CeAdV1, was isolated from buffy coat and nasal swab samples collected from two captive white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns. The isolation was an incidental finding in the course of screening animals for use in a research study on an unrelated pathogen. In the screening process, virus isolation was performed on both nasal swabs and buffy coat samples and cytopathic effect was observed. Electron microscopy revealed viral particles with the shape and morphology of an adenovirus. Next generation sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis classified this virus to the Mastadenovirus genus. Its sequence was genetically distinct from all other recognized species in this genus, with only 76{\%} sequence identity to its closest genetic match, bovine adenovirus 3 (BAdV3). The virus could be propagated in bovine derived cells but grew to a higher titer in cervid derived cells. Inoculation of white-tailed deer fawns with the isolated virus resulted in pyrexia, depletion of thymus tissue and mild respiratory disease. Comparative serology performed using convalescent sera revealed distinct antigenic differences between the novel cervid adenovirus and BAdV3. A retrospective serological survey of the captive deer herd indicated that this virus had been circulating in the herd for at least 14 years with no report of clinical disease. A survey of serum collected from free ranging mule deer residing in Nevada revealed high serum titers against this novel adenovirus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to be associated with a number of conditions including cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal neoplasias and cancers, oropharynx cancers and genitals warts (GW). Two prophylactic vaccines are currently available: a bivalent vaccine designed to prevent HPV type 16 and 18 infection and a quadrivalent vaccine targeting HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. In France, HPV vaccination is recommended in 11-14 year-old girls with a catch-up for girls aged 15-19. The objective of this study was to assess the potential impact of an HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 nonavalent vaccine on anogenital and oropharyngeal HPV-related diseases in France. METHODS: HPV genotype distributions from 6 multicentric retrospective studies (EDiTH I to VI) were analyzed including 516 cases of invasive cervical cancers (ICC), 493 high-grade cervical neoplasias (CIN2/3), 397 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 423 GW, 366 anal cancer and 314 oropharyngeal carcinomas. Low and high estimates of HPV vaccine impact were calculated as follows: low estimate: prevalence of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 genotypes alone or in association but excluding presence of another HPV type; high estimate: prevalence of HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 genotypes alone or in association, possibly in presence of another HPV type. RESULTS: Estimates of potential impact varied from 85{\%} (low estimate) to 92{\%} (high estimate) for ICC, 77{\%} to 90{\%} for CIN2/3, 26{\%} to 56{\%} for LSIL, 69{\%} to 90{\%} for GW, 81{\%} to 93{\%} for anal cancer, and 41{\%} to 44{\%} for oropharyngeal carcinomas. Compared to the quadrivalent vaccine, the proportion of additional cases potentially prevented by the nonavalent vaccine was 9.9{\%}-15.3{\%} for ICC, 24.7{\%}-33.3{\%} for CIN2/3, 12.3{\%}-22.7{\%} for LSIL, 2.1{\%}-5.4{\%} for GW, 8.5{\%}-10.4{\%} for anal cancer, and 0.0{\%}-1.6{\%} for oropharyngeal carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: The nonavalent HPV vaccine showed significant increased potential impact compared to the HPV 6/11/16/18 quadrivalent vaccine for ICC, CIN2/3 and LSIL. Considering a 100{\%} vaccine efficacy and high vaccine coverage, about 90{\%} of ICC, CIN2/3, GW or anal cancer cases could be prevented by a nonavalent HPV vaccine in France.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus among poultry and humans has raised global concerns and has motivated government and public health organizations to initiate interventions to prevent the transmission of HPAI. In Bangladesh, H5N1 became endemic in poultry and seven human H5N1 cases have been reported since 2007, including one fatality. This study piloted messages to increase awareness about avian influenza and its prevention in two rural communities, and explored change in villagers' awareness and behaviors attributable to the intervention. METHODS: During 2009-10, a research team implemented the study in two rural villages in two districts of Bangladesh. The team used a focused ethnographic approach for data collection, including informal interviews and observations to provide detailed contextual information about community response to a newly emerging disease. They collected pre-intervention qualitative data for one month. Then another team disseminated preventive messages focused on safe slaughtering methods, through courtyard meetings and affixed posters in every household. After dissemination, the research team collected post-intervention data for one month. RESULTS: More villagers reported hearing about 'bird flu' after the intervention compared to before the intervention. After the intervention, villagers commonly recalled changes in the color of combs and shanks of poultry as signs of avian influenza, and perceived zoonotic transmission of avian influenza through direct contact and through inhalation. Consequently the villagers valued covering the nose and mouth while handling sick and dead poultry as a preventive measure. Nevertheless, the team did not observe noticeable change in villagers' behavior after the intervention. Villagers reported not following the recommended behaviors because of the perceived absence of avian influenza in their flocks, low risk of avian influenza, cost, inconvenience, personal discomfort, fear of being rebuked or ridiculed, and doubt about the necessity of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The villagers' awareness about avian influenza improved after the intervention, however, the intervention did not result in any measurable improvement in preventive behaviors. Low cost approaches that promote financial benefits and minimize personal discomfort should be developed and piloted.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks can occur among passengers and crews during the Alaska summertime cruise season. Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013-2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2-3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83{\%} tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71{\%} tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.},

abstract = {The study of influenza type A (IA) infections in wild mammals populations is a critical gap in our knowledge of how IA viruses evolve in novel hosts that could be in close contact with avian reservoir species and other wild animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility to infection, the nasal shedding and the transmissibility of the H7N1 and H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a wild rodent common throughout Europe and Asia. Two out of 24 H5N1-infected voles displayed evident respiratory distress, while H7N1-infected voles remained asymptomatic. Viable virus was isolated from nasal washes collected from animals infected with both HPAI viruses, and extra-pulmonary infection was confirmed in both experimental groups. Histopathological lesions were evident in the respiratory tract of infected animals, although immunohistochemistry positivity was only detected in lungs and trachea of two H7N1-infected voles. Both HPAI viruses were transmitted by direct contact, and seroconversion was confirmed in 50{\%} and 12.5{\%} of the asymptomatic sentinels in the H7N1 and H5N1 groups, respectively. Interestingly, viable virus was isolated from lungs and nasal washes collected from contact sentinels of both groups. The present study demonstrated that two non-rodent adapted HPAI viruses caused asymptomatic infection in bank voles, which shed high amounts of the viruses and were able to infect contact voles. Further investigations are needed to determine whether bank voles could be involved as silent hosts in the transmission of HPAI viruses to other mammals and domestic poultry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute asthma exacerbations and pneumonia are important causes of morbidity and mortality in children and may coexist in the same children, although symptom overlap may lead to difficulties in diagnosis. Microbial and viral diversity and differential abundance of either may play an important role in infection susceptibility and the development of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. OBJECTIVES: To describe the virome and bacteriome present in the upper respiratory tract of hospitalized children with a clinical diagnosis of asthma and pneumonia during an acute exacerbation and an acute respiratory illness ARI episode respectively. METHODS: During the winter seasons of 2013-2014 and 2014-2015, 134 nasopharyngeal swabs samples of children {\textless}15 years of age with ARI hospitalized at a referral hospital for respiratory diseases were selected based on clinical diagnosis of asthma or pneumonia. The virome and bacteriome were characterized using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and in-house bioinformatics analysis pipeline. RESULTS: The Asthma group was represented mainly by RV-C, BoV-1 and RSV-B and the pneumonia group by Bacteriophage EJ-1 and TTMV. TTV was found in both groups with a similar amount of reads. About bacterial composition Moraxella catarrhalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Acinetobacter were present in asthma and Veillonella parvula and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were mostly found with both asthma and pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a complex viral and bacterial composition in asthma and pneumonia groups with a strong association of RV-C presence in asthmatic children. We observed Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae concurrently in both groups.},

abstract = {The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as an etiologic and transformational agent in inverted Schneiderian papilloma (ISP) is unclear. Indeed, reported detection rates of HPV in ISPs range from 0 to 100{\%}. The true incidence has been confounded by a tendency to conflate high- and low-risk HPV types and by the inability to discern biologically relevant from irrelevant HPV infections. The recent development of RNA in situ hybridization for high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA now allows the direct visualization of transcriptionally active high-risk HPV in ISP, providing an opportunity to more definitively assess its role in the development and progression of ISPs. We performed p16 immunohistochemistry and high-risk HPV RNA in situ hybridization on 30 benign ISPs, 7 ISPs with dysplasia, 16 ISPs with carcinomatous transformation, and 7 non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) with inverted growth that were unassociated with ISP. Transcriptionally active HPV was not detected in any of the 52 ISPs including those that had undergone carcinomatous transformation, but it was detected in two of seven (29{\%}) non-keratinizing SCCs that showed inverted growth. There was a strong correlation between high-risk HPV RNA in situ hybridization and p16 immunohistochemistry (97{\%}; p {\textless} 0.01). These results indicate that transcriptionally active high-risk HPV does not play a common role in either the development of ISP or in its transformation into carcinoma.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses can cause severe life threatening infections in high-risk patients, including young children, the elderly and patients with compromised immunity due to underlying medical conditions or immunosuppressive treatment. The impaired immunity of these patients causes prolonged virus infection and combined with antiviral treatment facilitates the emergence of viruses with resistance mutations. The diverse nature of their immune status makes them a challenging group to study the impact of influenza virus infection and the efficacy of antiviral therapy. Immunocompromised ferrets may represent a suitable animal model to assess influenza virus infection and antiviral treatment strategies in immunocompromised hosts. Here, ferrets were given a daily oral solution of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and prednisolone sodium phosphate to suppress their immune system. Groups of immunocompromised and immunocompetent ferrets were inoculated with an A/H3N2 influenza virus and were subsequently treated with Oseltamivir or left untreated. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on the throat and nose specimens to study virus replication during the course of infection. All immunocompromised ferrets had prolonged presence of viral RNA and a higher total amount of virus shedding compared to the immunocompetent ferrets. Although Oseltamivir reduced the total amount of virus shedding from the nose and throat of treated ferrets, it also resulted in the emergence of the neuraminidase R292K resistance substitution in all these animals, as determined by mutation specific RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. No additional mutations that could be associated with the emergence of the R292K resistance mutation were detected. The immunocompromised ferret model can be used to study A/H3N2 virus shedding and is a promising model to study new antiviral strategies and the emergence of antiviral resistance in immunocompromised hosts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza causes substantial morbidity in children worldwide, although influenza vaccine is seldom used in low-resource settings. More information on the clinical presentation of influenza and the efficacy of vaccine is needed to inform policy. METHODS: In 2013 we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in children aged 24-59 months in Bangladesh (N = 1761). If participants met prespecified specimen collection criteria, we collected nasopharyngeal washes for testing by singleplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection (LCI). A panel of RT-PCR assays was used to detect noninfluenza respiratory viruses. Primary efficacy results have been reported. In this analysis of prespecified and post hoc objectives from the trial, we compared signs and symptoms between LCI and non-LCI cases and estimated the efficacy of LAIV against moderate-to-severe LCI and other prespecified non-LCI clinical outcomes including all-cause pneumonia and acute otitis media. RESULTS: The most common signs and symptoms of LCI were fever, cough, and runny nose. The combination of subjective fever and cough had a 63{\%} sensitivity for LCI. The combination of measured fever, cough, and runny nose was most specific (90{\%}) but had low sensitivity (32{\%}) for LCI. The efficacy of LAIV against vaccine-strain moderate-to-severe LCI was 56.7{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 9.5{\%}-79.2{\%}). No statistically significant vaccine efficacy was found against the non-laboratory-confirmed clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: It was not possible to distinguish LCI from noninfluenza viral infections on clinical evaluations alone in this population of Bangladeshi children. LAIV was efficacious against moderate-to-severe LCI. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01797029.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of viruses in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is poorly understood. In part, this is secondary to difficulty in isolating viruses. Although traditional detection methods for respiratory viruses have had little clinical utility, modern viral screening techniques that use molecular sequencing are now both rapid and feasible, which makes analysis of the paranasal sinus microbiome more accessible. OBJECTIVE: To detect respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CRS and of healthy controls as well as to correlate clinical and radiographic measures of CRS with viral presence. METHODS: In this prospective study, 13 patients with CRS with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and 8 patients without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) were enrolled and compared with 14 healthy controls. Samples were obtained from the paranasal sinuses and were screened for viral DNA with polymerase chain reaction--based sequencing techniques. Typical symptoms of CRS, the Sinonasal Questionnaire, and objective measures, including the modified Lund-Mackay and modified Lund-Kennedy scores were obtained. RESULTS: Eighty percent of the positive screens (4/5) were found in patients with CRSsNP, whereas 20{\%} of the positive tests (1/5) were in the CRSwNP group, and none of the controls tested positive (p = 0.0029). Coronavirus was the most common virus detected. Sinonasal Questionnaire scores of the patients with CRS who tested positive for viruses were higher but not statistically different than those without a positive screen (p = 0.31). Radiographic and endoscopic measures of disease were not significantly different in the setting of a positive viral screen (p = 0.12 and 0.11 respectively). CONCLUSION: Although traditionally difficult, advances in molecular sequencing enhance detection of viruses in the sinonasal tract. In this study, respiratory viruses were more commonly isolated from patients with CRS compared with healthy controls. Moreover, viral infection may play a greater role in symptom exacerbation in CRSsNP than in CRSwNP. These findings warrant further investigation into the role of the viral microbiome in CRS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary colonization with antibiotic-resistant organisms in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is often preceded by upper-airway infections. Although there is a well-described relationship between pulmonary respiratory viral infections and overall disease progression of CF, the pathogenicity of respiratory viral infections in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF remains unknown. With recent advances in respiratory virus detection techniques, this study sought to detect the presence of respiratory viruses in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF in comparison with healthy controls and to correlate the viral presence with clinical measures of sinonasal disease. METHODS: This prospective individual cohort study compared 24 patients with CF with 14 healthy controls. Basic demographics, clinical measures of disease and respiratory viral screens (commercial multiplex) obtained directly from the paranasal sinuses were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in 33{\%} of patients with CF (8/24) compared with 0{\%} of the healthy controls (0/14) (p = 0.017). Respiratory viruses were only detected during the winter months, and the most commonly identified were influenza A and human rhinovirus strains. There was no statistical difference in the 22-Item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) scores (p = 0.93) or modified Lund-Kennedy scores (p = 0.74) between patients with CF with a positive viral test and those without a positive result. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viral detection is more commonly detected in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CF compared with healthy controls. Although respiratory viral presence did not correlate with a worse clinical severity of sinonasal disease, these findings may provide insight into the pathophysiology of CF and open new avenues for potential targeted therapy.},

abstract = {We recently demonstrated how various enveloped viruses can be efficiently concentrated using magnetic beads coated with an anionic polymer, poly(methyl vinyl ether-maleic anhydrate). However, the exact mechanism of interaction between the virus particles and anionic beads remains unclear. To further investigate whether these magnetic anionic beads specifically bind to the viral envelope, we examined their potential interaction with a nonenveloped virus (adenovirus). The beads were incubated with either adenovirus-infected cell culture medium or nasal aspirates from adenovirus-infected individuals and then separated from the supernatant by applying a magnetic field. After thoroughly washing the beads, adsorption of adenovirus was confirmed by a variety of techniques, including immunochromatography, polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and cell culture infection assays. These detection methods positively identified the hexon and penton capsid proteins of adenovirus along with the viral genome on the magnetic beads. Furthermore, various types of adenovirus including Types 5, 6, 11, 19, and 41 were captured using the magnetic bead procedure. Our bead capture method was also found to increase the sensitivity of viral detection. Adenovirus below the detectable limit for immunochromatography was efficiently concentrated using the magnetic bead procedure, allowing the virus to be successfully detected using this methodology. Moreover, these findings clearly demonstrate that a viral envelope is not required for binding to the anionic magnetic beads. Taken together, our results show that this capture procedure increases the sensitivity of detection of adenovirus and would, therefore, be a valuable tool for analyzing both clinical and experimental samples.},

abstract = {We evaluated cross-reactivity of immunoglobulin A (IgA) secreted on the nasal mucosa in mice that were nasally inoculated 4 times with a mixture of inactivated H1N1 influenza A viruses and poly(N-vinylacetamide-co-acrylic acid) (PNVA-co-AA) bearing d-octaarginine at 7-day intervals. Three viral strains (A/Puerto Rico/8/34, A/New Caledonia/20/99 IVR116, and A/Solomon Islands/03/2006) and D-octaarginine-linked polymers with different molecular weights were used as antigens and their carriers, respectively. Secretion of intranasal IgA was barely observed when the inactivated virus alone was administered. The polymer induced the production of intranasal IgA specific to the inoculated viruses, irrespective of the viral strain and molecular weight of the polymer. The respective antibodies cross-reacted to recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of not only the viral strain used for immunization but also other H1N1 strains, including A/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain whose hemagglutinin proteins are diverse from those of other strains. Mice with high reactivity of IgA to the inoculated viruses tended to acquire clear cross-reactivity to other viral strains. Notably, IgA induced by inactivated H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/99 IVR116 strain with the strongest immunogenicity between 3 antigens in the presence of the polymer cross-reacted to recombinant hemagglutinin proteins of the A/Brisbane/10/2007 and A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 strains, which are categorized into H3N2 and H5N1, respectively. Our polymer is a potential candidate for an efficient antigen carrier that induces mucosal IgA having cross-reactivity to antigenically drifted variants, irrespective of the subtype of viral strains.},

abstract = {Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) has demonstrated varying levels of efficacy against seasonal influenza; however, LAIV may be used as a tool to measure interactions between the human microbiome and a live, replicating virus. To increase our knowledge of this interaction, we measured changes to the nasal microbiome in subjects who received LAIV to determine if associations between influenza-specific IgA production and the nasal microbiome exist after immunization with a live virus vaccine. The anterior nares of 47 healthy subjects were swabbed pre- (Day 0) and post- (Days 7 and 28) LAIV administration, and nasal washes were conducted on Days 0 and 28. We performed next-generation sequencing on amplified 16s rRNA genes and measured mucosal influenza-specific IgA titers via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A significant increase in alpha diversity was identified (Observed, CHAO, and ACE) between Days 7 vs 0 (p-values = 0.017, 0.005, 0.005, respectively) and between Days 28 vs 0 (p-values = 0.054, 0.030, 0.050, respectively). Several significant associations between the presence of different microbial species, including Lactobacillus helveticus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus infantis, Veillonella dispar, and Bacteroides ovatus, and influenza-specific H1 and H3 IgA antibody response were demonstrated. These data suggest that LAIV alters the nasal microbiome, allowing several less-abundant OTUs to establish a community niche. Additionally, specific alterations in the nasal microbiome are significantly associated with variations in influenza-specific IgA antibody production and could be clinically relevant.},

Study Design Retrospective case series with chart review of ear, nose, and throat oncologic database. Setting Academic tertiary care hospital. Subjects A total of 123 samples of larynx squamous cell carcinoma were included, only from the glottis and treated only with surgery between 1977 and 2005. Methods DNA extraction was carried out by polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent visualization was performed in low-density arrays. Results were compared with histologic, clinicopathologic, and survival parameters, with a 10-year follow-up. Results HPV DNA was detected in 22.76{\%} (n = 28) of the samples. Eleven genotypes were detected, 2 of which had never been described in the larynx (HPV43 and HPV62). No increasing trend of HPV was observed over time. HPV presence did not correlate with better survival during the follow-up. Smoking was proven as an independent factor in relation to the presence of HPV. Conclusion HPV may represent a notable factor in the development of a subset of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma without significant influence on overall and disease-free survival. More studies, including oncogene transcription proteins, would be necessary to draw more relevant conclusions about the relevance of HPV infection in the larynx.},

MRI demonstrated lesions in the white matter involving the left parietal lobe, accompanied by speckled or faint linear peripheral enhancement. Brain biopsy revealed JC virus infection in oligodendrocytes and balanced infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes. We diagnosed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with controlled inflammation. The finding of CD4/CD8 T cells in the infected PML brain suggested therapeutically valuable immune system involvement, which we decided to preserve by withholding corticosteroids. We treated the patient with risperidone, cytarabine and mefloquine to suppress virus replication, but not with the corticosteroid that is conventionally used in inflammatory PML cases. The patient was discharged three months after admission, and one year later, his score on the Mini-Mental State Examination had recovered to 26/30, from 5/30 on admission.},

abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes serious upper and lower respiratory tract infections in newborns and infants. Presently, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV. We previously reported the safety and efficacy of a novel vaccine candidate ($\Delta$F/TriAdj) in rodent and lamb models following intranasal immunization. However, the effects of the vaccine on the innate immune system in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, when delivered intranasally, have not been characterized. In the present study, we found that $\Delta$F/TriAdj triggered transient production of chemokines, cytokines and interferons in the nasal tissues and lungs of BALB/c mice. The types of chemokines produced were consistent with the populations of immune cells recruited, i.e. dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils, in the nose-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), lung and their draining lymph nodes of the $\Delta$F/TriAdj-immunized group. In addition, $\Delta$F/TriAdj stimulated cellular activation with generation of mucosal and systemic antibody responses, and conferred complete protection from viral infection in the lungs upon RSV challenge. The effect of $\Delta$F/TriAdj was short-lived in the nasal tissues and more prolonged in the lungs. In addition, both innate and adaptive immune responses were lower when mice were immunized with $\Delta$F alone. These results suggest that $\Delta$F/TriAdj modulates the innate mucosal environment in both upper and lower respiratory tracts, which contributes to robust adaptive immune responses and long-term protective efficacy of this novel vaccine formulation.},

We describe the ages and nature of fVDEs in an infant birth cohort and explore factors associated with increased odds of symptomatic fVDEs. METHODS: The Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID) study is a community-based birth cohort describing acute respiratory infections in infants until their second birthday. Parents recorded daily symptoms and collected nose swabs weekly, which were batch-tested using polymerase chain reaction assays for 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-eight infants participated in ORChID. The median age for fVDEs was 2.9 months for human rhinovirus (HRV) but was ≥13.9 months for other respiratory viruses. Overall, 52{\%} of HRV fVDEs were symptomatic, compared with 57{\%}-83{\%} of other fVDEs. Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus fVDEs were more severe than HRV fVDEs. Older age and the winter season were associated with symptomatic episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Infants do not always experience respiratory symptoms with their fVDE. Predominance of early HRV detections highlights the need for timing any intervention early in life. fVDEs from other respiratory viruses most commonly occur when maternal vaccines may no longer provide protection.},

Intranasal administration of Adex1CAICOSIg attenuated airway inflammation, as demonstrated by a decrease in nasal symptoms and infiltration of eosinophils into the nasal mucosa, as well as by a decrease in local IL-5 expression. Therefore, the ICOS/ICOSL pathway significantly contributes to the progression of allergic rhinitis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because influenza virus isolates after cell culture are required to determine their susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors, the differences in normal or low-susceptibility variant population frequencies between clinical samples and isolates have not been considered. OBJECTIVES: To identify variations in low-susceptibility populations in clinical samples after initiation of oseltamivir and zanamivir therapy by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). STUDY DESIGN: We measured the populations of the low-susceptibility influenza A H3N2 variants E119V and R292K by qRT-PCR using 305 nasal aspiration samples collected over time from 13, 16, and 11 patients treated with no neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, respectively. The variant population in the isolates was also determined when the population of low-susceptibility variants in the clinical samples increased following treatment. Moreover, the susceptibility of all isolates was measured. RESULTS: The E119V variant was detected in only one patient during oseltamivir therapy, exhibiting decreased susceptibility to oseltamivir. Prior to treatment, R292K variants were detected in all clinical samples; however, they comprised only a small fraction of the total population. The proportion of the R292K variant in clinical samples increased for 6/27 (22.2{\%}) patients treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, whereas an increase in the proportion of the R292K variant in virus isolates was observed in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS: Discrepancies in the proportion of R292K variants between clinical samples and isolates should be suspected in clinical settings. qRT-PCR is useful for quantitative analysis of drug-resistant influenza virus and for immediate notification of the result.},

The present study aimed to detect various respiratory viruses and bacteria in middle ear fluid (MEF) and nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). METHODS: We collected MEF and NPA samples from 122 pediatric patients with AOM. Real-time PCR detected 11 types of respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus A/B, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus A/B, adenovirus, human bocavirus and rhino virus) and 7 types of bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Legionella pneumophila and Moraxella catarrhalis). MEF specimens were also examined using bacterial culture. RESULTS: At least 1 respiratory viral or bacterial pathogen was detected in MEF of 120 cases (98{\%}) by viral and bacterial PCR and of 93 cases (76{\%}) by viral PCR and bacterial culture. Respiratory viruses were detected in NPA of 84 cases (69{\%}) and MEF of 67 cases (55{\%}). The most common virus detected in MEF was respiratory syncytial virus (21{\%}), followed by parainfluenza virus (15{\%}). All the viruses present in MEF were also detected in NPA specimens. Bacteria were detected by PCR in MEF of 109 cases (89{\%}); H. influenzae was the most frequently detected (65{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In many cases, pediatric AOM was found to constitute a respiratory polymicrobial infection. Multiplex PCR was useful to detect multiple respiratory viruses and bacteria in AOM. To understand intractable AOM, further studies regarding the clinical features of each viral and bacterial coinfection are required.},

abstract = {Experimental intranasal infection of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with calpox virus results in fatal disease. Route and dose used for viral inoculation of the test animals mimics the natural transmission of smallpox, thus representing a suitable model to study pathogenesis and to evaluate new vaccines against orthopoxvirus infection. However, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to death are still unclear. Therefore, our study aimed at investigating the kinetics of pathological alterations to clarify the pathogenesis in calpox virus infection. Following intranasal inoculation with two different viral doses, common marmosets were sacrificed on days 3, 5, 7, 10 and 12 post inoculation. Collected tissue was screened using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy, and virological assays. Our data suggest that primary replication took place in nasal and bronchial epithelia followed by secondary replication in submandibular lymph nodes and spleen. Parallel to viremia at day 7, virus was detectable in many organs, mainly located in epithelial cells and macrophages, as well as in endothelial cells. Based on the onset of clinical signs, the histological and ultrastructural lesions and the immunohistochemical distribution pattern of the virus, the incubation period was defined to last 11 days, which resembles human smallpox. In conclusion, the data indicate that the calpox model is highly suitable for studying orthopoxvirus-induced disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This investigation focused on histological characteristics and 5-year implant survival after sinus floor augmentation with anorganic bovine bone (ABB, Bio-Oss) and ABB plus autologous bone (AB) with a ratio of 1/1. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nineteen consecutive patients with bony atrophy of the posterior edentulous maxilla and a vertical bone height ≤4 mm were prospectively included in this study. In the first surgical stage, the maxillary sinus was non-randomized either augmented with ABB alone (n = 12) or a 1/1 mixture of ABB and AB (n = 7). After a mean healing period of 167 days, biopsies were harvested in the region of the grafted sinus with a trephine burr and implants were placed simultaneously, ABB n = 18 and ABB + AB n = 12. The samples were microradiographically and histomorphometrically analyzed judging the newly formed bone (bone volume, BV), residual bone substitute material volume (BSMV), and intertrabecular volume (soft tissue volume, ITV) in the region of the augmented maxillary sinus. Implant survival was retrospectively evaluated from patient's records. RESULTS: No significant difference in residual bone substitute material (BSMV) in the ABB group (31.21 ± 7.74{\%}) and the group with the mixture of ABB and AB (28.41 ± 8.43{\%}) was histomorphologically determined. Concerning the de novo bone formation, also both groups showed statistically insignificant outcomes; ABB 26.02 ± 5.23{\%} and ABB + AB 27.50 ± 6.31{\%}. In all cases, implants were installed in the augmented sites with sufficient primary stability. After a mean time in function of 5 years and 2 months, implant survival was 93.75{\%} in the ABB and 92.86{\%} in the ABB + AB group with no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: The usage of ABB plus AB to a 1/1 ratio leads to an amount of newly formed bone comparable with the solitary use of ABB after grafting of the maxillary sinus. Considering that ABB is a non-resorbable bone substitute, it can be hypothesized that this leads to stable bone over time and long-term implant success. Importantly, in the sole use of ABB, bone grafting and therefore donor site morbidities can be avoided.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) induces respiratory infection, abortion, and neurologic disease with significant impact. Virulence factors contributing to infection and immune evasion are of particular interest. A potential virulence factor of the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 is ORF2. This study on 24 Icelandic horses, 2 to 4 years of age, describes the infection with EHV-1 Ab4, or its deletion mutant devoid of ORF2 (Ab4$\Delta$ORF2) compared to non-infected controls (each group n = 8). The horses' clinical presentation, virus shedding, viremia, antibody and cellular immune responses were monitored over 260 days after experimental infection. RESULTS: Infection with Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 reduced fever and minimized nasal virus shedding after infection compared to the parent virus strain Ab4, while Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 established viremia similar to Ab4. Concurrently with virus shedding, intranasal cytokine and interferon $\alpha$ (IFN-$\alpha$) production increased in the Ab4 group, while horses infected with Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 expressed less IFN-$\alpha$. The antibody response to EHV-1 was evaluated by a bead-based multiplex assay and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4$\Delta$ORF2. EHV-1 specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 was induced 8 days after infection (d8 pi) with a peak on d10-12 pi. EHV-1 specific IgG4/7 increased starting on d10 pi, and remained elevated in serum until the end of the study. The intranasal antibody response to EHV-1 was dominated by the same IgG isotypes and remained elevated in both infected groups until d130 pi. In contrast to the distinct antibody response, no induction of EHV-1 specific T-cells was detectable by flow cytometry after ex vivo re-stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with EHV-1 in any group. The cellular immune response was characterized by increased secretion of IFN-$\gamma$ and interleukin10 in response to ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMC with EHV-1. This response was present during the time of viremia (d5-10 pi) and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4$\Delta$ORF2. CONCLUSIONS: ORF2 is a virulence factor of EHV-1 Ab4 with impact on pyrexia and virus shedding from the nasal mucosa. In contrast, ORF2 does not influence viremia. The immunogenicity of the Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 and parent Ab4 viruses are identical. Graphical abstract - Deletion of ORF2 reduces virulence of EHV-1 Ab4. Graphical summary of the main findings of this study: ORF2 is a virulence factor of EHV-1 Ab4 with impact on pyrexia and virus shedding from the nasal mucosa.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV) and Chlamydia felis are involved in feline upper respiratory tract disease (FURTD). Clinical signs caused by these agents can overlap, and the involvement of certain pathogens is often unpredictable. The objectives of this study were to compare detection rates of FHV-1, FCV and C felis at different sampling sites, and to investigate the correlation between positive test results and clinical signs in cats with FURTD. METHODS: Swabs were taken from the nose, pharynx, tongue and conjunctiva of 104 cats with signs of FURTD. Real-time PCR was performed on all samples for the detection of FHV-1, FCV and C felis. RESULTS: Infectious agents were identified in 93 (89.4{\%}) cats. Of these, 55.8{\%} were positive for FHV-1, 50.0{\%} for FCV and 35.6{\%} for C felis. FCV was found more frequently in the oropharynx (92.3{\%} of FCV-positive cats) and on the tongue (90.4{\%}) than the conjunctiva (38.5{\%}) (P {\textless}0.001). There was no significant difference between the four sampling sites for the detection of FHV-1 and C felis. If nasal samples had also been taken, 94.9{\%} of FHV-1-positive cats, 96.2{\%} of FCV-positive cats and 81.1{\%} of C felis-positive cats would have been detected. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The oropharynx can be recommended as the preferred single sampling site for the detection of FCV, FHV-1 and C felis if only one sample can be taken; however, taking samples at different sites significantly increases the detection rate for all pathogens studied. Interestingly, sampling from a site with FURTD-associated lesions did not increase the likelihood of detecting the infectious agents.},

abstract = {We used real-time RT-PCR and virus titration to examine canine distemper virus (CDV) kinetics in peripheral blood and rectal and nasal secretions from 12 experimentally infected dogs. Real-time RT-PCR proved extremely sensitive, and the correlation between the two methods for rectal and nasal (r=0.78, 0.80) samples on the peak day of viral RNA was good. Although the dogs showed diverse symptoms, viral RNA kinetics were similar; the peak of viral RNA in the symptomatic dogs was consistent with the onset of symptoms. These results indicate that real-time RT-PCR is sufficiently sensitive to monitor CDV replication in experimentally infected dogs regardless of the degree of clinical manifestation and suggest that the peak of viral RNA reflects active CDV replication.},

We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) in adult patients, using a test-negative case-control design study based on the results of a rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT). Between November 2016 and March 2017, a total of 1048 adult patients were enrolled: including 363 RIDT positive for influenza A, 9 RIDT-positive for influenza B, and 676 RIDT-negative. During the 2016/17 season, the overall adjusted VE was 28.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 6.3-46{\%}). The adjusted VE against influenza A was 27.4{\%} (95{\%}CI: 4.4-45{\%}). The VE against influenza B could not be estimated because of the very low number of influenza B patients. Twenty-nine patients were hospitalized due to influenza-associated illness-during the present study, all of whom were infected with influenza A virus. The adjusted VE, determined using a case-control study, for preventing hospitalization for influenza A infection was 72.6{\%} (95{\%}CI: 30.7-89.1{\%}). In addition, the VE for preventing hospitalization of influenza patients with comorbidities was 78.2{\%} (95{\%}CI: 41.1-92{\%}). Our study showed that, during the 2016/17season, IIV4 was effective for preventing both the onset of influenza and influenza-associated hospitalization.},

abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important transboundary viral disease of pigs confronting the swine industry worldwide. This study was aimed to assess the pathogenic potential of PRRS virus belonging to genotype 2 that emerged in India in 2013. Nine 6-week-old piglets were inoculated intranasally with 2 × 10(5.75)  TCID(50) /ml of PRRSV (Ind-297221/2013). Three piglets were kept as uninfected controls. Blood and nasal swabs were collected daily up to 7 days post-infection (dpi) and on alternate days subsequently. Piglets were necropsied for tissue sample collection either on death or after euthanasia on 7, 14 or 21 dpi (one uninfected control and three PRRSV-infected piglets per interval). The virus caused high fever, typical blue ear, weight loss, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and leucopenia between 2 and 8 dpi. Two infected piglets died (on 3 and 17 dpi) during the course of study. The presence of virus in serum and nasal secretion was observed up to 19 and 17 dpi, respectively, with the maximum load between 4 and 7 dpi. Seroconversion started 6 dpi and the mean PRRSV antibody titre reached up to 640 by 21 dpi. Virus load was highest in tonsils at all the intervals, whereas in spleen and lymph nodes load was higher in later intervals. Major microscopic lesions in PRRSV-infected piglets included moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid depletion in tonsils and lymph nodes (cystic), thymic atrophy, reactive hyperplasia followed by lymphoid depletion in spleen. PRRSV antigen was consistently demonstrated by immunoperoxidase test in the lungs, spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes. Antigen distribution was more widespread on 7 and 14 dpi than on 21 dpi. The findings establish that the Indian PRRSV is highly pathogenic to piglets.},

It was demonstrated that 50{\%} of the infective dose (ID50) of the MPXV on external clinical signs of the disease was 2.2 Ig plaque forming units (PFU). The percentage of the marmot mortality is slightly dependent on the infecting dose of the MPXV, therefore it is not possible to correctly determine the value of 50 {\%} fatal dose (FD50) for these animals. The most pronounced external clinical signs of the disease were obtained in the marmots: pox-like skin rash throughout the surface of the body and mucous membranes, purulent discharge from the nose, lymphadenitis, discoordination, tremor of the extremities, fever, increased aggression, and ruffled fur. In the course of experiments intended to determine the dynamics of the accumulation of the MPXV in various organs, tissues, and blood serum of marmot infected i/n with dose of 3.7 Ig PFU, it was found that the trachea, lungs, and the bifurcation lymph nodes are the primary target organs. The trachea, lungs, nasal mucosa membrane, and skin are the organs with maximal virus replication recorded at 5, 7, 9, and 12 days after the infection. The transfer of the MPXV into the secondary target organs (nasal mucosa membrane, brain, spleen, duodenum, adrenal glands, and skin) was carried out in marmots with lymphogenic and hematogenic ways of the dissemination of the infection.},

abstract = {The Influenza virus is a leading cause of respiratory disease in the United States each year. While the virus normally causes mild to moderate disease, hospitalization and death can occur in many cases. There are several methodologies that are used for detection; however problems such as decreased sensitivity and high rates of false-negative results may arise. There is a crucial need for an effective sample preparation technology that concentrates viruses at low abundance while excluding resident analytes that may interfere with detection. Nanotrap particles are hydrogel particles that are coupled to chemical dye affinity baits that bind a broad range of proteins and virions. Within minutes ({\textless}30 minutes), Nanotrap particles concentrate low abundant proteins and viruses from clinically complex matrices. Nanotrap particles with reactive red baits concentrated numerous respiratory viruses including various strains and subtypes of Influenza virus, Coronavirus, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus from saliva, nasal fluid swab specimens, and nasal aspirates. Detection was enhanced more than 10-fold when coupled to plaque assays and qRT-PCR. Importantly, Nanotrap particle can efficiently capture and concentrate multiple viral pathogens during a coinfection scenario. These results collectively demonstrate that Nanotrap particles are an important tool that can easily be integrated into various detection methodologies.},

abstract = {Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) enters mice via olfactory epithelial cells and then colonizes the trigeminal ganglia (TG). Most TG nerve endings are subepithelial, so this colonization implies subepithelial viral spread, where myeloid cells provide an important line of defense. The outcome of infection of myeloid cells by HSV-1 in vitro depends on their differentiation state; the outcome in vivo is unknown. Epithelial HSV-1 commonly infected myeloid cells, and Cre-Lox virus marking showed nose and lung infections passing through LysM-positive (LysM(+)) and CD11c(+) cells. In contrast, subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSMs) exposed to lymph-borne HSV-1 were permissive only when type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling was blocked; normally, their infection was suppressed. Thus, the outcome of myeloid cell infection helped to determine the HSV-1 distribution: subepithelial myeloid cells provided a route of spread from the olfactory epithelium to TG neurons, while SSMs blocked systemic spread. IMPORTANCE: Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects most people and can cause severe disease. This reflects its persistence in nerve cells that connect to the mouth, nose, eye, and face. Established infection seems impossible to clear. Therefore, we must understand how it starts. This is difficult in humans, but mice show HSV-1 entry via the nose and then spread to its preferred nerve cells. We show that this spread proceeds in part via myeloid cells, which normally function in host defense. Myeloid infection was productive in some settings but was efficiently suppressed by interferon in others. Therefore, interferon acting on myeloid cells can stop HSV-1 spread, and enhancing this defense offers a way to improve infection control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevention of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) in beef cattle is important to maintaining health and productivity of calves in feeding operations. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether BRD bacterial and viral pathogens are susceptible to the lactoperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/iodide (LPO/H(2) O(2) /I(-) ) system in vitro and to determine whether the oral administration of sodium iodide (NaI) could achieve sufficient concentrations of iodine (I) in the respiratory secretions of weaned beef calves to inactivate these pathogens in vivo. ANIMALS: Sixteen weaned, apparently healthy, commercial beef calves from the University of Missouri, College of Veterinary Medicine teaching herd. METHODS: In vitro viral and bacterial assays were performed to determine susceptibility to the LPO/H(2) O(2) /I(-) system at varying concentrations of NaI. Sixteen randomly selected, healthy crossbred beef weanlings were administered 70 mg/kg NaI, or water, orally in a blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Blood and nasal secretions were collected for 72 hours and analyzed for I(-) concentration. RESULTS: Bovine herpesvirus-1, parainfluenza-3, Mannheimia haemolytica and Bibersteinia trehalosi were all inactivated or inhibited in vitro by the LPO/H(2) O(2) /I(-) reaction. Oral administration of NaI caused a marked increase in nasal fluid I concentration with a C(max)  = 181 (1,420 $\mu$M I), T(12) , a sufficient concentration to inactivate these pathogens in vitro. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: In vitro, the LPO/H(2) O(2) /I(-) system inactivates and inhibits common pathogens associated with BRD. The administration of oral NaI significantly increases the I concentration of nasal fluid indicating that this system might be useful in preventing bovine respiratory infections.},

abstract = {The mammalian inner ear consists of diverse cell types with important functions. Gene mutations in these diverse cell types have been found to underlie different forms of genetic hearing loss. Targeting these mutations for gene therapy development represents a future therapeutic strategy to treat hearing loss. Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have become the vector of choice for gene delivery in animal models in vivo. To identify AAV vectors that target inner ear cell subtypes, we systemically screened 12 AAV vectors with different serotypes (AAV1, 2, 5, 6, 6.2, 7, 8, 9, rh.8, rh.10, rh.39, and rh.43) that carry a reporter gene GFP in neonatal and adult mice by microinjection in vivo. We found that most AAVs infect both neonatal and adult inner ear, with different specificities and expression levels. The inner ear cochlear sensory epithelial region, which includes auditory hair cells and supporting cells, is most frequently targeted for gene delivery. Expression of the transgene is sustained, and neonatal inner ear delivery does not adversely affect hearing. Adult inner ear injection of AAV has a similar infection pattern as the younger inner ear, with the exception that outer hair cell death caused by the injection procedure can lead to hearing loss. In the adult, more so than in the neonatal mice, cell types infected and efficiency of infection are correlated with the site of injection. Most infected cells survive in neonatal and adult inner ears. The study adds to the list of AAV vectors that transduce the mammalian inner ear efficiently, providing the tools that are important to study inner ear gene function and for the development of gene therapy to treat hearing loss.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus C (RV-C) is an important respiratory pathogen of children, but little is known about its contribution to disease severity, though viral load appears to be important. Difficulty in RV-C cultivation and target sequence variation has precluded the development of a PCR based quantification method. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and validate reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays for a broad range of circulating RV-C genotypes in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). STUDY DESIGN: Four assays were designed to quantify a 296bp region located within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of RV-C types. These assays were based on in silico analysis of available RV-C sequences. Probes were designed to provide 100{\%} homology to the corresponding RV-C genotypes. RESULTS: The linear dynamic range of each of the four assays spanned eight orders of magnitude (10(4)-10(11) copies/mL). The limit of detection for assays 1-4 was estimated to be 1147 copies/mL, 765 copies/mL, 1138 copies/mL and 1470 copies/mL respectively. Each assay demonstrated a strong linear relationship (r(2)={\textgreater}0.995) and amplification efficiency greater than 95{\%}. Repeatability and reproducibility of the method were shown to be high, with coefficients of variations lower than 8{\%} and 15{\%} respectively.},

abstract = {Potency tests for commercial oil-adjuvanted foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines are usually carried out in cattle, using a full dose (2 ml) of vaccine and homologous virus challenge. However, in sheep the recommended vaccine dose is half of the cattle dose (1 ml) and most vaccines have not been potency tested for this species, especially with heterologous viruses. To determine the efficacy of a high potency ({\textgreater}6PD(50)) FMD virus (FMDV) O1Manisa vaccine in sheep, we carried out a study using a heterologous FMDV (FMDV O/SKR/2010 - Mya-98 strain) challenge. Groups of seven animals each were vaccinated with 2×, 1×, 1/2× or 1/4× dose (2 ml, 1 ml, 0.5 ml or 0.25 ml respectively) and challenged at 7 days post vaccination (dpv). Only 3 of the 7 sheep in the group vaccinated with 2 ml were protected. With 2 additional groups, receiving double or single doses and challenged at 14 dpv, 4 of 7 sheep were protected in each group. None of the sheep had measurable neutralising antibodies against the vaccine or challenge virus at 7 dpv. However, all vaccinated animals challenged at 14 dpv had a homologous neutralising response against FMDV O1 Manisa on the day of challenge and all but one animal also had a heterologous response to FMDV O/SKR/2010. Infectious FMDV and viral RNA could be found in nasal swabs between 1 and 6 days post challenge (dpc) in most vaccinated sheep, but those vaccinated with higher doses or challenged at 14 dpv showed significant decreases in the level of FMDV detection. Intermittent virus shedding was noticed between 1 and 35 dpc in all vaccinated groups, but persistent infection could be demonstrated only in 4 sheep (20{\%}). This study showed that at the recommended dose, a high potency ({\textgreater}6 PD(50)) FMDV O1Manisa vaccine does not protect sheep against a heterologous challenge at 7 dpv. However, partial protection was observed when a double dose was used at 7 dpv or when double or single dose vaccinated sheep were challenged at 14 dpv.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heated, humidified air has long been used by people with the common cold. The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and that heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding, and nasal resistance. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (to February 2017), MEDLINE (1966 to 24 February 2017), Embase (1990 to 24 February 2017), and Current Contents (1998 to 24 February 2017). We also searched World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (8 March 2017) and ClinicalTrials.gov (8 March 2017) as well as reference lists of included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or experimentally induced common cold were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Three review authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion of potential studies identified from the search. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail to complete a PRISMA flow diagram. We used a data collection form for study characteristics and outcome data that was developed and used for previous versions of this review. Two review authors independently extracted data, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We used Review Manager 5 software to analyse data. MAIN RESULTS: We included six trials from five publications involving a total of 387 participants. We included no new studies in this 2017 update. The 'Risk of bias' assessment suggested an unclear risk of bias in the domain of randomisation and a low risk of bias in performance, detection, attrition, and reporting.It was uncertain whether heated, humidified air provides symptomatic relief for the common cold, as the fixed-effect analysis showed evidence of an effect (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.56; 2 studies, 149 participants), but the random-effects analysis showed no significant difference in the results (OR 0.22, 95{\%} CI 0.03 to 1.95). There is an argument for using either form of analysis. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, but an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding in nasal washings, finding no significant difference between treatment and placebo groups (OR 0.47, 95{\%} CI 0.04 to 5.19). As judged by the subjective response to therapy (i.e. therapy did not help), the number of participants reporting resolution of symptoms was not significantly higher in the heated humidified group (OR 0.58, 95{\%} CI 0.28 to 1.18; 2 studies, 124 participants). There was significant heterogeneity in the effects of heated, humidified air on different outcomes, therefore we graded the quality of the evidence as low. Some studies reported minor adverse events (including discomfort or irritation of the nose). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence does not show any benefits or harms from the use of heated, humidified air delivered via the RhinoTherm device for the treatment of the common cold. There is a need for more double-blind, randomised trials that include standardised treatment modalities.},

abstract = {Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a highly pathogenic tick-borne flavivirus enzootic to India. In humans, KFDV causes a severe febrile disease. In some infected individuals, hemorrhagic manifestations, such as bleeding from the nose and gums and gastrointestinal bleeding with hematemesis and/or blood in the stool, have been reported. However, the mechanisms underlying these hemorrhagic complications remain unknown, and there is no information about the specific target cells for KFDV. We investigated the interaction of KFDV with vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs), which are key targets for several other hemorrhagic viruses. Here, we report that ECs are permissive to KFDV infection, which leads to their activation, as demonstrated by the upregulation of E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 at the mRNA and protein levels. Increased expression of these adhesive molecules correlated with increased leukocyte adhesion. Infected ECs upregulated the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 but not IL-8. Additionally, moDCs were permissive to KFDV infection, leading to increased release of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$. Supernatants from KFDV-infected moDCs caused EC activation, as measured by leukocyte adhesion. The results indicate that ECs and moDCs can be targets for KFDV and that both direct and indirect mechanisms can contribute to EC activation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has a better outcome than most head neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) and an HPV-positive lymph node metastasis likely has an HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC origin. Determining HPV-status in cervical lymph nodes by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) may be useful for diagnosis. METHODS: FNACs from 66 patients with neck masses were prospectively examined for HPV DNA and HPV16 mRNA by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay, and the data correlated to diagnosis and HPV-status obtained from histopathological specimens. RESULTS: Aspirates from 17 of 66 patients, later diagnosed with HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC, were HPV16 DNA-positive. HPV16 mRNA was detected in all cases with extractable RNA. All remaining FNACs, including 18 branchial cleft cysts, were HPV DNA-negative. HPV DNA status in the aspirates showed perfect concordance with corresponding biopsies. CONCLUSION: HPV16 DNA detection in fine-needle aspirations from neck masses is reliable and HPV16 DNA in a metastasis is a strong indicator of an HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recognized as a risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), especially tonsillar and base of tongue cancer. Furthermore, HPV-positive tonsillar and base of tongue SCC have a significantly better prognosis than their HPV-negative counterparts and head and neck cancer (HNSCC) in general. HPV has recently also been implicated in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) in the head and neck region, where a primary tumour is not found despite extensive workup. Using fine-needle aspiration cytology to determine CUP HPV status in cervical lymph nodes could be of advantage, since it is minimally invasive and it is assumed that an HPV-positive lymph node metastasis likely has an HPV-positive otopharyngeal SCC origin. We review the current knowledge of HPV in HNSCC, with an emphasis on CUP of the head and neck region, its relation to oropharyngeal, tonsillar and base of tongue SCC and implications of HPV status for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity emerged as a novel risk factor for severe disease during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Murine studies indicate that obesity is associated with ineffective response to influenza vaccine, but few human studies exist. We aimed to determine if influenza vaccine is protective against laboratory-confirmed influenza in obese children. METHODS: Body mass index, vaccination status, and laboratory-confirmed influenza data were analyzed from a previously conducted prospective study in which active surveillance for influenza-like illness was conducted in 8 elementary schools in Los Angeles County during the 2010-2011 influenza season. Polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) was performed on combined nose/throat swabs collected from children with influenza-like illness at presentation to the school nurse or during absenteeism. RESULTS: Of 4260 children with height/weight data, 1191 (28.0{\%}) were obese (body mass index ≥95th percentile). Respiratory specimens were obtained from 858 (20.1{\%}) children. Unvaccinated obese compared with vaccinated obese children acquired 3 times more PCR-confirmed influenza (62 vs. 17 per 1000 children, P = 0.003) and missed more school days (4.6 vs. 3.2 per 100 school days, P {\textless} 0.001) during influenza season. Obese children with PCR-confirmed influenza were more likely to present with cough (86.2 vs. 72.4{\%}, P = 0.030) and missed more school per episode (2.4 vs.1.9 days, P = 0.023) compared with nonobese children. Among vaccinated children, rates of PCR-confirmed influenza were similar in obese and nonobese children (17 vs. 20 per 1000 children, P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Obese children with PCR-confirmed influenza suffered from more cough and missed more school days than their nonobese peers. Influenza vaccination protected obese children against PCR-proven influenza illness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) needs more reliable biomarkers. The aim of this study was to investigate serum cytokeratin 19 fragment 21.1 (CYFRA21-1) as an NPC biomarker based on data from a large sample. METHODS: From October 2010 to February 2014, 529 subjects were enrolled and divided into three groups-NPC group (n = 274), healthy control group (n = 175) and nasal inflammatory disease group (n = 80). Serum CYFRA21-1 levels were measured prior to radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, and their associations with T, N, and clinical classification were determined. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to discriminate the NPC group from the healthy control and nasal inflammatory disease groups. Three Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies and their correlations with serum CYFRA21-1 levels were analyzed. RESULTS: Pretreatment serum CYFRA21-1 levels were significantly elevated in the NPC group compared with the other groups (p {\textless} 0.01), Furthermore, serum CYFRA21-1 levels decreased significantly after radiotherapy (p {\textless} 0.01). Serum CYFRA21-1 levels were closely related to T, N, and clinical classifications. The area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity of the serum CYFRA21-1 levels in the NPC patients were 0.89, 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. Strong correlations were observed between serum CYFRA21-1 levels and EBV antibodies. CONCLUSION: Serum CYFRA21-1 may be a reliable and effective biomarker for NPC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of human rhino/enteroviruses on morbidity and mortality outcomes in children with severe viral respiratory infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The ICU, either PICU or cardiac ICU, at three urban academic tertiary-care children's hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients with laboratory-confirmed human rhino/enteroviruses infection between January 2010 and June 2011. INTERVENTIONS: We captured demographic and clinical data and analyzed associated morbidity and mortality outcomes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 519 patients included in our analysis. The median patient age was 2.7 years. The median hospital and ICU lengths of stay were 4 days and 2 days, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients had a history of asthma, and 25{\%} of patients had a chronic medical condition other than asthma. Thirty-two percent of patients required mechanical ventilation. Eleven patients (2.1{\%}) did not survive to hospital discharge. The rate of viral coinfection was 12.5{\%} and was not associated with mortality. Predisposing factors associated with increased mortality included immunocompromised state (p {\textless} 0.001), ICU admission severity of illness score (p {\textless} 0.001), and bacterial coinfection (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial morbidity associated with severe respiratory infection due to human rhino/enteroviruses in children. Mortality was less severe than reported in other respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The burden of illness from human rhino/enteroviruses in the ICU in terms of resource utilization may be considerable.},

abstract = {A functional immune response is crucial to prevent and limit infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in orchestrating the adaptive and innate immune responses by communicating with other cell types via antigen presentation and secretion of cytokines. In this study, we set out to understand how pneumococci activate human monocyte-derived DCs to produce interleukin-12 (IL-12) p70, an important cytokine during pneumococcal infections. We show that IL-12p70 production requires uptake of bacteria as well as the presence of the adaptor molecule TRIF, which is known to transfer signals of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or TLR4 from the endosome into the cell. While TLR4 is redundant for IL-12p70 production in DCs, we found that TLR3 is required to induce full IL-12p70 secretion. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection of DCs did not induce IL-12p70 but markedly upregulated TLR3 expression that during coinfection with S. pneumoniae significantly enhanced IL-12p70 secretion. Finally, we show that pneumococcal RNA can act as a bacterial stimulus for TLR3 and that it is a key signal to induce IL-12p70 production during challenge of DCs with pneumococci. IMPORTANCE: Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common colonizer of the nose, is the causative agent of severe and deadly diseases. A well-orchestrated immune response is vital to prevent and limit these diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) reside in the mucosal linings of the lungs and sample antigens. They are activated by pathogens to present antigens and secrete cytokines. While many studies focus on murine models, we focused our work on human monocyte-derived DCs. We found that pneumococcal RNA is an important stimulus in DCs to activate the endosomal receptor TLR3, a receptor previously not identified to sense pneumococci, and its adaptor molecule TRIF. This leads to secretion of the cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12). Severe pneumococcal pneumonia occurs closely after influenza A virus (IAV) infection. We show that IAV infection upregulates TLR3 in DCs, which sensitizes the cells to endosomal pneumococcal RNA. This new insight contributes to unlock the interplay between pneumococci, IAV, and humans.},

abstract = {Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel influenza virus that infects cattle and swine. The goal of this study was to investigate the replication and transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. Following direct intranasal inoculation of animals, the virus was detected in nasal washes of infected animals during the first 7 days postinfection. High viral titers were obtained from nasal turbinates and lung tissues of directly inoculated animals. Further, bovine FLUDV was able to transmit from the infected guinea pigs to sentinel animals by means of contact and not by aerosol dissemination under the experimental conditions tested in this study. Despite exhibiting no clinical signs, infected guinea pigs developed seroconversion and the viral antigen was detected in lungs of animals by immunohistochemistry. The observation that bovine FLUDV replicated in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs was similar to observations described previously in studies of gnotobiotic calves and pigs experimentally infected with bovine FLUDV but different from those described previously in experimental infections in ferrets and swine with a swine FLUDV, which supported virus replication only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract, including lung. Our study established that guinea pigs could be used as an animal model for studying this newly emerging influenza virus. IMPORTANCE: Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel emerging pathogen with bovine as its primary host. The epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus are not yet known. FLUDV also spreads to swine, and the presence of FLUDV-specific antibodies in humans could indicate that there is a potential for zoonosis. Our results showed that bovine FLUDV replicated in the nasal turbinate and lungs of guinea pigs at high titers and was also able to transmit from an infected animal to sentinel animals by contact. The fact that bovine FLUDV replicated productively in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of guinea pigs, similarly to virus infection in its native host, demonstrates that guinea pigs would be a suitable model host to study the replication and transmission potential of bovine FLUDV.},

The nasal swab tested positive for equine influenza by Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Further, the whole genome sequencing of the virus confirmed that it was the H3N8 subtype and was designated as A/equine/Montana/9564-1/2015 (H3N8). A BLASTn search revealed that the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), nucleoprotein (NP), and matrix (M) segments of this H3N8 isolate shared the highest percentage identity to A/equine/Tennessee/29A/2014 (H3N8) and the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein (NS) segments to A/equine/Malaysia/M201/2015 (H3N8). Phylogenetic characterization of individual gene segments, using currently available H3N8 viral genomes, of both equine and canine origin, further established that A/equine/Montana/9564-1/2015 belonged to the Florida Clade 1 viruses. Interestingly, replication kinetics of this H3N8 virus, using airway derived primary cells from multiple species, such as equine, swine, bovine, and human lung epithelial cells, demonstrated appreciable titers, when compared to Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. These findings indicate the broad host spectrum of this virus isolate and suggest the potential for cross-species transmissibility.},

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and nasal turbinate tissue confirmed cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV pp65 antigen assay conducted on peripheral blood leukocytes revealed large CMV infected mononuclear cells (diameter ∼ 50 $\mu$m) with an unusual cytoplasmic pattern of pp65 staining. These large cells were also seen in buffy coat Wright's stained smears; their size, morphology and pp65 antigen uptake pattern were consistent with CMV infected cytomegalic endothelial cells. While CMV sinus infections are occasionally encountered in AIDS patients, this is the first report to document CMV infection of the nasal mucosa with secondary sinusitis and chronic suppurative otitis media. Furthermore, the detection of circulating cytomegalic cells is described--a rare finding with pathological and clinical significance in immunocompromised patients with CMV disease.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: MRSA is a major antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogen. The reservoir of infecting isolates is colonization, which is the site of evolutionary selection. The aim was to identify if AMRs in colonizing MRSA populations diversified and potential mechanisms of resistance gene transfer in vivo. METHODS: Nasal swabs from 38 MRSA carriers admitted to hospital were plated and 20 individual colonies from each patient tested for phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility and genetically for lineage, carriage of four prophages and three plasmid families. Free bacteriophages were detected in swabs as well as their capacity for transducing resistance genes. RESULTS: Nine (24{\%}) patients carried phenotypic AMR variants and 24 (63{\%}) carried prophage and plasmid variants. If a single colony was selected for testing, the probability of detecting all AMR in that patient was 87{\%}. Sixty-four different AMR and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles were detected, mostly in the MRSA CC22 background (where CC stands for clonal complex), with up to 8 profiles per patient. Nearly half of the patients carried detectable free bacteriophages and phages successfully transduced resistance genes between laboratory and patient isolates in vitro. WGS showed MRSA core genomes were stable, while AMR and MGEs varied. CONCLUSIONS: 'Clouds' of MRSA variants that have acquired or lost AMR and MGEs are common in nasal colonizing populations and bacteriophages may play an important role in gene transfer. Accurate estimation of AMR and genetic variability has implications for diagnostics, epidemiology, antimicrobial stewardship and understanding the evolutionary selection of AMR in colonizing populations.},

abstract = {In mice, social behaviors such as mating and aggression are mediated by pheromones and related chemosignals. The vomeronasal organ (VNO) detects olfactory information from other individuals by sensory neurons tuned to respond to specific chemical cues. Receptors expressed by vomeronasal neurons are implicated in selective detection of these cues. Nearly 400 receptor genes have been identified in the mouse VNO, but the tuning properties of individual receptors remain poorly understood, in part due to the lack of a robust heterologous expression system. Here we develop a herpes virus-based amplicon delivery system to overexpress three types of vomeronasal receptor genes and to characterize cell responses to their proposed ligands. Through Ca2+ imaging in native VNO cells we show that virus-induced overexpression of V1rj2, V2r1b or Fpr3 caused a pronounced increase of responsivity to sulfated steroids, MHC-binding peptide or the synthetic hexapeptide W-peptide, respectively. Other related ligands were not recognized by infected individual neurons, indicating a high degree of selectivity by the overexpressed receptor. Removal of G-protein signaling eliminates Ca2+ responses, indicating that the endogenous second messenger system is essential for observing receptor activation. Our results provide a novel expression system for vomeronasal receptors that should be useful for understanding the molecular logic of VNO ligand detection. Functional expression of vomeronasal receptors and their deorphanization provides an essential requirement for deciphering the neural mechanisms controlling behavior.},

Animal models are indispensable for evaluating novel intervention strategies in this complex patient population. To complement existing models in rodents and non-human primates, we have evaluated the potential benefits of an HRSV infection model in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo). Nine- to 12-month-old HRSV-seronegative immunocompetent or immunocompromised ferrets were infected with a low-passage wild-type strain of HRSV subgroup A (10⁵ TCID50) administered by intra-tracheal or intra-nasal inoculation. Immune suppression was achieved by bi-daily oral administration of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. Throat and nose swabs were collected daily and animals were euthanized four, seven, or 21 days post-infection (DPI). Virus loads were determined by quantitative virus culture and qPCR. We observed efficient HRSV replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract. In immunocompromised ferrets, virus loads reached higher levels and showed delayed clearance as compared to those in immunocompetent animals. Histopathological evaluation of animals euthanized 4 DPI demonstrated that the virus replicated in the respiratory epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. These animal models can contribute to an assessment of the efficacy and safety of novel HRSV intervention strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Assess human papilloma virus (HPV) transcriptional activity in inverted Schneiderian papillomas (IPs). STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective clinicopathologic review of 19 cases of IP in patients undergoing surgical excision from 1995 to 2013 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Surgical pathology archival material was histopathologically reviewed using hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material from each case was evaluated for p16 expression using immunohistochemistry as well as HPV DNA and E6/E7 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization (via RNAscope technology), respectively. RESULTS: Eight patients were female (42{\%}), with an average age of 53 years (range, 23-82 years). Three demonstrated malignancy, and 5 subsequently recurred. Average follow-up was 49 months (range, 0-200 months), and 1 patient died from squamous cell carcinoma arising from the IP. RNAscope detected HPV mRNA transcripts exclusively within IP in 100{\%} of cases; however, in 11 patients (58{\%}), less than 1{\%} of cells exhibited transcriptional activity. Only 2 of 19 cases (11{\%}) demonstrated mRNA activity in 50{\%} or more cells. HPV DNA was detected in only 2 specimens by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals wide prevalence but limited transcriptional activity of HPV in IP. No correlation between HPV transcriptional activity and progression, recurrence, or malignant transformation was identified. These data suggest that transcription of HPV may contribute to the pathogenesis of IP, but prospective data are needed to definitively demonstrate this connection. These results also suggest that RNAscope may be more sensitive than PCR in detecting HPV activity in IP.},

abstract = {Nasal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) is a highly malignant tumor that is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is encoded by EBV and plays an important role in EBV-induced cell transformation. Therefore, we assessed the function of LMP1 as a stimulant of NKTL progression and the underlying mechanism. A human EBV-positive NKTL cell line (SNK-6) was transfected with pcDNA3.1-LMP1, LV-LMP1 shRNA or LV-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-shRNA. Then, 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to assess the proliferation of SNK-6 cells, and cell migration and invasion were analyzed by transwell chamber assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle and apoptosis. The results showed LMP1 was highly expressed in SNK-6 cells compared with control groups. Following pretreatment with LMP1 shRNA, the proliferation of SNK-6 cells was inhibited and resulted in a G0/G1 phase arrest. A reduction in invasion and migration was also observed. LMP1 silencing promoted cell apoptosis. Further mechanistic analysis suggested that LMP1 overexpression induced the expression of eIF4E, while eIF4E-shRNA dramatically attenuated the increase in cell proliferation, invasion, migration and the inhibition of apoptosis triggered by LMP-1 upregulation. Moreover, the effect of LMP1 on eIF4E expression was mediated by the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Therefore, this finding may provide a potential target against NKTL.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relation between weather conditions, viral transmission and seasonal activity of respiratory viruses is not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of outdoor weather in a temperate climate setting on the seasonal epidemiology of viruses causing respiratory tract infections, particularly influenza A (IFA). STUDY DESIGN: In total, 20,062 clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples referred for detection of respiratory pathogens using a multiplex PCR panel, between October 2010 and July 2013, were included. Results of PCR detection were compared with local meteorological data for the same period. RESULTS: Low temperature and vapor pressure (VP) were associated with weekly incidence of IFA, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus and adenovirus but no association with relative humidity was found. The incidence of human rhinovirus and enterovirus was independent of temperature. During seasonal IFA outbreaks, the weekly drop of average temperature (compared with the week before) was strongly associated with the IFA incidence recorded the following week. CONCLUSION: A sudden drop in outdoor temperature might activate the annual influenza epidemic in a temperate climate by facilitating aerosol spread in dry air. These conditions also seem to affect the incidence of other respiratory pathogens but not human rhino- or enterovirus, suggesting that routes of infection other than aerosol may be relevant for these agents.},

abstract = {The nasal administration of vaccines directed against diseases caused by upper respiratory tract infections of pathogens, such as the influenza virus, mimics the natural infection of pathogens and induces immunoglobulin A (IgA) production in the nasal cavity to effectively protect viral entry. Therefore, the development of a nasally administered vaccine is a research objective. Because the antigenicity of influenza split vaccines is low, nasal inoculation with the vaccine alone does not induce strong IgA production in the nasal cavity. However, the addition of adjuvants activates the innate immune response, enhancing antigen-specific IgA production and the T-cell response. Although the development of suitable adjuvants for nasal vaccinations is in progress, the mechanism by which adjuvants promote the immune response is still unclear. In this review, we discuss the mucosal immune response, especially in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, induced in response to the intranasal inoculation of an influenza vaccine and adjuvants in animal models.},

The mechanism whereby polyI:C skews to IgA production in the nasal-associated lymph tissue (NALT) was investigated in mouse models. Nasally instilled polyI:C was endocytosed into CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) and induced T-cell activation, including interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ production. According to knockout mouse studies, polyI:C activated the Toll-like receptor 3 signal via the adapter TICAM-1 (also called TRIF), that mainly caused T-cell-dependent IgA production. Nasal CD103(+) DCs activated transforming growth factor-$\beta$ signaling and activation-induced cytidine deaminase upon polyI:C stimulation. IgA rather than IgG production was impaired in Batf3(-/-) mice, where CD103(+) DCs are defective. Genomic recombination occurred in IgA-producing cells in association with polyI:C-stimulated DCs and nasal microenvironment. PolyI:C induced B-cell-activating factor expression and weakly triggered T-cell-independent IgA production. PolyI:C simultaneously activated mitochondrial antiviral signaling and then type I IFN receptor pathways, which only minimally participated in IgA production. Taken together, CD103(+) DCs in NALT are indispensable for the adjuvant activity of polyI:C in enhancing vaccine-specific IgA induction and protective immunity against influenza viruses.},

We used a multiplex respiratory panel to analyze nose and throat swabs collected at the start and end of the training period, and from participants experiencing respiratory symptoms during follow-up. Paired sera were tested for influenza seroconversion using a hemagglutinin inhibition assay. Overall rates of upper respiratory illness and influenza-like illness were 3.1 and 2.0 episodes per 100 person-weeks, respectively. A pathogen was detected in 96{\%} of samples. The most commonly detected microbes were Haemophilus influenzae type B (62.7{\%}) or non-type B (58.2{\%}) and rhinovirus (22.4{\%}). At baseline, bacterial colonization was high and included H. influenzae type B (82.3{\%}), H. influenzae non-type B (31.5{\%}), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.6{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (8.5{\%}), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.5{\%}). At the end of follow-up, colonization with H. influenzae non-type B had increased to 74.1{\%}, and S. pneumoniae to 33.6{\%}. In the serology subset, the rate of influenza infection was 3.4 per 100 person-months; 58{\%} of influenza infections resulted in clinical disease. Our study provides key data on the epidemiology and transmission of respiratory pathogens in tropical settings. Our results emphasize the need for improved infection prevention and control in military environments, given the high burden of illness and potential for intense transmission of respiratory pathogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assays have improved diagnostic sensitivity for a wide range of pathogens. However, co-detection of multiple agents and bacterial colonization make it difficult to distinguish between asymptomatic infection or illness aetiology. We assessed whether semi-quantitative microbial load data can differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic states for common respiratory pathogens. METHODS: We obtained throat and nasal swab samples from military trainees at two Thai Army barracks. Specimens were collected at the start and end of 10-week training periods (non-acute samples), and from individuals who developed upper respiratory tract infection during training (acute samples). We analysed the samples using a commercial multiplex respiratory panel comprising 33 bacterial, viral and fungal targets. We used random effects tobit models to compare cycle threshold (Ct) value distributions from non-acute and acute samples. RESULTS: We analysed 341 non-acute and 145 acute swab samples from 274 participants. Haemophilus influenzae type B was the most commonly detected microbe (77.4{\%} of non-acute and 64.8{\%} of acute samples). In acute samples, nine specific microbe pairs were detected more frequently than expected by chance. Regression models indicated significantly lower microbial load in non-acute relative to acute samples for H. influenzae non-type B, Streptococcus pneumoniae and rhinovirus, although it was not possible to identify a Ct-value threshold indicating causal etiology for any of these organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-quantitative measures of microbial concentration did not reliably differentiate between illness and asymptomatic colonization, suggesting that clinical symptoms may not always be directly related to microbial load for common respiratory infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination is the most effective intervention to prevent influenza virus infections. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) can vary due to factors such as matching between vaccine strains and prevailing strains, age and other characteristics of the vaccine recipients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate influenza VE against medically-attended illness in different age groups and against specific influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong. METHODS: A test-negative study was conducted from December 2014 through August 2017 in 20 outpatient clinics. Patients at least 6 months of age presenting with at least two symptoms of acute respiratory illness, ARI (fever ≥37.8 °C, cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache, myalgia and phlegm) within 72 h of onset were tested for influenza virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Vaccination history was assessed by self-report or medical records at the clinics. VE against medically-attended illness was estimated using conditional logistic regression for influenza PCR result versus vaccination history, matching by calendar time and adjusting for age, age-squared, sex, and chronic medical illness. Additional analyses examined VE by age group and by influenza type/subtype. RESULTS: We enrolled 2566 patients, of whom 1118 (43.6{\%}) tested positive for influenza A or B virus by PCR. Test-positive subjects were generally older, more likely to present with one of the symptoms of ARI, and less likely to receive vaccination against influenza. VE estimates for influenza A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B/Yamagata and B/Victoria were 61.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, CI: 21.8{\%}, 81.1{\%}), 26.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: -1.3{\%}, 46.6{\%}), 67.0{\%} (95{\%} CI: 25.9{\%}, 85.3{\%}), 60.4{\%} (95{\%} CI: 0.3{\%}, 84.3{\%}), respectively. Estimates of VE by age group were generally higher in adults aged 50-64 and lower among children and older adults. CONCLUSIONS: VE against medically-attended influenza was moderate in Hong Kong, confirming the impact of influenza vaccination in reducing disease burden. The reduced VE for influenza A(H3N2) is a continuing concern.},

A quantitative microbial risk model was used to determine the probability of infection from the concentration of virus on the hands. The model incorporated variation in hand size, frequency of touching orifices (nose, mouth, eyes), and percent transfer to the site of infection, as well as, dose-response for each virus. Data on the occurrence of virus on household members' hands from an intervention study using MS-2 coliphage was used to determine the reduction of viruses on the hands pre- and post-intervention. It was found that the risk of rhinovirus, rotavirus or norovirus infection after the intervention was reduced by 47-98{\%} depending upon the initial concentration of virus on the hands.},

abstract = {Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the commonest cause of the common cold. While HRV is less pathogenic than other respiratory viruses, it is frequently associated with exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases such as rhinosinusitis and asthma. Nasal epithelial cells are the first sites of viral contact, immune initiation, and airway interconnectivity, but there are limited studies on HRV infection of nasal epithelial cells. Hence, we established a model of HRV infection of in vitro-differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) derived from multiple individuals. Through HRV infection of hNECs, we found that HRV mainly targeted ciliated cells and preferentially induced type I and III interferon antiviral pathways. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of inflammatory genes suggested predominant type 1 immunity signaling and recruitment, with secreted CXCL9, IP-10, CXCL11, and RANTES as likely initiators of airway inflammatory responses. Additionally, we further explored HRV bidirectional release from the hNECs and identified 11 associated genes. Other HRV interactions were also identified through a systematic comparison with influenza A virus infection of hNECs. Overall, this in vitro hNEC HRV infection model provides a platform for repeatable and controlled studies of different individuals, thus providing novel insights into the roles of human nasal epithelium in HRV interaction and immune initiation.},

abstract = {Hearing loss, including genetic hearing loss, is one of the most common forms of sensory deficits in humans with limited options of treatment. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer has been shown to recover auditory functions effectively in mouse models of genetic deafness when delivered at neonatal stages. However, the mouse cochlea is still developing at those time points, whereas in humans, the newborn inner ears are already fully mature. For effective gene therapy to treat genetic deafness, it is necessary to determine whether AAV-mediated therapy can be equally effective in the fully mature mouse inner ear without causing damage to the inner ear. This study tested several AAV serotypes by canalostomy in adult mice. It is shown that most AAVs transduce the sensory inner hair cells efficiently, but are less efficient at transducing outer hair cells. A subset of AAVs also transduces non-sensory cochlear cell types. Neither the surgical procedure of canalostomy nor the AAV serotypes damage hair cells or impair normal hearing. The studies indicate that canalostomy can be a viable route for safe and efficient gene delivery, and they expand the repertoire of AAVs to target diverse cell types in the adult inner ear.},

abstract = {Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common chronic inflammatory condition of the nasal mucosal tissue. The interleukin-13 (IL-13) signaling pathway is of great importance in the pathogenesis of AR. However, how the signaling molecules in this pathway are regulated, particularly through microRNAs (miRNAs), remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory role and mechanism of miRNA-143 (miR-143) in IL-13-induced inflammatory cytokine and mucus production in nasal epithelial cells (NECs) from AR patients. Our results showed that forced expression of miR-143 significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), eotaxin and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in IL-13-stimulated NECs. Moreover, we confirmed that miR-143 directly targeted and significantly suppressed IL-13 receptor $\alpha$1 chain (IL13R$\alpha$1) gene expression. This study thus suggests that miR-143 regulation of IL-13-induced inflammatory cytokine and mucus production in NECs from AR patients probably partly depends on inhibition of IL13R$\alpha$1. Therefore, the IL13R$\alpha$1 signaling pathway may be a potential target for the prevention and treatment of AR by miR-143.},

abstract = {AIM: To combine clinical and molecular markers into an algorithm for predicting outcome for individual patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA/p16(INK4a) positive tonsillar and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC and BOTSCC). BACKGROUND: Head-neck cancer treatment has become more intensified, comprising not only surgery and radiotherapy, but also induction/concomitant chemotherapy and targeted therapy. With less treatment, 3-year disease free survival (DFS) is 80{\%} for HPV-positive TSCC and BOTSCC. An 85-100{\%} 3-year DFS is observed for HPV(+) TSCC and BOTSCC with absence of HLA class I, or CD44 expression, or high CD8(+) tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) counts suggesting that therapy could be tapered for many if patients could be identified individually. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated curatively, with HPV DNA/p16(INK4a) positive tumours examined for HLA class I and II, CD44 and CD8(+)TILs, were included. An L1-regularised logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of the biomarker data, age, stage, diagnosis, smoking and treatment on 3-year risk of death or relapse on a training cohort of 197 patients diagnosed 2000-2007 and validated on a cohort of 118 patients diagnosed 2008-2011. RESULTS: The variables finally included in the model were HLA class I, CD8(+) TILs, age, stage and diagnosis (TSCC or BOTSCC). The model showed acceptable discrimination and calibration. The discriminative ability of the model did not diminish after validation (AUC=0.77). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first model to utilise information from several markers to predict an individual probability of clinical outcome for patients with HPV DNA/p16(INK4a) positive tumours.},

abstract = {White-nose syndrome is one of the most lethal wildlife diseases, killing over 5 million North American bats since it was first reported in 2006. The causal agent of the disease is a psychrophilic filamentous fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. The fungus is widely distributed in North America and Europe and has recently been found in some parts of Asia, but interestingly, no mass mortality is observed in European or Asian bats. Here we report a novel double-stranded RNA virus found in North American isolates of the fungus and show that the virus can be used as a tool to study the epidemiology of White-nose syndrome. The virus, termed Pseudogymnoascus destructans partitivirus-pa, contains 2 genomic segments, dsRNA 1 and dsRNA 2 of 1.76 kbp and 1.59 kbp respectively, each possessing a single open reading frame, and forms isometric particles approximately 30 nm in diameter, characteristic of the genus Gammapartitivirus in the family Partitiviridae. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the virus is closely related to Penicillium stoloniferum virus S. We were able to cure P. destructans of the virus by treating fungal cultures with polyethylene glycol. Examination of 62 isolates of P. destructans including 35 from United States, 10 from Canada and 17 from Europe showed virus infection only in North American isolates of the fungus. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using nucleotide sequences of the viral coat protein geographically clustered North American isolates indicating fungal spread followed by local adaptation of P. destructans in different regions of the United States and Canada. This is the first demonstration that a mycovirus potentially can be used to study fungal disease epidemiology.},

abstract = {It is now well established that human papillomavirus (HPV) is an important causative factor in a subgroup of head and neck cancer. In the head and neck, while HPV is strongly associated with squamous cell carcinoma arising in the oropharynx, there is a growing interest in HPV-associated neoplasms of non-oropharyngeal origin including those which arise within sinonasal and nasopharyngeal mucosa. This article reviews current literature on the association of HPV with Scheiderian papillomas, sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, carcinoma with adenoid cystic-like features, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Several clinical implications of HPV detection in sinonasal and nasopharyngeal carcinomas are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated the feasibility of asking pregnant women to self-collect and ship respiratory specimens. METHODS: In a preliminary laboratory study, we compared the RT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) values of influenza A and B viruses incubated at 4 storage temperatures (from 4 to 35°C) for 6 time periods (8, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours and 30 days), resulting in 24 conditions that were compared to an aliquot tested after standard freezing (-20°C) (baseline condition). In a subsequent pilot study, during January-February, 2014, we delivered respiratory specimen collection kits to 53 pregnant women with a medically attended acute respiratory illness using three delivery methods. RESULTS: CT values were stable after storage at temperatures {\textless}27°C for up to 72 hours for influenza A viruses and 48 hours for influenza B viruses. Of 53 women who received kits during the pilot, 89{\%} collected and shipped nasal swabs as requested. However, 30{\%} (14/47) of the women took over 2 days to collect and ship their specimen. The human control gene, ribonuclease P (RNase P), was detected in 100{\%} of nasal swab specimens. However, the mean CT values for RNase P (26.5, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 26.0-27.1) and for the 8 influenza A virus positives in our pilot (32.2, 95{\%} CI = 28.9-35.5) were significantly higher than the CTs observed in our 2010-2012 study using staff-collected nasal pharyngeal swabs (P-values {\textless} 0.01). DISCUSSION: Self-collection of respiratory specimens is a promising research method, but further research is needed to quantify the sensitivity and specificity of the approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Existing respiratory mucosal sampling methods are flawed, particularly in a pediatric bronchiolitis setting. METHODS: Twenty-four infants with bronchiolitis were recruited: 12 were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive, 12 were RSV-negative. Infants were sampled by nasosorption and nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA). RESULTS: Nasosorption was well tolerated and identified all RSV+ samples. RSV load measured by nasosorption (but not NPA) correlated with length of hospital stay (P = .04) and requirement for mechanical ventilation (P = .03). Nasosorption (but not NPA) levels of interferon $\gamma$, interleukin 1$\beta$, CCL5/RANTES, and interleukin 10 (IL-10) were elevated in RSV+ bronchiolitis (all P {\textless} .05), furthermore CCL5 and IL-10 correlated with RSV load (P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS: Nasosorption allowed measurement of RSV load and the mucosal inflammatory response in infants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral infection is a common cause of olfactory dysfunction. The complexities of studying post-viral olfactory loss in humans have impaired further progress in understanding the underlying mechanism. Recently, evidence from clinical studies has implicated Parainfluenza virus 3 as a causal agent. An animal model of post viral olfactory disorders (PVOD) would allow better understanding of disease pathogenesis and represent a major advance in the field. OBJECTIVE: To develop a mouse model of PVOD by evaluating the effects of Sendai virus (SeV), the murine counterpart of Parainfluenza virus, on olfactory function and regenerative ability of the olfactory epithelium. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice (6-8 months old) were inoculated intranasally with SeV or ultraviolet (UV)-inactivated virus (UV-SeV). On days 3, 10, 15, 30 and 60 post-infection, olfactory epithelium was harvested and analyzed by histopathology and immunohistochemical detection of S-phase nuclei. We also measured apoptosis by TUNEL assay and viral load by real-time PCR. The buried food test (BFT) was used to measure olfactory function of mice at day 60. In parallel, cultured murine olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) infected with SeV or UV-SeV were tested for odorant-mixture response by measuring changes in intracellular calcium concentrations indicated by fura-4 AM assay. RESULTS: Mice infected with SeV suffered from olfactory dysfunction, peaking on day 15, with no loss observed with UV-SeV. At 60 days, four out of 12 mice infected with SeV still had not recovered, with continued normal function in controls. Viral copies of SeV persisted in both the olfactory epithelium (OE) and the olfactory bulb (OB) for at least 60 days. At day 10 and after, both unit length labeling index (ULLI) of apoptosis and ULLI of proliferation in the SeV group was markedly less than the UV-SeV group. In primary cultured OSNs infected by SeV, the percentage of cells responding to mixed odors was markedly lower in the SeV group compared to UV-SeV (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that SeV impairs olfaction, persists in OE and OB tissue, reduces their regenerative ability, and impairs the normal physiological function of OSNs without gross cytopathology. This mouse model shares key features of human post-viral olfactory loss, supporting its future use in studies of PVOD. Further testing and development of this model should allow us to clarify the pathophysiology of PVOD.},

abstract = {Tight junctions (TJs) alteration is commonly seen in airway inflammatory diseases. Oncostatin M (OSM) is an inflammatory mediator associated with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). We have previously shown that human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) are highly permissive cells for influenza A virus (IAV). However, its role in TJs alteration and the effects of IAV on inducing OSM expression in nasal epithelium remains to be further investigated. In this study, OSM and TJs expression was measured and compared between inferior turbinate from healthy controls and nasal polyps from CRSwNP. Additionally, hNECs cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) were infected with H3N2 influenza virus to study the role of influenza virus in inducing epithelial OSM expression as a possible means of exacerbation. The expression of ZO-1, claudin-1, and occludin was markedly decreased and correlated negatively with that of OSM in CRSwNP. By using the in vitro hNEC model, H3N2 infection resulted in significantly increased OSM expression (2.2-, 4.7- and 3.9-fold higher at 8, 24, and 48 h post-infection vs. mock infection). Furthermore, OSM is found to co-localize with ciliated and goblet cells in hNECs infected with H3N2 influenza virus. Our findings demonstrated that increased OSM expression is implicated in CRSwNP as a possible mechanism of TJs' impairment, which can be further augmented following influenza infection via epithelial OSM expression, possibly contributing to exacerbations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) are common causes of febrile illnesses in many settings in Senegal. These infections are usually managed presumptively due to lack of appropriate diagnostic tools. This situation, can lead to poor management of febrile illness or antibiotic misuse. In addition, there are limited data on the spectrum of pathogens commonly responsible for these ARI. This study was conducted to explore the pathogens community among patients with acute respiratory infection in a rural area in Senegal. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted from August to December 2015. Children and adult patients attending Keur Soc{\'{e}} health post for signs suggestive of acute respiratory infection were enrolled after providing inform consent. Eligible participants were recruited using a consecutive sampling method. Paired nose and throat swabs were collected for pathogen detection. Samples were processed using a multiplex PCR designed to identify 21 pathogens including both virus and bacteria. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients participated in the study. Samples positivity rate was evaluated at 95.2{\%} (238/250). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen (74{\%}) and was present in all months and all age-groups, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (28,8{\%}) and rhinovirus (28,4{\%}). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was detected only among children under 5 years old in August and September while coronavirus was present in all age groups, during the months of October and December. CONCLUSION: This pilot study revealed a diversity of pathogens over the time and across all age groups, highlighting the need for further exploration. A pathogen community approach including both virus and bacteria at a larger scale becomes crucial for a better understanding of transmission dynamics at population level in order to help shape ARI control strategies.},

Clinical signs of the disease did not appear following intranasal (i.n.) challenge of mice with strain Ind-3a of variola virus (VARV), even when using the highest possible dose of the virus (5.2 log10 p.f.u.). The 50 {\%} infective doses (ID50) of VARV, estimated by the virus presence or absence in the lungs 3 and 4 days post-infection, were 2.7 ± 0.4 log10 p.f.u. for ICR mice and 3.5 ± 0.7 log10 p.f.u. for SCID mice. After i.n. challenge of ICR and SCID mice with VARV 30 and 50 ID50, respectively, steady reproduction of the virus occurred only in the respiratory tract (lungs and nose). Pathological inflammatory destructive changes were revealed in the respiratory tract and the primary target cells for VARV (macrophages and epithelial cells) in mice, similar to those in humans and cynomolgus macaques. The use of mice to assess antiviral efficacies of NIOCH-14 and ST-246 demonstrated the compliance of results with those described in scientific literature, which opens up the prospect of their use as an animal model for smallpox to develop anti-smallpox drugs intended for humans.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burden of recurrent respiratory infections is unclear. We identified young children with recurrent respiratory infections in order to characterize the clinical manifestations, risk factors and short-term consequences. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, 1089 children were followed from birth to 2 years of age for respiratory infections by a daily symptom diary. Nasal swabs taken during respiratory infections were analyzed for viruses from 714 children. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected at 2 months of age were cultured for bacteria. The 10{\%} of children with the highest number of annual respiratory illness days were defined to have recurrent respiratory tract infections. RESULTS: The 90th percentile in the number of annual respiratory illness days was 98. Children above this limit (n = 109) had a median of 9.6 acute respiratory infections per year. Rhinovirus was detected in 58{\%} of their infections. Of the children with recurrent infections, 60{\%} were diagnosed with at least 3 episodes of acute otitis media, 73{\%} received at least 3 antibiotic treatments and 21{\%} were hospitalized for an acute respiratory infection. Tympanostomy was performed for 35{\%} and adenoidectomy for 13{\%} of the children. Asthma was diagnosed in 12{\%} by 24 months of age. Older siblings increased the risk of recurrent respiratory infections. Early nasopharyngeal colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae was common in children who later developed recurrent infections. CONCLUSIONS: Children with recurrent respiratory infections frequently use health care services and antibiotics, undergo surgical procedures and are at risk for asthma in early life. Having older siblings increases the risk of recurrent infections.},

abstract = {Braak and Del Tredici have proposed that typical Parkinson disease (PD) has its origins in the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the olfactory system has insufficiently been explored in the pathogeneses of PD and Alzheimer disease (AD) in laboratory models. Here, we demonstrate applications of a new method to process mouse heads for microscopy by sectioning, mounting, and staining whole skulls ('holocranohistochemistry'). This technique permits the visualization of the olfactory system from the nasal cavity to mitral cells and dopamine-producing interneurons of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. We applied this method to two specific goals: first, to visualize PD- and AD-linked gene expression in the olfactory system, where we detected abundant, endogenous $\alpha$-synuclein and tau expression in the olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, we observed amyloid-$\beta$ plaques and proteinase-K-resistant $\alpha$-synuclein species, respectively, in cranial nerve-I of APP- and human SNCA-over-expressing mice. The second application of the technique was to the modeling of gene-environment interactions in the nasal cavity of mice. We tracked the infection of a neurotropic respiratory-enteric-orphan virus from the nose pad into cranial nerves-I (and -V) and monitored the ensuing brain infection. Given its abundance in the olfactory epithelia, we questioned whether $\alpha$-synuclein played a role in innate host defenses to modify the outcome of infections. Indeed, Snca-null mice were more likely to succumb to viral encephalitis versus their wild-type littermates. Moreover, using a bacterial sepsis model, Snca-null mice were less able to control infection after intravenous inoculation with Salmonella typhimurium. Together, holocranohistochemistry enabled new discoveries related to $\alpha$-synuclein expression and its function in mice. Future studies will address: the role of Mapt and mutant SNCA alleles in infection paradigms; the contribution of xenobiotics in the initiation of idiopathic PD; and the safety to the host when systemically targeting $\alpha$-synuclein by immunotherapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a common disease in adolescents. However, IM is often considered a rare disease in early childhood. We aimed to describe the classical presentation of adolescent EBV-associated IM compared to EBV infection at younger age. METHODS: All immunocompetent children hospitalized at Hvidovre University Hospital, Copenhagen between 2002 and 2013, who presented with clinical features that prompted a laboratory test for EBV, and who tested positive by presence of EBV-specific antibodies, heterophile antibodies or a positive EBV PCR were included (n = 95). RESULTS: Children aged 1-2 years were the age group most commonly hospitalized with acute EBV infection (27{\%} of the cohort), followed by teenagers aged 14-15 years (23{\%}). Fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillitis and fatigue were the most common physical findings overall. Dividing the children into three age groups (0-4 years, 5-10 years and 11-15 years) revealed that the oldest age groups significantly more often suffered from headache, tonsillitis, sore throat, abdominal pain and nausea. Young children typically presented with a runny nose, fever, fatigue and cervical adenitis. Compared with children under 5, children aged 5-15 years more often showed lymphocytosis (84{\%} vs 62{\%}), elevated alanine aminotransferase (77{\%} vs 33{\%}) and lactate dehydrogenase (79{\%} vs 44{\%}). CONCLUSION: EBV infection is common in young children, and children less than 3 years of age constitute the largest group of hospitalizations for acute EBV infection. EBV-associated IM should be suspected in febrile children of all ages with tonsillitis, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis and elevated liver enzymes.},

abstract = {We have previously established that mucosal uptake of recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) vaccines is far superior to other vector-based vaccines. Specifically, intranasal priming with rFPV vaccines can recruit unique antigen-presenting cells, which induce excellent mucosal and systemic HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity. In this study, we have for the first time investigated the in vivo dissemination, safety and expression kinetics of rFPV post intranasal delivery using recombinant viruses expressing green fluorescent protein or mCherry. Both confocal microscopy of tissue sections using green fluorescent protein and in vivo Imaging System (IVIS) spectrum live animal and whole organ imaging studies using mCherry revealed that (i) the peak antigen expression occurs 12 to 24 h post vaccination and no active viral gene expression is detected 96 h post vaccination. (ii) The virus only infects the initial vaccination site (lung and nasal cavity) and does not disseminate to distal sites such as the spleen or gut. (iii) More importantly, rFPV does not cross the olfactory receptor neuron pathway. Collectively, our findings indicate that rFPV vector-based vaccines have all the hallmarks of a safe and effective mucosal delivery vector, suitable for clinical evaluation.},

abstract = {Pakistan has a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, estimated at 4.9{\%} (2,290/46,843) in the 2007 national HCV seroprevalence survey. We used data from this survey to assess the importance of risk factor associations with HCV prevalence in Pakistan. Exposures were grouped as community (going to the barbers, sharing smoking equipment, having an ear/nose piercing, tattoo, or acupuncture), healthcare (ever having hemodialysis, blood transfusion, or ≥ 5 injections in the last year), demographic (marital status and age), and socio-economic (illiterate or laborer). We used mutually adjusted multivariable regression analysis, stratified by sex, to determine associations with HCV infection, their population attributable fraction, and how risk of infection accumulates with multiple exposures. Strength of associations was assessed using adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Community [aOR females 1.5 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 1.2, 1.8); males 1.2 (1.1, 1.4)] and healthcare [females 1.4 (1.2, 1.6); males 1.2 (1.1, 1.4)] exposures, low socio-economic status [females 1.6 (1.3, 1.80); males 1.3 (1.2, 1.5)], and marriage [females 1.5 (1.2, 1.9); males 1.4 (1.1, 1.8)] were associated with increased HCV infection. Among married women, the number of children was associated with an increase in HCV infection; linear trend aOR per child 1.06 (1.01, 1.11). Fewer infections could be attributed to healthcare exposures (females 13{\%}; males 6{\%}) than to community exposures (females 25{\%}; males 9{\%}). Prevalence increased from 3{\%} to 10{\%} when cumulative exposures increased from 1 to ≥ 4 [aOR per additional exposure for females 1.5 (1.4, 1.6); males 1.2 (1.2, 1.3)]. A combination of community, healthcare, and other factors appear to drive the Pakistan HCV epidemic, highlighting the need for a comprehensive array of prevention strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral shedding is often considered to correlate with the infectivity of influenza, but the evidence for this is limited. METHODS: In a detailed study of influenza virus transmission within households in 2008-2012, index case patients with confirmed influenza were identified in outpatient clinics, and we collected nose and throat swab specimens for testing by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from all household members regardless of illness. We used individual-based hazard models to characterize the relationship between viral load (V) and infectivity. RESULTS: Assuming that infectivity was proportional to viral load V gave the worst fit, because it strongly overestimated the proportion of transmission occurring at symptom onset. Alternative models assuming that infectivity was proportional to a various functions of V provided better fits, although they all overestimated the proportion of transmission occurring {\textgreater}3 days after symptom onset. The best fitting model assumed that infectivity was proportion to V($\gamma$), with estimates of $\gamma$ = 0.136 and $\gamma$ = 0.156 for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All the models we considered that used viral loads to approximate infectivity of a case imperfectly explained the timing of influenza secondary infections in households. Identification of more accurate correlates of infectivity will be important to inform control policies and disease modeling.},

Viral shedding is used as a proxy measure of infectivity in many studies. However, the evidence for this is limited. METHODS: In a detailed study of influenza virus transmission within households in 2008-12, we recruited index cases with confirmed influenza infection from outpatient clinics, and followed up their household contacts for 7-10 days to identify secondary infections. We used individual-based hazard models to characterize the relationship between individual viral shedding and individual infectivity. RESULTS: We analyzed 386 households with 1147 household contacts. Index cases were separated into 3 groups according to their estimated level of viral shedding at symptom onset. We did not find a statistically significant association of virus shedding with transmission. Index cases in medium and higher viral shedding groups were estimated to have 21{\%} (95{\%} CI: -29{\%}, 113{\%}) and 44{\%} (CI: -16{\%}, 167{\%}) higher infectivity, compared with those in the lower viral shedding group. CONCLUSIONS: Individual viral load measured by RT-PCR in the nose and throat was at most weakly correlated with individual infectivity in households. Other correlates of infectivity should be examined in future studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is mainly related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. As OPSCCs are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, mortality and morbidity remain high. There are no diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of OPSCC. METHODS: Serum from 25 patients with stage I-II OPSCC, and 12 healthy controls, was studied with quantitative label-free proteomics using ultra-definition MS(E). Statistical analyses were performed to identify the proteins most reliably distinguishing early-stage OPSCCs from controls. P16 was used as a surrogate marker for HPV. P16-positive and P16-negative tumours were analysed separately. RESULTS: With two or more unique proteins per identification, 176 proteins were quantified. A clear separation between patients with early-stage tumours and controls was seen in principal component analysis. Latent structures discriminant analysis identified 96 proteins, most reliably differentiating OPSCC patients from controls, with 13 upregulated and 83 downregulated proteins in study cases. The set of proteins was studied further with network, pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses, and found to participate in lipid metabolism, for example. CONCLUSIONS: We found a set of serum proteins distinguishing early-stage OPSCC from healthy individuals, and suggest a protein set for further evaluation as a diagnostic biomarker panel for OPSCC.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Recurrent wheeze and asthma are thought to result from alterations in early life immune development following respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. However, prior studies of the nasal immune response to infection have assessed only individual cytokines, which does not capture the whole spectrum of response to infection. OBJECTIVES: To identify nasal immune phenotypes in response to RSV infection and their association with recurrent wheeze. METHODS: A birth cohort of term healthy infants born June to December were recruited and followed to capture the first infant RSV infection. Nasal wash samples were collected during acute respiratory infection, viruses were identified by RT-PCR, and immune-response analytes were assayed using a multianalyte bead-based panel. Immune-response clusters were identified using machine learning, and association with recurrent wheeze at age 1 and 2 years was assessed using logistic regression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We identified two novel and distinct immune-response clusters to RSV and human rhinovirus. In RSV-infected infants, a nasal immune-response cluster characterized by lower non-IFN antiviral immune-response mediators, and higher type-2 and type-17 cytokines was significantly associated with first and second year recurrent wheeze. In comparison, we did not observe this in infants with human rhinovirus acute respiratory infection. Based on network analysis, type-2 and type-17 cytokines were central to the immune response to RSV, whereas growth factors and chemokines were central to the immune response to human rhinovirus. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct immune-response clusters during infant RSV infection and their association with risk of recurrent wheeze provide insights into the risk factors for and mechanisms of asthma development.},

abstract = {Ingestion of probiotics appears to have modest effects on the incidence of viral respiratory infection. The mechanism of these effects is not clear; however, there is evidence from animal models that the probiotic may have an effect on innate immune responses to pathogens. The purpose of this randomised, placebo-controlled study was to determine the effect of administration of Bifidobacterium animalis subspecies lactis Bl-04 on innate and adaptive host responses to experimental rhinovirus challenge. The effect on the response of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8) to rhinovirus infection was defined as the primary endpoint for the study. 152 seronegative volunteers who had been supplemented for 28 days, 73 with probiotic and 79 with placebo, were challenged with RV-A39. Supplement or placebo administration was then continued for five days during collection of specimens for assessment of host response, infection, and symptoms. 58 probiotic and 57 placebo-supplemented volunteers met protocol-defined criteria for analysis. Probiotic resulted in higher nasal lavage CXCL8 on day 0 prior to virus challenge (90 vs 58 pg/ml, respectively, P=0.04, ANCOVA). The CXCL8 response to rhinovirus infection in nasal lavage was significantly reduced in the probiotic treated group (P=0.03, ANCOVA). Probiotic was also associated with a reduction in nasal lavage virus titre and the proportion of subjects shedding virus in nasal secretions (76{\%} in the probiotic group, 91{\%} in the placebo group, P=0.04, Fisher Exact test). The administration of probiotic did not influence lower respiratory inflammation (assessed by exhaled nitric oxide), subjective symptom scores, or infection rate. This study demonstrates that ingestion of Bl-04 may have an effect on the baseline state of innate immunity in the nose and on the subsequent response of the human host to rhinovirus infection.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious public health problem worldwide. Reports have shown that 68,600 people die of HBV infection and more than 300,000 deaths due to liver cancer secondary to hepatitis B every year globally. Women who are infected with HBV can vertically transmit the infection to their infants. This study aims to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and associated factors among pregnant women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women who attended antenatal care clinic (ANC) for routine pregnancy check-up between 18 March 2015 and 15 May 2015. Data were collected by face to face interview using a pre-tested questionnaire. Serum was withdrawn for each study subject and used to test for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between explanatory variables and outcome variable. The prevalence of HBV infection was found to be 6.9{\%}. Interestingly, the history of abortion (AOR 10.9; 95{\%} CI: 2.2-53.9), nose piercing (AOR 9.1; 95{\%} CI: 1.34-61.79), surgical procedure (AOR 12.8; 95{\%} CI: 1.68-97.06) and history of multiple sexual partners (AOR 16.8; 95{\%} CI: 3.18-89.06) were significant predictors of HBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: This study determined that the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women was 6.9{\%}, implying that it is high-intermediate endemic area, which is important public health issue needs to be addressed. History of abortion, nose piercing, surgical procedures and multiple sexual partners were significantly associated with this viral infection. Accordingly we advocate that health education programs on the mode of HBV transmission, high-risk behaviors and methods of preventions should be instituted at antenatal care clinics to raise the awareness of mothers and limit the spread of infection. It is also advisable to implement nosocomial infection prevention strategies to prevent the transmissions of HBV through health care related activities such as surgical procedures. Furthermore, all pregnant women should be screened for HBV, treated if necessary to reduce their viral loads and their children vaccinated at birth with the single-dose hepatitis B vaccine to break the cycle of mother-to-child transmission.},

Development of rapid and accurate BRSV diagnostic tools would aid in the appropriate control of this important pathogen. The objective of this study was to characterize infections induced by BRSV by means of rapid patient-side immunomigration assays used for diagnosis of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) in humans. Nasal and tracheal swabs were obtained from healthy calves of various beef and dairy breeds - Holstein-Friesian, Simmental, Charolais, Belgian Blue and Limousin, between the ages of 5 and 12 months, from 26 farms. BRSV was identified using two rapid immunomigration assays, TruRSV{\textregistered} and Clearview{\textregistered} RSV, and compared with RT-PCR as a reference technique. BRSV was found in 73.1{\%} of all the herds tested. High agreement with RT-PCR was obtained for TruRSV{\textregistered} ($\kappa$ = 0.824), while in the case of the Clearview{\textregistered} RSV test, agreement with PCR was moderate ($\kappa$ = 0.420). The results demonstrate that rapid patient-side immunomigration assays designed to detect hRSV can be used to accurately detect BRSV in field samples collected from cattle.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a major contributor to bovine respiratory disease complex in dairy and beef calves, especially during the first year of life. There is a lack of comprehensive information about the prevalence of infection in cattle herds in Poland as well as in European countries outside the European Union. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of BRSV infections in young beef and dairy cattle in southeastern Poland, a region that has direct contact with non-EU countries. Animals {\&} methods: Nasal swabs and sera (n = 120) were obtained from young cattle aged 6-12 months from 45 farms in eastern and southeastern Poland. BRSV antigen detection in the nasal swabs was carried out using a rapid immunomigration assay used in diagnosing human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infections in humans, while antibodies to BRSV were detected in the sera by ELISA antibody detection. RESULTS: The study confirmed the presence of BRSV infections in young cattle under 12 months of age from both dairy and beef herds. BRSV was detected in 27 of the 45 herds (60{\%}) sampled. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study indicate a high prevalence of BRSV infections in cattle in Poland, which may have a significant influence on health status and animal performance. The prevalence of infection is similar to that in other parts of Poland and other countries in Europe. Development of strategies to reduce BRSV infections is needed to improve health and productivity.},

abstract = {Two human parvoviruses were recently discovered by metagenomics in Africa, bufavirus (BuV) in 2012 and tusavirus (TuV) in 2014. These viruses have been studied exclusively by PCR in stool and detected only in patients with diarrhoea, although at low prevalence. Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1{\%}) and 10/180 adults (5.6{\%}), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4{\%}). All children and 91{\%} of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3{\%}) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1{\%}). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.},

abstract = {Preschool rhinovirus-induced wheeze is associated with an increased risk of asthma. In adult asthma, exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOC) are associated with inflammatory activity. We therefore hypothesised that acute preschool wheeze is accompanied by a differential profile of exhaled VOC, which is maintained after resolution of symptoms in those children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze. We included 178 children (mean±sd age 22±9 months) from the EUROPA cohort comparing asymptomatic and wheezing children during respiratory symptoms and after recovery. Naso- and oropharyngeal swabs were tested for rhinovirus by quantitative PCR. Breath was collected via a spacer and analysed using an electronic nose. Between-group discrimination was assessed by constructing a 1000-fold cross-validated receiver operating characteristic curve. Analyses were stratified by rhinovirus presence/absence. Wheezing children demonstrated a different VOC profile when compared with asymptomatic children (p{\textless}0.001), regardless of the presence (area under the curve (AUC) 0.77, 95{\%} CI 0.07) or absence (AUC 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.05) of rhinovirus. After symptomatic recovery, discriminative accuracy was maintained in children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze (AUC 0.84, 95{\%} CI 0.06), whereas it dropped significantly in infants with non-rhinovirus-induced wheeze (AUC 0.67, 95{\%} CI 0.06). Exhaled molecular profiles differ between preschool children with and without acute respiratory wheeze. This appears to be sustained in children with rhinovirus-induced wheeze after resolution of symptoms. Therefore, exhaled VOC may qualify as candidate biomarkers for early signs of asthma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The majority of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPCs) are associated with HPV genotype 16; however, OPC can be associated with other high-risk non-HPV16 genotypes. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with high-risk non-HPV16 OPC treated at a single tertiary institution. Sociodemographic and clinical information was obtained by chart review. HPV genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Baseline data and outcomes were compared between HPV16 and high-risk non-HPV16 groups. RESULTS: High-risk non-HPV16 genotypes accounted for 9{\%} of HPV-related OPC. Of the 27 total high-risk non-HPV16 OPCs, HPV35 was most prevalent (48{\%}). High-risk non-HPV16 OPC presented at a slightly higher age (p = .021) and higher clinical T classification (p = .008) compared to HPV16 OPC, but there was no significant survival difference. CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of high-risk non-HPV16 OPC were largely consistent with those of HPV16 OPC. Additional multi-institutional studies will be required to demonstrate conclusively that the favorable prognosis of patients with HPV16 applies to all high-risk HPV types. {\textcopyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Tumor tissue specimens from 201 OPSCC patients treated with curative intent were available for immunohistochemistry, and the samples were stained with monoclonal MMP-7 antibody. All the patients were followed up at least 3 years or until death. MMP-7 expression did not differ between HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients. MMP-7 was not prognostic among patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. In the HPV-positive subgroup, patients with moderate, high, or very high MMP-7 expression had significantly worse 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) (56.6{\%}) than patients with absent, or low MMP-7 expression (77.2{\%}), and MMP-7 expression appeared as a prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. In addition, among HPV-positive OPSCC with moderate, high, or very high MMP-7 expression, the 5-year distant recurrence-free survival was significantly lower (69.6{\%}) than in those who had low or absent MMP-7 expression (97.5{\%}). Our results suggest that among HPV-positive OPSCC patients, high MMP-7 expression is related to worse 5-year DSS and increased rate of distant recurrences.},

abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases continue to be reported, predominantly in Saudi Arabia and occasionally other countries. Although dromedaries are the main reservoir, other animal species might be susceptible to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection and potentially serve as reservoirs. To determine whether other animals are potential reservoirs, we inoculated MERS-CoV into llamas, pigs, sheep, and horses and collected nasal and rectal swab samples at various times. The presence of MERS-CoV in the nose of pigs and llamas was confirmed by PCR, titration of infectious virus, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization; seroconversion was detected in animals of both species. Conversely, in sheep and horses, virus-specific antibodies did not develop and no evidence of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was found. These results prove the susceptibility of llamas and pigs to MERS-CoV infection. Thus, the possibility of MERS-CoV circulation in animals other than dromedaries, such as llamas and pigs, is not negligible.},

abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important colonizer in animals and an opportunistic pathogen in humans. In humans, MRSA can cause infections that might be difficult to treat because of antimicrobial resistance. The use of bacteriophages has been suggested as a potential approach for the control of MRSA colonization to minimize the-often occupational-exposure of humans. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of bacteriophage treatment on porcine nasal colonization with MRSA in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. The effectiveness of a bacteriophage combination of phage K*710 and P68 was assessed in vitro by incubating them with MRSA V0608892/1 (ST398) measuring the OD600 hourly. To study the in vivo effect, bacteriophages were administered in a gel developed for human application, which contain 109 plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL (K and P68 in a 19.25:1 ratio) for 5 days to piglets (N = 8) that were experimentally colonized with the MRSA strain. Eight piglets experimentally colonized were used as a negative control. The MRSA strain was also used to colonize porcine nasal mucosa explants and bacteriophages were applied to assess the ex vivo efficacy of treatment. Bacteriophages were effective in vitro. In vivo, sixteen piglets were colonized with MRSA but the number of CFU recovered after the application of the bacteriophages in 8 piglets was not reduced compared to the control animals (approx. 105 CFU/swab). In the ex vivo model, 108 CFU were used to establish colonization with MRSA; a reduction of colonization was not observed after application of bacteriophages. However, application of mupirocin both in vivo and ex vivo resulted in a near eradication of MRSA. IN CONCLUSION: i) The MRSA strain was killed in the presence of the bacteriophages phage K*710 and P68 in vitro. ii) Bacteriophages did not reduce porcine nasal colonization in vivo or ex vivo. Physiological in vivo and ex vivo conditions may explain these observations. Efficacy in the ex vivo model matched that of the in vivo system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the role of p16(INK4a) and the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nasal vestibule. METHODS: Patients diagnosed from 1995 to 2014 were included in this study. Assessment of p16(INK4a) and HPV-DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed and analyzed with respect to baseline, clinicopathological, and outcome parameters. The p16(INK4a) positivity was defined as unequivocal nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of ≥70{\%} of the cells, whereas 50{\%}-69{\%} was considered to be a "borderline" result. RESULTS: There were 46 patients with SCCs of the nasal vestibule, of whom 31 (67.4{\%}) were available for p16(INK4a) and 30 (65.2{\%}) for analysis of HPV. Expression of p16(INK4a) was present in 19.4{\%} and showed coincidence with high-risk HPV (P {\textless} .001). Neither p16(INK4a) nor HPV-DNA had significant impact on outcome. CONCLUSION: Significant immunoreactivity for p16(INK4a) was present in about one-fifth of the samples and figured as a surrogate marker of high-risk HPV infection. There was no influence on outcome.},

abstract = {Globally, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children less than one year of age and in USA alone, between 85,000 and 144,000 infants are hospitalized every year. To date, there is no licensed vaccine. We have evaluated vaccine potential of mammalian cell-derived native RSV virus-like particles (RSV VLPs) composed of the two surface glycoproteins G and F, and the matrix protein M. Results of in vitro testing showed that the VLPs were functionally assembled and immunoreactive, and that the recombinantly expressed F protein was cleaved intracellularly similarly to the virus-synthesized F protein to produce the F1 and F2 subunits; the presence of the F1 fragment is critical for vaccine development since all the neutralizing epitopes present in the F protein are embedded in this fragment. Additional in vitro testing in human macrophage cell line THP-1 showed that both virus and the VLPs were sensed by TLR-4 and induced a Th1-biased cytokine response. Cotton rats vaccinated with RSV VLPs adjuvanted with alum and monophosphoryl lipid A induced potent neutralizing antibody response, and conferred protection in the lower as well as the upper respiratory tract based on substantial virus clearance from these sites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first VLP/virosome vaccine study reporting protection of the lower as well as the upper respiratory tract: Prevention from replication in the nose is an important consideration if the target population is infants {\textless} 6 months of age. This is because continued virus replication in the nose results in nasal congestion and babies at this age are obligate nose breathers. In conclusion, these results taken together suggest that our VLPs show promise to be a safe and effective vaccine for RSV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternally derived serum antibody and viral load are thought to influence disease severity in primary respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. As part of the AsPIRES study of RSV pathogenesis, we correlated various serum antibody concentrations and viral load with disease severity. METHODS: Serum neutralizing antibody titers and levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to RSV fusion protein (F), attachment proteins of RSV group A and B, the CX3C region of G, and nasal viral load were measured in 139 full-term previously healthy infants with primary RSV infection and correlated with illness severity. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed no relationship between measures of serum antibody and severity. However, a multivariate model adjusting for age at the time of infection found a significant 0.56 decrease in severity score for each 2-fold increase in antibody concentration to RSV F. The benefit of antibody was greatest in infants ≤ 2 months of age. Additionally, estimated antibody titer at birth was correlated with age at infection, suggesting that higher antibody titers delay infection. Viral load did not differ by illness severity. CONCLUSION: Our data support the concept of maternal immunization with an RSV vaccine during pregnancy as a strategy for reducing the burden of RSV infection in full-term healthy infants exposed to RSV during their first winter.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV-1) is an exogenous betaretrovirus of sheep that transforms epithelial cells lining the ethmoid turbinates leading to a disease called enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA). A unique feature of ENA is the apparent absence of a specific humoral immune response to the virus, despite the highly productive infection in nasal tumors. The sheep genome contains approximately 27 copies of endogenous ovine betaretroviral sequences (enJSRVs) and expression of enJSRVs in the ovine placenta and uterine endometrium throughout gestation is thought to induce immunological tolerance to exogenous ovine betaretroviruses, a factor that may influence the likelihood of exogenous ENTV infection and disease outcome. Nevertheless, we recently demonstrated the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the ENTV-1 envelope glycoprotein in sheep naturally exposed to ENTV-1. FINDINGS: Here, we employed an ENTV-1 envelope glycoprotein surface subunit specific ELISA and a virus neutralization assay to monitor serum antibody responses to ENTV-1 in a group of lambs experimentally infected with ENTV-1 virus containing filtered ENA tumor homogenate. Seroconversion and development of neutralizing antibodies was detected in one of six experimentally infected lambs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that sheep can respond immunologically and seroconvert following ENTV-1 infection suggesting that anti-viral immune responses may play a role in the development of ENA.},

abstract = {The respiratory epithelium is a barrier against pathogens and allergens and a target for therapy in respiratory allergy, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We investigated barrier-damaging factors and protective factors by real-time measurement of respiratory cell barrier integrity. Barrier integrity to cigarette smoke extract (CSE), house dust mite (HDM) extract, interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) or human rhinovirus (HRV) infection alone or in combination was assessed. Corticosteroids, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and nasal mucus proteins were tested for their ability to prevent loss of barrier integrity. Real-time impedance-based measurement revealed different patterns of CSE-, HDM-, IFN-$\gamma$- and HRV-induced damage. When per se non-damaging concentrations of harmful factors were combined, a synergetic effect was observed only for CSE and HDM. Betamethasone prevented the damaging effect of HRV and CSE, but not damage caused by HDM or IFN-$\gamma$. Real-time impedance-based measurement of respiratory epithelial barrier function is useful to study factors, which are harmful or protective. The identification of a synergetic damaging effect of CSE and HDM as well as the finding that Betamethasone protects against HRV- and CSE-induced damage may be important for asthma and COPD.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since the end of 2011 an outbreak of pseudorabies affected Chinese pig herds that had been vaccinated with the commercial vaccine made of Bartha K61 strain. It is now clear that the outbreak was caused by an emergent PRV variant. Even though vaccines made of PRV Bartha K61 strain can confer certain cross protection against PRV variants based on experimental data, less than optimal clinical protection and virus shedding reduction were observed, making the control or eradication of this disease difficult. RESULTS: An infectious clone of PRV AH02LA strain was constructed to generate a gE deletion mutant PRV(LA-A(B)) strain. PRV(LA-A(B)) strain can reach a titer of 10(8.43) TCID(50) /mL (50{\%} tissue culture infectious dose) on BHK-21 cells. To evaluate the efficiency of the inactivated vaccine made of PRV(LA-A(B)) strain, thirty 3-week-old PRV-negative piglets were divided randomly into six groups for vaccination and challenge test. All five piglets in the challenge control showed typical clinical symptoms of pseudorabies post challenge. Sneezing and nasal discharge were observed in four and three piglets in groups C(vaccinated with inactivated PRV Bartha K61 strain vaccine) and D(vaccinated with live PRV Bartha K61 strain vaccine) respectively. In contrast, piglets in both groups A(vaccinated with inactivated PRV LA-AB strain vaccine) and B(vaccinated with inactivated PRV LA-A(B) strain vaccine with adjuvant) presented mild or no clinical symptoms. Moreover, viral titers detected via nasal swabs were approximately 100 times lower in group B than in the challenge control, and the duration of virus shedding (3-4 days) was shorter than in either the challenge control (5-10 days) or groups C and D (5-6 days). CONCLUSIONS: The infectious clone constructed in this study harbors the whole genome of the PRV variant AH02LA strain. The gE deletion mutant PRV(LA-A(B))strain generated from PRV AH02LA strain can reach a high titer on BHK-21 cells. An inactivated vaccine of PRV LA-A(B) provides clinical protection and significantly reduces virus shedding post challenge, especially if accompanied by the adjuvant CVC1302. While Inactivated or live vaccines made of PRV Barth K61 strain can provide only partial protection in this test.},

Method:Fifty-five cases of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma were collected,twenty cases of nasal in-verted papilloma and twenty cases of nasal polyp were chose as control. The expression of P16 and infection of HPV16 were detected by immunohistochemistry in both experimental group and control group. Result:The positive rate of P16 and HPV16 in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma and nasal in-verted papilloma were significantly higher than it in nasal polyp (P{\textless}0.05 or P{\textless}0.01). The expression of P16 was correlated with tumor differentiation and clinical TNM stages (P{\textless}0.05), but was not associated with age, sex, smoking and the primary tumor site (P{\textgreater}0.05). HPV16 infection has no statistical relationship with analysis factors (P{\textgreater}0.05). There was a positive correlation between P16 expression an HPV16 infection in the cases of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (r=0.483, P{\textless}0.01). Survival curves showed that the expression of P16 and infection of HPV16 were positively associated with prognosis of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, Log Rank test showed a significant difference (P{\textless}0.05). Conclusion:The abnormal expression of P16 and HPV16 infection play an important role in the development of sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. The two may had a synergistic effect. P16/HPV16 positive cases had better prognosis.},

abstract = {Intranasal administration could be an attractive alternative route of administration for the delivery of drugs to the central nervous system (CNS). However, there are always doubts about the direct transport of therapeutics from nasal cavity to the CNS since there are only limited studies on the understanding of direct nose-to-brain transport. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) investigate the existence of nose-to-brain transport of intranasally administered HIV-1 replication inhibitor DB213 and (2) assess the direct nose-to-brain transport of unbound HIV-1 replication inhibitor DB213 quantitatively by a pharmacokinetic approach. Plasma samples were collected up to 6 h post-dosing after administration via intranasal or intravenous route at three bolus doses. In the brain-uptake study, the plasma, whole brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sampled between 15 min and 8 h post-dosing. All samples were analyzed with LC/MS/MS. Plasma, CSF, and brain concentration versus time profiles were analyzed with nonlinear mixed-effect modeling. Structural model building was performed by NONMEM (version VII, level 2.0). Intranasal administration showed better potential to deliver HIV-1 replication inhibitor DB213 to the brain with 290-fold higher brain to plasma ratio compared with intravenous administration. Based on that, a model with two absorption compartments (nose-to-systemic circulation and nose-to-brain) was developed and demonstrated 72.4{\%} of total absorbed unbound HIV-1 replication inhibitor DB213 after intranasal administration was transported directly into the brain through nose-to-brain pathway.},

abstract = {Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is associated with poor prognosis. To improve prognostication, we analyzed four gene probes (TERC, CCND1, EGFR and TP53) and the centromere probe CEP4 as a marker of chromosomal instability, using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in single cells from the tumors of sixty-five OTSCC patients (Stage I, n = 15; Stage II, n = 30; Stage III, n = 7; Stage IV, n = 13). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the FISH data distinguished three clusters related to smoking status. Copy number increases of all five markers were found to be correlated to non-smoking habits, while smokers in this cohort had low-level copy number gains. Using the phylogenetic modeling software FISHtrees, we constructed models of tumor progression for each patient based on the four gene probes. Then, we derived test statistics on the models that are significant predictors of disease-free and overall survival, independent of tumor stage and smoking status in multivariate analysis. The patients whose tumors were modeled as progressing by a more diverse distribution of copy number changes across the four genes have poorer prognosis. This is consistent with the view that multiple genetic pathways need to become deregulated in order for cancer to progress.},

The present study analyzed for the first time PI animals derived from a controlled infection with two different 'HoBi'-like strains where the animals were maintained under conditions where superinfection by other pestiviruses could be excluded. The sequence of the region coding for viral glycoproteins E1/E2 of variants within the swarms of viruses present in the PI calves and two viral inoculums used to generate them were compared. Differences in genetic composition of the viral swarms were observed suggesting that host factors can play a role in genetic variations among PIs. Moreover, PIs generated with the same inoculum showed amino acid substitutions in similar sites of the polyprotein, even in serum from PIs with different quasispecies composition, reinforcing that some specific sites in E2 are important for host adaptation.},

abstract = {CONTRIBUTION TO EMERGENCY NURSING PRACTICE: PROBLEM: Rapid diagnosis of seasonal influenza leads to optimized clinical care and reduces the spread of infection. The collection of adequate cellular material can be facilitated by the presence of moisture in the nares. The specific aim of this project was to determine if the installation of sterile saline into the nares prior to specimen collection would improve the quality of the specimen. METHODS: This quasi-experimental single group design tested an initial "dry swab" specimen against a second swab after instillation of sterile saline solution using a nasal atomizer, a "wet swab." RESULTS: A total of 80 paired specimens were collected and analyzed between December 7, 2015, and April 21, 2016, with an 11.25{\%} infection rate in those tested. Of 9 positive tests, 6 subjects tested positive for influenza A or B for both the dry swab and the wet swab. Three subjects tested positive for influenza A or B for only the wet swab, and these subjects had experienced their symptoms longer than did subjects who tested positive for both methods (mean symptom onset of 72 hours vs 66 hours). We found an important inconsistency between manufacturers' recommendations and typical hospital practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The results appear somewhat equivocal. Because viral shedding declines after the first 48 to 72 hours in adults, the wet swab method may be clinically superior for detecting influenza in adults presenting later in the course of their illness. Hospital policy was revised for consistency in using the gel medium before sampling in accordance with manufacturer recommendations.},

abstract = {Since 2013, avian influenza viruses of subtype H7N9 have been transmitted from poultry to humans in China and caused severe disease. Concerns persist over the pandemic potential of this virus and further understanding of immunity and transmission is required. The isogenic guinea pig model uniquely would allow for investigation into both. Eighteen female isogenic guinea pigs 12-16 weeks were inoculated intratracheally with either A/H7N9 virus (n=12) or PBS (n=6) and sacrificed on days 2 and 7 post-inoculation. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs were taken daily to assess viral replication kinetics and necropsies were performed to study pathogenesis. All animals showed peak virus titers in nasal secretions at day 2 post-inoculation and by day 7 post-inoculation infectious virus titers had decreased to just above detectable levels. At day 2, high virus titers were found in nasal turbinates and lungs and moderate titers in trachea and cerebrum. At day 7, infectious virus was detected in the nasal turbinates only. Histology showed moderate to severe inflammation in the entire respiratory tract and immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated large numbers of viral antigen positive cells in the nasal epithelium at day 2 and fewer at day 7 post-inoculation. A moderate number of IHC positive cells was observed in the bronchi(oli) and alveoli at day 2 only. This study indicates that isogenic guinea pigs are a promising model to further study immunity to and transmission of H7N9 influenza virus.},

abstract = {Heterosubtypic immunity is defined as immune-mediated (partial) protection against an influenza virus induced by an influenza virus of another subtype to which the host has not previously been exposed. This cross-protective effect has not yet been demonstrated to the newly emerging avian influenza A viruses of the H7N9 subtype. Here, we assessed the induction of protective immunity to these viruses by infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in a newly developed guinea pig model. To this end, ten female 12-16 week old strain 2 guinea pigs were inoculated intratracheally with either A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus or PBS (unprimed controls) followed 4 weeks later with an A/H7N9 influenza virus challenge. Nasal swabs were taken daily and animals from both groups were sacrificed on days 2 and 7 post inoculation (p.i.) with A/H7N9 virus and full necropsies were performed. Nasal virus excretion persisted until day 7 in unprimed control animals, whereas only two out of seven H1N1pdm09-primed animals excreted virus via the nose. Infectious virus was recovered from nasal turbinates, trachea and lung of all animals at day 2 p.i., but titers were lower for H1N1pdm09-primed animals, especially in the nasal turbinates. By day 7 p.i., relatively high virus titers were found in the nasal turbinates of all unprimed control animals but infectious virus was isolated from the nose of only one of four H1N1pdm09-primed animals. Animals of both groups developed inflammation of variable severity in the entire respiratory tract. Viral antigen positive cells were demonstrated in the nasal epithelium of both groups at day 2. The bronchi(oli) and alveoli of unprimed animals showed a moderate to strong positive signal at day 2, whereas H1N1pdm09-primed animals showed only minimal positivity. By day 7, only viral antigen positive cells were found after H7N9 virus infection in the nasal turbinates and the lungs of unprimed controls. Thus infection with H1N1pdm09 virus induced partially protective heterosubtypic immunity to H7N9 virus in (isogenic) guinea pigs that could not be attributed to cross-reactive virus neutralizing antibodies.},

abstract = {To elucidate the pathogenesis and transmission of influenza virus, the ferret model is typically used. To investigate protective immune responses, the use of inbred mouse strains has proven invaluable. Here, we describe a study with isogenic guinea pigs, which would uniquely combine the advantages of the mouse and ferret models for influenza virus infection. Strain 2 isogenic guinea pigs were inoculated with H1N1pdm09 influenza virus A/Netherlands/602/09 by the intranasal or intratracheal route. Viral replication kinetics were assessed by determining virus titers in nasal swabs and respiratory tissues, which were also used to assess histopathologic changes and the number of infected cells. In all guinea pigs, virus titers peaked in nasal secretions at day 2 after inoculation. Intranasal inoculation resulted in higher virus excretion via the nose and higher virus titers in the nasal turbinates than intratracheal inoculation. After intranasal inoculation, infectious virus was recovered only from nasal epithelium; after intratracheal inoculation, it was recovered also from trachea, lung, and cerebrum. Histopathologic changes corresponded with virus antigen distribution, being largely limited to nasal epithelium for intranasally infected guinea pigs and more widespread in the respiratory tract for intratracheally infected guinea pigs. In summary, isogenic guinea pigs show promise as a model to investigate the role of humoral and cell-mediated immunities to influenza and their effect on virus transmission.},

abstract = {Olfactory dysfunction is a pervasive but underappreciated health concern that affects personal safety and quality of life. Patients with olfactory dysfunctions have limited therapeutic options, particularly those involving congenital diseases. Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is one such disorder, where olfactory loss and other symptoms manifest from defective cilium morphology and/or function in various cell types/tissues. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of BBS mutant mice lack the capacity to build/maintain cilia, rendering the cells incapable of odor detection. Here we examined OSN cilium defects in Bbs1 mutant mice and assessed the utility of gene therapy to restore ciliation and function in young and adult mice. Bbs1 mutant mice possessed short residual OSN cilia in which BBSome protein trafficking and odorant detection were defective. Gene therapy with an adenovirus-delivered wild-type Bbs1 gene restored OSN ciliation, corrected BBSome cilium trafficking defects, and returned acute odor responses. Finally, using clinically approved AAV serotypes, we demonstrate, for the first time, the capacity of AAVs to restore ciliation and odor detection in OSNs of Bbs1 mutants. Together, our data demonstrate that OSN ciliogenesis can be promoted in differentiated cells of young and adult Bbs1 mutants and highlight the potential of gene therapy as a viable restorative treatment for congenital olfactory disorders.},

abstract = {The equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) ORF1 and ORF71 genes have immune modulatory effects in vitro. Experimental infection of horses using virus mutants with multiple deletions including ORF1 and ORF71 showed promise as vaccine candidates against EHV-1. Here, the combined effects of ORF1 and ORF71 deletions from the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 on clinical disease and host immune response were further explored. Three groups of EHV-1 na{\"{i}}ve horses were experimentally infected with the ORF1/71 gene deletion mutant (Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71), the parent Ab4 strain, or remained uninfected. In comparison to Ab4, horses infected with Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 did not show the initial high fever peak characteristic of EHV-1 infection. Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 infection had reduced nasal shedding (1/5 vs. 5/5) and, simultaneously, decreased intranasal interferon (IFN)-$\alpha$, interleukin (IL)-10 and soluble CD14 secretion. However, Ab4 and Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 infection resulted in comparable viremia, suggesting these genes do not regulate the infection of the mononuclear cells and subsequent viremia. Intranasal and serum anti-EHV-1 antibodies to Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 developed slightly slower than those to Ab4. However, beyond day 12 post infection (d12pi) serum antibodies in both virus-infected groups were similar and remained increased until the end of the study (d114pi). EHV-1 immunoglobulin (Ig) G isotype responses were dominated by short-lasting IgG1 and long-lasting IgG4/7 antibodies. The IgG4/7 response closely resembled the total EHV-1 specific antibody response. Ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMC with Ab4 resulted in IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-10 secretion by cells from both infected groups within two weeks pi. Flow cytometric analysis showed that IFN-$\gamma$ producing EHV-1-specific T-cells were mainly CD8+/IFN-$\gamma$+ and detectable from d32pi on. Peripheral blood IFN-$\gamma$+ T-cell percentages were similar in both infected groups, albeit at low frequency ({\~{}}0.1{\%}). In summary, the Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 gene deletion mutant is less virulent but induced antibody responses and cellular immunity similar to the parent Ab4 strain.},

abstract = {The influenza A virus components of the live, attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) encode the HA and NA gene segments from a circulating virus strain and the remaining gene segments from the cold-adapted master donor virus, A/Ann Arbor/6/1960 (H2N2). The master donor virus imparts at least three phenotypes: temperature-sensitivity (ts), attenuation (att), and cold-adaption (ca). The genetic loci responsible for the att and ts phenotypes of LAIV were mapped to PB1, PB2, and NP by reverse genetics experiments using immortalized cell lines. However, some in vivo studies have demonstrated that the M segment, which acquired an alanine (Ala) to serine (Ser) mutation at M2 position 86 during cold adaption - a mutation found in no other influenza A virus strain - contributes to the att phenotype. Prior studies have shown this region of the M2 cytoplasmic tail to be critical for influenza virus replication. Using reverse genetics, we demonstrate that certain amino acid substitutions at M2 positions 83 and 86 alter the replication of influenza A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2). Importantly, substitution of a Ser at M2 position 86 reduces A/Udorn/307/72 replication in differentiated primary human nasal epithelial cell (hNECs) cultures, but does not considerably affect replication in MDCK cells. When a Ser was substituted for Ala at M2 86 in LAIV, the virus replicated to higher titers and with faster kinetics in hNEC cultures, implicating this amino acid change as contributing to LAIV attenuation. Increased replication also resulted in increased production of IFN-$\lambda$. These data indicate the LAIV associated Ser mutation at M2 position 86 contributes to the att phenotype and is associated with a differential regulation of interferon in LAIV infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. While the majority of infants display only mild upper respiratory tract infection or occasionally otitis media, around one-third will develop an infection of the lower respiratory tract, usually bronchiolitis. There is now convincing evidence from a number of cohorts that respiratory syncytial virus is a significant, independent risk factor for later wheezing, at least within the first decade of life. The wide variation in response to respiratory syncytial virus infection suggests that susceptibility and disease are influenced by multiple host-intrinsic factors. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old white girl presented to our Pediatric Allergy Clinic with recurrent crackles in addition to cough, fevers, and labored breathing since her first respiratory syncytial virus infection at the age of 7 months. She had been under the care of pulmonologists, who suspected childhood interstitial lung disease. She was hospitalized eight times due to exacerbation of symptoms and prescribed systemic and inhaled steroids, short-acting $\beta$2-mimetics, and antileukotriene. There was no short-term clinical improvement at that time between hospitalizations. During her hospital stay at the Pneumonology and Cystic Fibrosis Department in Rabka a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Laboratory bacteriological tests found high colony count of Moraxella catarrhalis ($\beta$-lactamase positive), sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, in bronchial secretions and swabs from her nose. After this, infections were treated with antibiotics; she remained in good condition without symptoms. Crackles and wheezing recurred only during symptoms of infections. Therefore, we hypothesize that respiratory syncytial virus infection at an early age might cause severe damage of the lung epithelium and prolonged clinical symptoms, mainly crackles and wheezing, each time the child has a respiratory infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the importance of respiratory syncytial virus infection in an immunocompetent child. Pediatricians need to have a high index of suspicion and knowledge of recurrent symptoms associated with severe damage of the lung epithelium to establish the correct diagnosis.},

Laboratory studies using molecular RT-PCR biology methods for detection of genetic material of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses were performed by Voivodeship Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations in Poland. The validation of the results of swabs taken from the nose and throat were carried out in the Department of Influenza Research, National Influenza Center in Warsaw. The study involved 210 samples from patients across Poland. Positive results were recorded for 72.4 {\%} of the samples; influenza virus type A was detected in 43 and type B in 38 cases, whereas in 71 cases other respiratory viruses were detected, which included Human parainfluenza virus type 1-4; Human respiratory syncytial virus type A and B; Human coronavirus 229E/NL63, OC43; Human rhinovirus type A, B, and C; Human enterovirus; and Human adenovirus. The results show that although influenza viruses predominated in the 2010/2011 season in Poland, other flu-like viruses also abounded.},

The article presents research conducted on the basis of swabs collected from patients who came to the Ear, Nose, and Throat Emergency Care Unit at the Department of Otolaryngology, Military Medical Institute in Warsaw, in February 2013. Due to the nature of work in an laryngological emergency ward, the material was collected only from those patients who reported problems associated with rhinitis or any dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract. The study shows that patients who came to seek laryngological assistance were usually infected with viruses having affinity for the airway epithelium.},

abstract = {Even in the vaccine era, Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) remains a leading cause of otitis media, a significant public health burden, in large part because of the high prevalence of nasal colonization with the pneumococcus in children. The primary pneumococcal neuraminidase, NanA, which is a sialidase that catalyzes the cleavage of terminal sialic acids from host glycoconjugates, is involved in both of these processes. Coinfection with influenza A virus, which also expresses a neuraminidase, exacerbates nasal colonization and disease by S. pneumoniae, in part via the synergistic contributions of the viral neuraminidase. The specific role of its pneumococcal counterpart, NanA, in this interaction, however, is less well understood. We demonstrate in a mouse model that NanA-deficient pneumococci are impaired in their ability to cause both nasal colonization and middle ear infection. Coinfection with neuraminidase-expressing influenza virus and S. pneumoniae potentiates both colonization and infection but not to wild-type levels, suggesting an intrinsic role of NanA. Using in vitro models, we show that while NanA contributes to both epithelial adherence and biofilm viability, its effect on the latter is actually independent of its sialidase activity. These data indicate that NanA contributes both enzymatically and nonenzymatically to pneumococcal pathogenesis and, as such, suggest that it is not a redundant bystander during coinfection with influenza A virus. Rather, its expression is required for the full synergism between these two pathogens.},

abstract = {Nerve growth factor (NGF) is expressed in the human corneal epithelium and stroma. It is an efficient therapy for human corneal ulcers caused by neurotropic disease. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of NGF in healing human corneal epithelial diseases. Numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) are expressed in the cornea and miRNAs have important roles in regulating corneal development. In the present study, novel miRNA regulators were demonstrated to be involved in NGF‑induced human corneal epithelial cell (hCEC) proliferation. NGF treatment significantly downregulated the expression of miRNA‑494 in hCECs in vitro. Furthermore, miRNA‑494 increased G1 arrest in the immortalized human corneal epithelial cell (ihCEC) line and suppressed cell proliferation. Accordingly, bioinformatics programs and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miRNA‑494 directly targeted cyclin D1 by binding to a sequence in the 3'‑untranslated region. In addition, overexpression of miRNA‑494 decreased both basal and NGF‑induced cyclin D1 expression. NGF treatment partially suppressed miRNA‑494 expression and restored cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, co‑transfection of miRNA‑494 with the cyclin D1 ORF clone partially restored cyclin D1 mRNA and protein expression. These findings indicate that miRNA‑494 and its target cyclin D1 may be a crucial axis for NGF in regulating the proliferation of hCEC. Specific modulation of miRNA‑494 in hCEC could represent an attractive approach for treating cornea epithelial diseases.},

abstract = {Influenza viral infections are significant global public health concerns due to the morbidity and mortality associated with acute respiratory disease, secondary complications, and pandemic threats; thus, continuous efforts have been made to develop potent influenza vaccines. In this study, 3 different mucosal adjuvants-alkyl polyglycoside (APG), gellan gum, and chitosan (CS)-were evaluated for their efficacy in intranasal A/H1N1 or B split influenza vaccines administered to BALB/c mice. Protective immunity was monitored by serum analysis for IgG, hemagglutination inhibition (HI), and neutralizing antibody levels, as well as mucosal IgA levels in nasal and pulmonary lavage fluids. Survival, body weight, lung viral titer, and pulmonary immunopathology were also examined following lethal influenza challenge. Notably, all adjuvants amplified the IgG and IgA immune responses (not detected in immunization of influenza B) and increased survival rate compared with controls administered adjuvant-free intranasal vaccines. Alternatively, intramuscular immunization stimulated IgG production, but had no effect on IgA levels. Our collective analysis identified that APG was the most effective intranasal adjuvant, as all mice survived influenza challenge with limited body weight loss, viral titer, and pulmonary pathology, similar to those observed with intramuscular vaccination. This evidence supports that APG can elicit both systemic and mucosal immunity, and may be an effective adjuvant in intranasal split influenza A/H1N1 and B vaccines.},

Human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) has been tested in human influenza vaccine clinical trials and has exhibited a reliable safety profile. Here, we generated a replication-defective, recombinant adenovirus (designated as rAd5-avH1HA) expressing the hemagglutinin gene of an avian-like H1N1 virus (A/swine/Zhejiang/199/2013, ZJ/199/13). Using a BALB/c mouse model, we showed that a two-dose intramuscular administration of recombinant rAd5-avH1HA induced high levels of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies and prevented homologous and heterologous H1N1 virus-induced weight loss, as well as viral replication in the nasal turbinates and lungs of mice. Furthermore, a prime-boost immunization strategy trial with a recombinant plasmid (designated as pCAGGS-HA) followed by rAd5-avH1HA vaccine provided effective protection against homologous and heterologous H1N1 virus infection in mice. These results indicate that rAd5-avH1HA is an efficacious genetically engineered vaccine candidate against H1N1 swine influenza. Future studies should examine its immune efficacy in pigs.},

abstract = {Currently, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections have been studied extensively in inbred mice via intraperitoneal route with highly passaged strains. However, the question how a low-passage MCMV replicates in inbred mice via a natural route remained unanswered. Here, different inbred mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6 and NOD) were inoculated oronasally with a low-passage MCMV strain, HaNa1. Viral replication was evaluated by virus titration and quantitative real-time PCR, and antibody response was assessed by immunoperoxidase cell monolayer assay (IPMA). In BALB/c mice, virus persisted in nasal mucosa (from 3 dpi) and submandibular glands (from 7 dpi) until the end of experiment (49 dpi). In C57BL/6 mice, infectious virus was only detected in nasal mucosa from 3 dpi until 21 dpi; viral genome was still detectable in nasal mucosa until 49 dpi. Although infectious virus was not detected in submandibular glands of C57BL/6 mice, viral genome was detected from 7 dpi until 49 dpi. NOD mice appeared to be even more resistant with absence of any productive infection; viral genome was detected at low levels in nasal mucosa. We demonstrated that there was a strong correlation between on the one hand degree of productive replication and on the other hand the time of first appearance and titer of MCMV-specific IgG antibody. The deficiency of functional T and B cells and interleukin-2 (IL-2) common-$\gamma$ chain ($\gamma$c) did not increase the susceptibility to MCMV by the use of NOD.SCID and NSG mice. In addition, using monocytic cells from different inbred mice we found patterns of resistance similar to those seen in vivo, as assessed by viral antigen expression. Taken together, these results demonstrated that upon oronasal inoculation low-passage MCMV HaNa1 replication clearly differs between different inbred mice (BALB/c{\textgreater}C57BL/6{\textgreater}NOD); resistance in vivo to MCMV is partly due to less susceptibility of host target cells and is independent of T, B cells and $\gamma$c signaling cytokine-dependent NK cell activities.},

Animal models mimicking the natural primary HCMV infections in infants and adults are scarce. Here, neonatal and adult BALB/c mice were inoculated oronasally with a Belgian isolate HaNa1 of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). None of the mice showed clinical symptoms. In neonatal mice, a typical systemic infection occurred. In adult mice, viral replication was restricted to the nasal mucosa and submandibular glands. Infectious virus was not detected in trachea, oral mucosa, pharynx, esophagus, small intestines of both neonatal and adult mice at all time points. Nose was demonstrated to be the entry site. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that in nose infected cells were olfactory neurons and sustentacular cells in olfactory epithelium and were macrophages and dendritic cells in nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT). Neonatal and adult mice developed similar antibody response pattern, though former magnitude was lower. In summary, we have established intranasal (without anesthesia) infections of neonatal and adult mice with murine CMV HaNa1 strain, which mimic the range and extent of virus replication during natural primary HCMV infections in healthy infants and adults. These findings might bring new insights in the pathogenesis of natural primary CMV infections.},

abstract = {The PA-X protein is a fusion protein incorporating the N-terminal 191 amino acids of the PA protein with a short C-terminal sequence encoded by an overlapping ORF (X-ORF) in segment 3 that is accessed by + 1 ribosomal frameshifting, and this X-ORF exists in either full length or a truncated form (either 61-or 41-condons). Genetic evolution analysis indicates that all swine influenza viruses (SIVs) possessed full-length PA-X prior to 1985, but since then SIVs with truncated PA-X have gradually increased and become dominant, implying that truncation of this protein may contribute to the adaptation of influenza virus in pigs. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed PA-X extended viruses in the background of a "triple-reassortment" H1N2 SIV with truncated PA-X, and evaluated their biological characteristics in vitro and in vivo. Compared with full-length PA-X, SIV with truncated PA-X had increased viral replication in porcine cells and swine respiratory tissues, along with enhanced pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs. Furthermore, we found that truncation of PA-X improved the inhibition of IFN-I mRNA expression. Hereby, our results imply that truncation of PA-X may contribute to the adaptation of SIV in pigs.},

abstract = {Serological surveys have shown that wild raccoons are exposed to influenza A viruses (IAVs); however, no genetic evidence for this IAV infection has been found. In the present study, we first detected IAV genes in wild raccoons captured during periods other than the wintering season of migratory waterfowl and epidemic season of influenza in Japan. Viral matrix (M) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes were detected by a conventional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay from three suckling siblings and one juvenile without any noticeable clinical signs, although the NP gene could not be detected from one sibling. The sequences of M gene fragments detected from the rectal swabs of three suckling siblings were comparable with each other but different from those detected from the nasal swab of the juvenile raccoon caught from a different site. The sequences of NP gene fragments detected from two suckling siblings were also comparable. These genetic evidences suggest that IAV is maintained among raccoon populations in the northern part of Japan. Further genetic and virological investigation of IAV infection in wild raccoons is needed to better understand the IAV ecology in the field.},

abstract = {Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL) is a subtype of mature T- and natural killer cell lymphomas characterized by its association with Epstein-Barr virus and extranodal involvement. Although there is geographic variance in the frequency of ENKL, its clinical features are similar between Western countries and endemic areas, such as East Asia. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy is not recommended to treat ENKL. No standard treatment has been established based on the results of randomized controlled trials. In patients with localized disease, radiotherapy is a core component of the recommended first-line therapy. Radiotherapy administered at 50 to 54 Gy, extended involved-site radiotherapy considering tumor invasiveness, and the use of intensity modulated radiation therapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy are associated with efficacy of radiotherapy. Although the use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been supported by the results of clinical trials, accumulating evidence supports the use of sequential chemoradiotherapy with non-anthracycline-containing regimens that include l-asparaginase and/or platinum anticancer agents. l-asparaginase-containing chemotherapy is a key component of first-line treatments for systemic ENKL. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended as a front-line consolidation therapy for newly diagnosed advanced-stage ENKL.

abstract = {Increased viral replication and cytokine production may be associated with the pathogenesis of asthma attacks in rhinovirus (RV) infections. However, the association between increased RV replication and enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a receptor for a major RV group, in airway epithelial cells has remained unclear. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of mucolytics, which have clinical benefits in asthmatic subjects, are uncertain. Human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells were infected with type 14 rhinovirus (RV14), a major RV group. RV14 titers and cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8, in supernatants, RV14 RNA replication and susceptibility to RV14 infection were higher in HNE cells obtained from subjects in the allergic group (allergic subjects) than in those from subjects in the non-allergic group (non-allergic subjects). ICAM-1 expression and the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes from which RV14 RNA enters the cytoplasm were higher in HNE cells from allergic subjects, though substantial amounts of interferon (IFN)-$\gamma$ and IFN-$\lambda$ were not detected in the supernatant. The abundance of p50 and p65 subunits of transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) in nuclear extracts of the cells from allergic subjects was higher compared to non-allergic subjects, and an inhibitor of NF-$\kappa$B, caffeic acid phenethyl ester, reduced the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes as well as RV titers and RNA. Furthermore, a mucolytic agent, L-carbocisteine, reduced RV14 titers and RNA levels, cytokine release, ICAM-1 expression, the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes, and NF-$\kappa$B activation. The increased RV14 replication observed in HNE cells from allergic subjects might be partly associated with enhanced ICAM-1 expression and decreased endosomal pH through NF-$\kappa$B activation. L-Carbocisteine inhibits RV14 infection by reducing ICAM-1 and acidic endosomes and may, therefore, modulate airway inflammation caused by RV infection in allergic subjects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal cancer is endemic in a few well-defined populations. The prognosis for advanced nasopharyngeal cancer is poor, but early-stage disease is curable and a high survival rate can be achieved. Screening for early-stage disease could lead to improved outcomes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology and nasopharyngoscopy are most commonly used for screening. The efficacy and true benefit of screening remain uncertain due to potential selection, lead-time and length-time biases. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of screening of asymptomatic individuals by EBV serology and/or nasopharyngoscopy in reducing the mortality of nasopharyngeal cancer compared to no screening. To assess the impact of screening for nasopharyngeal cancer on incidence, survival, adverse effects, cost-effectiveness and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group (CENTDG) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CENTDG Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 6); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 6 July 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) and controlled clinical trials (CCT) evaluating screening for nasopharyngeal cancer versus no screening. Randomisation either by clusters or individuals was acceptable. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome measure was nasopharyngeal cancer-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes were incidence of nasopharyngeal cancer by stage and histopathological classification at diagnosis, survival (two-year, three-year, five-year and 10-year), harms of screening (physical and psychosocial), quality of life (via validated tools such as the SF-36 and patient satisfaction), cost-effectiveness and all-cause mortality. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no trials that met the review inclusion criteria. We retrieved 31 full-text studies for further investigation following the search. However, none met the eligibility criteria for a RCT or CCT investigation on the efficacy of screening for nasopharyngeal cancer. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No data from RCTs or CCTs are available to allow us to determine the efficacy of screening for nasopharyngeal cancer, or the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of a screening strategy. High-quality studies with long-term follow-up of mortality and cost-effectiveness are needed.},

METHODS: The serum EBNA1 and LMP1 were detected by real-time PCR in 36 ENKL patients hospitalized in Beijing Tongren Hospital from August 2010 to August 2013. Twenty healthy volunteers were recruited as controls. RESULTS: The median serum EBNA1 was 1.9×10(4) (ranged from 0 to 11.0×10(4)) copies/µl in ENKL patients and 8.0 (ranged from 0 to 43.8) copies/µl in healthy volunteers. The median serum LMP1 was 3.9×10(3) (ranged from 118.3 to 24.0×10(3)) copies/µl in ENKL patients and 3.3 (ranged from 0 to 33.3) copies/µl in healthy volunteers. Both EBNA1 and LMP1 were higher in ENKL patients than healthy volunteers (all P {\textless} 0.01). The median EBNA1 and LMP1 in ENKL patients posttreatment were 1.0×10(3) (ranged from 0 to 2.0 × 10(3)) copies/µl and 300.8 (ranged from 0 to 825.7) copies/µl respectively, which were both significantly decreased than pretreatment (all P {\textless} 0.05). The EBNA1 and LMP1 were decreased in effective treatment group versus ineffective treatment group (P {\textless} 0.05). The serum EBNA1 and LMP1 were positively correlated with lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level (r = 0.364,0.546; P = 0.040,0.012). CONCLUSIONS: (1) The measurement of EBNA1/LMP1 may be useful in evaluating the therapeutic effect. (2) The serum EBNA1/LMP1 may reflect the tumor load in ENKL patients.},

We assessed influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons in Israel, for the first time. Methods: Combined nose and throat swab specimens were collected from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) presenting to sentinel primary care clinics and tested for influenza virus by RT-PCR. VE of the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) was assessed using test-negative case-control design. Results: During the 2014/15 season 1,142 samples were collected; 327 (28.6{\%}) were positive for influenza, 83.8{\%} A(H3N2), 5.8{\%} A(H1N1)pdm09, 9.2{\%} B and 1.2{\%} A un-subtyped. Adjusted VE against all influenza viruses for this influenza season was -4.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): -54.8 to 29.0) and against influenza A(H3N2), it was -15.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: -72.8 to 22.4). For the 2015/16 season, 1,919 samples were collected; 853 (44.4{\%}) were positive for influenza, 43.5{\%} A(H1N1)pdm09, 57{\%} B, 0.7{\%} A(H3N2) and 11 samples positive for both A(H1N1)pdm09 and B. Adjusted VE against all influenza viruses for this influenza season was 8.8{\%} (95{\%} CI: -25.1 to 33.5), against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, it was 32.3{\%} (95{\%} CI: (-4.3 to 56.1) and against influenza B, it was -2.2{\%} (95{\%} CI: (-47.0 to 29.0). Conclusions: Using samples from patients with ILI visiting sentinel clinics in Israel, we demonstrated the feasibility of influenza VE estimation in Israel.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromogenic Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER) in situ hybridization (EBER-ISH) is the gold standard to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) but it is difficult to use in conjunction with immunohistochemistry (IHC). In this study, our purpose was to validate the sensitivity and specificity of RNAscope in detection of EBV infection in nasal epithelium and its stroma. METHODS: Fluorescence-based RNAscope EBER-ISH, BRLF1-ISH, and lineage marker-IHC were performed on archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from normal nasal cavity (n = 5), nasopharynx (n = 8), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) specimens (n = 10). RESULTS: The EBERs were detected in 10 of 10 NPC samples but was absent in all normal tissues from the nasal cavity and nasopharynx. The EBERs were exclusively located in pan-cytokeratin (pan-CK)-positive tumor epithelial cells but not in CD45-positive leukocytes and vimentin-positive stromal fibroblasts. The level of EBER expression varied in tumor cells within patient and between patients as well. Additionally, 5 of 10 patients had positive BRLF-ISH. CONCLUSION: We developed a simple and reproducible method to simultaneously detect mRNA and protein in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of NPC. As a single staining, traditional EBER continues to be useful; however, for interpretation of the phenotype of EBV-infected cells, RNAscope is superior. Significantly, we showed that lytic EBV infection took place in NPC tumors.},

Direct contact between infected and uninfected cattle is thought to be one of the risk factors for BLV transmission. Contact transmission occurs via a mixture of natural sources, blood, and exudates. To confirm that BLV provirus is detectable in these samples, matched blood, nasal secretion, and saliva samples were collected from 50 cattle, and genomic DNA was extracted. BLV-CoCoMo-qPCR-2, an assay developed for the highly sensitive detection of BLV, was then used to measure the proviral load in blood (n=50), nasal secretions (n=48), and saliva (n=47) samples. The results showed that 35 blood samples, 14 nasal secretion samples, and 6 saliva samples were positive for the BLV provirus. Matched blood samples from cattle that were positive for the BLV provirus (either in nasal secretion or saliva samples) were also positive in their blood. The proviral load in the positive blood samples was {\textgreater}14,000 (copies/1×10(5) cells). Thus, even though the proviral load in the nasal secretion and saliva samples was much lower ({\textless}380 copies/1×10(5) cells) than that in the peripheral blood, prolonged direct contact between infected and healthy cattle may be considered as a risk factor for BLV transmission.},

However, the molecular detection of the virus has never been reported before in UAE. Of the 7,803 nasal swabs tested in the epidemiological survey, MERS-CoV nucleic acid was detected by real-time PCR in a total of 126 (1.6 {\%}) camels. Positive camels were detected at the borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and in camels' slaughter houses. MERS-CoV partial sequences obtained from UAE camels were clustering with human- and camel-derived MERS-CoV sequences in the same geographic area.

abstract = {Equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5) infection is associated with pulmonary fibrosis in horses, but further studies on EHV-5 persistence in equine cells are needed to fully understand viral and host contributions to disease pathogenesis. Our aim was to develop a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to measure EHV-5 viral copy number in equine cell cultures, blood lymphocytes, and nasal swabs of horses. Furthermore, we used a recently developed equine primary respiratory cell culture system to study EHV-5 pathogenesis at the respiratory tract. PCR primers and a probe were designed to target gene E11 of the EHV-5 genome. Sensitivity and repeatability were established, and specificity was verified by testing multiple isolates of EHV-5, as well as DNA from other equine herpesviruses. Four-week old fully differentiated (mature), newly seeded (immature) primary equine respiratory epithelial cell (ERECs), and equine dermal cell cultures were inoculated with EHV-5 and the cells and supernatants collected daily for 14days. Blood lymphocytes and nasal swabs were collected from horses experimentally infected with equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1). The qPCR assay detected EHV-5 at stable concentrations throughout 14days in inoculated mature EREC and equine dermal cell cultures (peaking at 202 and 5861 viral genomes per 10(6) cellular $\beta$ actin, respectively). EHV-5 copies detected in the immature EREC cultures increased over 14days and reached levels greater than 10,000 viral genomes per 10(6) cellular $\beta$ actin. Moreover, EHV-5 was detected in the lymphocytes of 76{\%} of horses and in the nasal swabs of 84{\%} of horses experimentally infected with EHV-1 pre-inoculation with EHV-1. Post-inoculation with EHV-1, EHV-5 was detected in lymphocytes of 52{\%} of horses while EHV-5 levels in nasal swabs were not significantly different from pre-inoculation levels. In conclusion, qPCR was a reliable technique to investigate viral load in in vivo and in vitro samples, and EHV-5 replication in equine epithelial cells may be influenced by cellular stages of differentiation.},

abstract = {Cytomegalovirus (CMV), is the most common cause among congenital infections and is the most seen etiology in long-term sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and neurological impairment. Congenital CMV infection (CCMV) was reported in 0.15-2.2{\%} of live-borne neonates in studies from different countries. A significant proportion of infected infants are asymptomatic after birth and might only be detected by routine screening methods during the new born period. The aim of this study was to screen the saliva of live-born neonates with areal-time PCR based method for the detection of CCMV in our hospital. Saliva samples collected in half an hour after birth by dry dacron swabs and were evaluated for CMV DNA (Rt-PCR, Abbott Molecular USA) from 1000 babies born in Ege University Faculty of Medicine Hospital Obstetrics Clinic between October 2015-October 2017. For the confirmation of CCMV, saliva positive newborns were evaluated with the same method for CMV DNA from their urine or blood within 21 days. All newborns were screened for sensorineural hearing tests. Subjects were 497 girls (49.7{\%}) and 503 boys (50.3{\%}), with a mean weight of 3116.8 g and mean of 37.61 birth week. CMV DNA was positive in the saliva of 16 newborns (1.6{\%}). Fourteen newborns were weakly positive for CMV DNA in their saliva and were not confirmed for CCMV infection. Congenital CMV was confirmed in only two (0.2{\%}) with the CMV DNA results in urine and/or blood samples. One of the two newborns with CCMV was symptomatic and had a neurosensorial hearing loss. The other one was asymptomatic. Saliva samples, taken immediately after birth with a noninvasive and easy method for the detection of CMV DNA is very important for diagnosis of CCMV. Positive samples should be confirmed with CMV DNA in urine or blood samples of these newborns. In this study, detection of positivity in saliva samples that were confirmed with other samples of our newborn population for CCMV was 0.2{\%}. The specific diagnosis for CCMV in newborns with a noninvasive and easy collecting sample is important to avoid sequelae and for public health concerns.},

The major high risk population for RSV infection are{\textless}6month infants and elders with age older than 65 years. At present, BALB/c mice were wildly used as animal model for RSV infection, however there has no report about the comparison of different week-ages BALB/c mice after RSV infection. A different week-ages BALB/c mice model was described in this study to compare their susceptibility after RSV infection. Young(10weeks),middle aged(30weeks)and aged(60weeks)mice were intranasally infected with 106 or 107plaque-forming units (PFU) RSV, then clinical symptom, weight, RSV titer in nose/lung, histology and immunohistochemistry was examined. And age-related susceptibility was analyzed. A high-titer virus(107PFU)infection showed significant weight loss at 6-11 day post infection while 106 PFU didn't lead to obvious weight change. In 10(7) PFU infected group, replication of virus in nose and lung was detected, the virus in lung located around pulmonary alveoli, and the hematoxylin eosin stain showed significant infiltration of inflammatory cells and pathological tissue damage. Mice trended to be more susceptible to RSV infection as the growth of age. Older mice experience more weight loss. Lung histology of older mice showed more serious bronchiolitis and increased number of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaced, and 60week-old mice tended to be the most significant. In this study, we have successfully established a different week-ages BALB/c mice model, which will serve as the basis for investigating antibody or vaccine and further infection mechanism research of RSV.},

abstract = {Respiratory infections continue to pose a significant threat to human health. It is important to accurately and rapidly detect respiratory viruses. To compensate for the limits of current respiratory virus detection methods, we developed a 24-plex analysis (common respiratory virus-mass spectrometry [CRV-MS]) that can simultaneously detect and identify 21 common respiratory viruses based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry system. To evaluate the efficacy of the CRV-MS method, we used 102 samples that were confirmed positive for these common respiratory viruses. All tests using the CRV-MS method were effective, with no cross-reactivity observed with other common respiratory viruses. To confirm the usefulness of the CRV-MS method, we screened 336 nasal and throat swabs that were collected from adults or children with suspected viral acute respiratory tract infections using the CRV-MS method and consensus PCR/reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) methods. Excluding four RNase P-negative samples, the CRV-MS and consensus PCR/RT-PCR methods detected respiratory viruses in 92.5{\%} (307/332) and 89.5{\%} (297/332) of the samples, respectively. The two methods yielded identical results for 306 (92.2{\%}) samples, including negative results for 25 samples (7.5{\%}) and positive results for 281 samples (84.6{\%}). Differences between the two methods may reflect their different sensitivities. The CRV-MS method proved to be sensitive and robust, and it can be used in large-scale epidemiological studies of common respiratory virus infections.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of avian H9N2 viruses throughout Asia, along with their demonstrated ability to infect mammals, puts them high on the list of influenza viruses with pandemic potential for humans. In this study, we investigated whether H9N2 viruses could infect farmed minks. METHODS: First, we conducted a serological survey for avian influenza virus antibodies on a random sample of the field-trial population of farmed minks. Then we inoculated farmed minks with A/Chicken/Hebei/4/2008 H9N2 viruses and observed the potential pathogenicity of H9N2 virus and virus shedding in infected minks. RESULTS: H9 influenza antibodies could be detected in most farmed minks with a higher seropositivity, which indicated that farmed minks had the high prevalence of exposure to H9 viruses. After infection, the minks displayed the slight clinical signs including lethargy and initial weight loss. The infected lungs showed the mild diffuse pneumonia with thickened alveolar walls and inflammatory cellular infiltration. Influenza virus detection showed that viruses were detected in the allantoic fluids inoculated supernatant of lung tissues at 3 and 7 days post-infection (dpi), and found in the nasal swabs of H9N2-infected minks at 3-11 dpi, suggesting that H9N2 viruses replicated in the respiratory organ, were then shed outwards. HI antibody test showed that antibody levels began to rise at 7 dpi. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provided the serological and experimental evidences that strongly suggested farmed minks under the natural state were susceptible to H9N2 viral infection and might be the H9N2 virus carriers. It is imperative to strengthen the H9N2 viral monitoring in farmed minks and pay urgent attention to prevent and control new influenza viruses pandemic prevalence.},

Th1 CD4(+ )T cells were found to be the major sub-set of T lymphocytes in the HPV positive laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma microenvironment. BACKGROUND: To examine the prognostic significance of human papillomavirus (HPV) status in relation to the ratio of CD4/CD8 in LSCC. METHODS: In this study, 46 LSCC biopsy samples were retrospectively assessed using immunohistochemistry for CD4(+ )and CD8(+ )tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). HPV status was determined by HPV in situ hybridization (ISH) and p16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry. Of the 46 samples, 21 were evaluated for the expression of IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The influence of HPV status on locoregional tumor control and T-cell sub-sets infiltrating tumor microenvironment were investigated. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (41.3{\%}) were classified as HPV positive, who had improved disease-free survival (28{\%} in reduction, hazard ratio =0.10; 95{\%} CI =0.011-0.938). A direct correlation between the HPV status and the ratio of CD4/CD8 or mean levels of CD8(+ )T cells was observed. Compared with the HPV-negative samples, HPV-positive samples had a higher ratio of IFN-$\gamma$/IL-4 (24.43 ± 29.89 vs 3.90 ± 4.03; p = 0.0375).},

Main HNSCC risk factors are tobacco, alcohol, and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) usually have different etiology, increasing incidence and often show an improved survival when compared to HPV-negative cases. The objective of the current study was to retrospectively examine the influence of HPV on the survival of OPSCC patients in a non-Western population setting. Materials and methods: We determined the presence of HPV DNA and/or RNA in 99 formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples of OPSCC patients treated between 2002 and 2015. Patients were compared based on laboratory, demographic, clinical, life style characteristics and survival. Results: HPV RNA was found in 29.3{\%} cases. However, groups based on HPV data (either RNA, DNA or retrospectively collected p16 staining) did not show significant differences. Overall, 5-year survival was 30{\%} with minimal influence of the HPV positivity. Conclusions: The HPV influence on survival of OPSCC patients is not identical between populations probably due to other factors overshadowing the HPV effect. This should be taken into account when treatment or policy decisions are made in each particular setting.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Influenza in humans is often accompanied by gastroenteritis-like symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain nausea, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. RESULTS: Mice infected with three subtypes of respiratory influenza A virus (IAV), particularly H5N1 and H7N2, developed intestinal injury. The avian H5N1 and H7N2 IAV were detected in the small intestine, whereas the human H1N1 was not detected. Section staining with the sialic acid (SA) receptor demonstrated that the small intestine mainly expressed SA $\alpha$2, 3 Gal instead of SA $\alpha$2, 6 Gal which preferentially binds to avian IAV. The number of goblet and sIgA cells in the small intestine increased, whereas CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells decreased in all infected mice except for CD8(+) T cells increased in H7N2 infected mice. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory IAV infection, particularly infected by avian IAV, can cause small intestine structural damage and modify the local immune response, thereby resulting in gastroenteritis-like symptoms.},

abstract = {Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in mice is a commonly used animal model for studying human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections. In our previous studies, a mouse model based on an oronasal MCMV infection was set up for mimicking a natural infection, and the spleen was hypothesized to regulate viremia and virus dissemination to distal organs such as submandibular glands. Here, the role of the spleen during an MCMV infection was investigated by the comparison of intact and splenectomized Balb/c mice. Both highly passaged MCMV Smith and low passaged MCMV HaNa1 were used. Various samples were collected at 7, 14, and 21 days post inoculation (dpi) for analyses by virus isolation/titration, co-cultivation and qPCR. The results showed that for both virus strains, 1) cell-associated virus in PBMC (determined by co-cultivation) was detected in intact mice but not in splenectomized mice; 2) the mean viral DNA load in PBMC of splenectomized mice was 4.4-(HaNa1)/2.7-(Smith) fold lower at the peak viremia (7dpi) in contrast to that of intact mice; and 3) infectious virus in the submandibular glands was detected later in splenectomized mice (14dpi) than in intact mice (7dpi). Moreover, the average virus titers in submandibular glands of splenectomized mice were 10-(HaNa1)/7.9-(Smith) fold lower at 14dpi and 1.7-(HaNa1)/2.1-(Smith) fold lower at 21dpi compared with that of intact mice. Upon inoculation with MCMV Smith, infectious virus was found in the kidneys and liver of intact mice, but not in splenectomized mice. Taken together, all these data clearly demonstrate that virus dissemination to distant organs is reduced in splenectomized mice, further confirming the importance of the spleen as a viremia booming site for a natural MCMV infection.},

abstract = {Nasal-type natural killer/T-cell (NK/T-cell) lymphomas are subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), which are typically more clinically aggressive. There is, however relatively little understanding of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma molecular pathogenesis. Thus, in this study we applied RNA sequencing to systematically screen for altered gene expression in human NK/T-cell lymphoma cell lines YTS and SNK-6 versus normal NK cells. We found that ATP-binding cassette sub-family C Member 4 (ABCC4) levels were significantly upregulated both in human NK/T-cell lymphoma YTS and SNK-6 cells, as compared with normal NK cells. These expression levels were further confirmed by real-time PCR. Protein levels of ABCC4 were also significantly higher in YTS and SNK-6 cells as compared with normal NK cells. Clinically relevant, ABCC4 expression levels were significantly higher in human NK/T-cell lymphoma tissues as compared with control nasal mucosa tissues, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we explored the biological function of such ABCC4 upregulation. Overexpression of ABCC4 by lentivirus transfection induced chemotherapy resistance to epirubicin (EPI) and cisplatin (DDP) in YTS cells. In contrast, knockdown of ABCC4 expression by shRNA contributed to chemotherapy sensitivity by both EPI and DDP. Furthermore, overexpression of ABCC4 inhibited, while downregulation of ABCC4 increased, YTS cell apoptosis following treatment by EPI or DDP. Therefore, the present study identified ABCC4 to be overexpressed in human NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, to regulate chemotherapy sensitivity to EPI and DDP, and possibly to be a functional therapeutic target. These findings may provide a basic rationale for new approaches in the effort to develop anti-tumor therapeutics for NK/T-cell lymphoma.},

abstract = {Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) causes respiratory disease, abortion and neurological disorders in horses. Besides epithelial cells, CD172a(+) monocytic cells become infected with EHV-1 in the respiratory mucosa and transport the virus from the apical side of the epithelium to the lamina propria en route to the lymph and blood circulation. Whether CD172a(+) monocytic cells are specifically recruited to the infection sites in order to pick up virus is unknown. In our study, equine nasal mucosa explants were inoculated with EHV-1 neurological strains 03P37 and 95P105 or the non-neurological strains 97P70 and 94P247 and the migration of monocytic cells was examined by immunofluorescence. Further, the role of monokines CCL2 and CCL5 was determined and the effect of migration inhibitors rosiglitazone (RSG) or quinacrine was analyzed. It was shown that with neurological strains but not with the non-neurological strains, CD172a(+) cells specifically migrated towards EHV-1 infected regions and that CCL2 and CCL5 were involved. CCL2 started to be expressed in infected epithelial cells at 24 h post-incubation (hpi) and CCL5 at 48 hpi, which corresponded with the CD172a(+) migration. RSG treatment of EHV-1-inoculated equine nasal mucosa had no effect on the virus replication in the epithelium, but decreased the migration of CD172a(+) cells in the lamina propria. Overall, these findings bring new insights in the early pathogenesis of EHV-1 infections, illustrate differences between neurological and non-neurological strains and show the way for EHV-1 treatment.},

abstract = {A growing number of molecular epidemiological studies have been conducted to evaluate the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the malignancy of sinonasal inverted papilloma (SNIP). However, the results remain inconclusive. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess this association. Case-control studies investigating SNIP tissues for presence of HPV DNA were identified. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the Mantel-Haenszel method. An assessment of publication bias and sensitivity analysis were also performed. We calculated a pooled OR of 2.16 (95{\%} CI=1.46-3.21, P{\textless}0.001) without statistically significant heterogeneity or publication bias. Stratification by HPV type showed a stronger association for patients with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types, HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-16/18 infection (OR=8.8 [95{\%} CI: 4.73-16.38], 8.04 [95{\%} CI: 3.34-19.39], 18.57 [95{\%} CI: 4.56-75.70], and 26.24 [4.35-158.47], respectively). When only using PCR studies, pooled ORs for patients with hrHPV, HPV-16, and HPV18 infection still reached statistical significance. However, Egger's test reflected significant publication bias in the HPV-16 sub-analysis (P=0.06), and the adjusted OR was no longer statistically significant (OR=1.65, 95{\%}CI: 0.58-4.63). These results suggest that HPV infection, especially hrHPV (HPV-18), is significantly associated with malignant SNIP.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic features, immunophenotype, differential diagnosis and prognosis of non-keratinizing carcinoma of nasal cavity and paranasal sinus. METHODS: Four hundred and forty-one cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal cavity and sinuses diagnosed in Beijing Tongren Hospital from January 2008 to August 2015 were included. Twenty-six cases of non-keratinizing carcinomas were selected. The histopathologic features and the clinicopathologic data of these twenty-six cases were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (two-step EnVision method) was done to evaluate the expression of CK, vimentin, CK5/6, CK7, CK8/18, p16, p53, Ki-67 etc. In situ hybridization was used to detect Epstein-Barr virus mRNA(EBER), and flow-through hybridization was used to evaluate the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV). One of the cases which HPV is positive was detected by HPV in situ hybridization and RNAscope technology. RESULTS: The mean age for the twenty-six patients (16 males, 10 females) was 51.2 years (range 22 to 79 years). Three patients had a history of inverted papilloma.Microscopically the tumors showed invasive papillary and inverted growth, and formed solid cell nests with different sizes. It was similar to papillary carcinoma of the urinary tract: the nuclei of the tumor were rounded and the nucleolus are clear. Three cases displayed transition between normal epithelium to neoplastic cells; in two cases (2/26), some tumor cells were spindle shaped. Twenty cases (20/20) were strongly positive for CK, p63; 17 cases (17/20) were strongly positive for CK5/6 and three cases (3/20) were focally positive. Sixteen cases were strongly positive for CK8/18 and three cases (3/20) were focally positive and one case was negative. Seven cases (7/20) were strongly positive for CK7 and 13 cases (13/20) were negative. Two cases (2/20) were focally positive for vimentin and eighteen (18/20) cases were negative. One case (1/20) was strongly positive for p16 and nineteen cases (19/20) were negative. Nineteen cases (19/20) were positive for p53 and one case (1/20) was negative. Ki-67 index was {\textgreater}50{\%} in 11 cases. Twenty cases (20/20) were negative for AFP, NUT, S-100 protein, HMB45 and Melan A. One case was positive for HPV (6, 11, 16, 18), as detected by in situ hybridization. The HPV18 mRNA was detected by RNAscope technique. In situ hybridization were negative in all twenty cases. The mean follow-up time of the patients in this group was less than 5 years, and the prognosis needs further observation. CONCLUSIONS: Non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma is a rare neoplasm with distinct morphological characteristics. Its diagnosis is primarily based on the site of lesions and the histological features.Immunohistochemistry staining can aid the diagnosis and differential diagnoses. The tumor may originate from the epithelium of nasal cavity and sinus. This disease has no relation with HPV and EBV infection, and the treatment is primarily surgical excision combined with postoperative radiotherapy.},

However, lack of a suitable animal model for EV-D68 infection has limited the study on the pathogenesis of this critical pathogen, and the development of a vaccine. Ferrets have been widely used to evaluate respiratory virus infections. In the current study, we used EV-D68-infected ferrets as a potential animal to identify impersonal indices, involving clinical features and histopathological changes in the upper and lower respiratory tract (URT and LRT). The research results demonstrate that the EV-D68 virus leads to minimal clinical symptoms in ferrets. According to the viral load detection in the feces, nasal, and respiratory tracts, the infection and shedding of EV-D68 in the ferret model was confirmed, and these results were supported by the EV-D68 VP1 immunofluorescence confocal imaging with $\alpha$2,6-linked sialic acid (SA) in lung tissues. Furthermore, we detected the inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression level, which implied high expression levels of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-8, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13, and IL-17a in the lungs. These data indicate that systemic observation of responses following infection with EV-D68 in ferrets could be used as a model for EV-D68 infection and pathogenesis.},

METHODS: The clinical data of 90 children with influenza A with positive influenza A virus nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swab detected by PCR were collected, and these children were divided into simple influenza A group (n=10), influenza A-pneumonia group (n=61), influenza A-nervous system damage group (n=10), and influenza A-underlying disease group (n=9). A retrospective analysis was performed for clinical features, treatment process, duration of viral nucleic acid shedding, and prognosis. RESULTS: The most common symptoms in these children were fever (89/90, 99{\%}), cough (89/90, 99{\%}), running nose (69/90, 77{\%}), shortness of breath (26/90, 29{\%}), and myalgia (23/90, 26{\%}). The mean duration of viral nucleic acid shedding in 90 children was 9.4±2.9 days. The simple influenza A group had a significantly shorter duration of viral nucleic acid shedding than the influenza A-pneumonia, influenza A-nervous system damage, and influenza A-underlying disease groups (p{\textless}0.05), while there were no significant differences between the influenza A-pneumonia, influenza A-nervous system damage, and influenza A-underlying disease groups (p{\textgreater}0.05). The children who received antiviral therapy within 48 hours after disease onset had significantly shorter duration of viral nucleic acid shedding and time to body temperature recovery than those who received antiviral therapy more than 48 hours after disease onset (p{\textless}0.05). Of all the children with body temperature recovery, 83{\%} still tested positive for viral nucleic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Complications, underlying diseases, and timing of antiviral therapy are influencing factors for the duration of influenza A virus nucleic acid shedding, and whether body temperature returns to normal cannot be used to decide whether to continue antiviral therapy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A birth cohort dedicated to studying infections in early childhood may be assisted by parental recording of symptoms on a daily basis and a collection of biomaterials. We aimed at testing the feasibility of this approach for use in a long-term study focusing on infections in children in Germany. METHODS: Parents of 1- to 3-year-old children (n = 75) were recruited in nursery schools. They were asked to complete a symptom diary on a daily basis and to take monthly and symptom-triggered nasal swabs and stool samples from their child over the study period of three months. Feasibility was measured by means of the return proportions of symptom diaries and bio samples; acceptance was assessed by a questionnaire delivered to participants at the end of the study. RESULTS: The majority of the participants filled in the symptom diary during the three months study for 75 or more days (77.3{\%}), and provided the monthly nasal swabs (62.7{\%}) and stool samples (65.3{\%}). The time needed for the tasks was acceptable for most participants (symptom diary: 92.3{\%}, nasal swabs: 98.5{\%}, stool samples: 100.0{\%}). In 64.3{\%} of the symptom-triggered nasal swabs, respiratory viruses were found compared to 55.5{\%} in throat swabs taken by health-care professionals within the "ARE surveillance Lower Saxony", a special project by the Governmental Institute of Public Health of Lower Saxony to investigate causal pathogens for acute respiratory infections in children. CONCLUSIONS: The parental assessment of symptoms and collection of biomaterials in a birth cohort dedicated to studying infections appears feasible in a middle class German population. The success of the study will depend on the ability to maintain these activities over a long time period.},

Through surveillance in Pakistan, nasal (n = 776) and serum (n = 1050) samples were collected from camels between November 2015 and February 2018. Samples were collected from animal markets, free-roaming herds and abattoirs. An in-house ELISA was developed to detect IgG against MERS-CoV. A total of 794 camels were found seropositive for MERS-CoV. Prevalence increased with the age and the highest seroprevalence was recorded in camels aged {\textgreater} 10 years (81.37{\%}) followed by those aged 3.1-10 years (78.65{\%}) and ≤ 3 years (58.19{\%}). Higher prevalence was observed in female (78.13{\%}) as compared to male (70.70{\%}). Of the camel nasal swabs, 22 were found to be positive by RT-qPCR though with high Ct values. Moreover, 2,409 human serum samples were also collected from four provinces of Pakistan during 2016-2017. Among the sampled population, 840 humans were camel herders. Although we found a high rate of MERS-CoV antibody positive dromedaries (75.62{\%}) in Pakistan, no neutralizing antibodies were detected in humans with and without contact to camels.},

abstract = {Rhino-and enteroviruses are important human pathogens, against which no antivirals are available. The best-studied inhibitors are “capsid binders” that fit in a hydrophobic pocket of the viral capsid. Employing a new class of entero-/rhinovirus inhibitors and by means of cryo–electron microscopy (EM), followed by resistance selection and reverse genetics, we discovered a hitherto unknown druggable pocket that is formed by viral proteins VP1 and VP3 and that is conserved across entero-/rhinovirus species. We propose that these inhibitors stabilize a key region of the virion, thereby preventing the conformational expansion needed for viral RNA release. A medicinal chemistry effort resulted in the identification of analogues targeting this pocket with broad-spectrum activity against Coxsackieviruses B (CVBs) and compounds with activity against enteroviruses (EV) of groups C and D, and even rhinoviruses (RV). Our findings provide novel insights in the biology of the entry of entero-/rhinoviruses and open new avenues for the design of broad-spectrum antivirals against these pathogens.},

abstract = {The current study is a retrospective epidemic report regarding dengue fever (DF) virus infection cases (2017) from fifteen districts of KPK, Pakistan. Medical records of 120 948 patients were reviewed retrospectively for demographic, clinical and laboratory data. The presence of dengue infection was confirmed by NS1-ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. The total positive cases (of suspected DF samples) were 24 938 (20.6{\%}), whereas seventy cases (0.28{\%}) had a fatal outcome. Mean age ± SD of the dengue patients was 26 ± 19.8 years, while; the most affected age group was from 16 to 30 years (Chi-square: 12 820.125, p: 0.00). The infected males were 65.3{\%}, and that of the female was 34.7{\%}. All the dengue-infected patients were observed with symptoms of severe fever (100{\%}), body aches (95{\%}), gums and nose bleeding (5{\%}), skin rashes (30{\%}), vomiting (70{\%}). The highest infection rate was found in district Peshawar and that of the lowest was in Bannu, Hungu and Luki Marwat. A high rate of dengue infection was found in post-monsoon months i.e. October (41{\%}) and September (32{\%}) of the year. The results proved that if the dengue outbreaks reveal further in KPK, it could alarmingly increase the mortality rate. Therefore, the Department of Public Health in KPK, Pakistan may take proper measures to avoid and control dengue epidemics in the future.},

abstract = {Background: The development of strategies to accelerate disease resolution and shorten antibiotic therapy is imperative in curbing the global tuberculosis epidemic. Therapeutic application of novel vaccines adjunct to antibiotics represents such a strategy. Methods: By using a murine model of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), we have investigated whether a single respiratory mucosal therapeutic delivery of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing Ag85A (AdCh68Ag85A) accelerates TB disease control in conjunction with antibiotics and restricts pulmonary disease rebound after premature (nonsterilizing) antibiotic cessation. Results: We find that immunotherapy via the respiratory mucosal, but not parenteral, route significantly accelerates pulmonary mycobacterial clearance, limits lung pathology, and restricts disease rebound after premature antibiotic cessation. We further show that vaccine-activated antigen-specific T cells, particularly CD8 T cells, in the lung play an important role in immunotherapeutic effects. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a single-dose respiratory mucosal immunotherapy with AdCh68Ag85A adjunct to antibiotic therapy has the potential to significantly accelerate disease control and shorten the duration of conventional treatment. Our study provides the proof of principle to support therapeutic applications of viral-vectored vaccines via the respiratory route.},

abstract = {Adenovirus infection is common in childhood and is generally associated with self-limited disease. Cidofovir, a viral DNA polymerase inhibitor, is used to treat adenovirus infection in select populations but is not often recommended for immunocompetent patients because of limited antiviral activity and nephrotoxicity. Here, we report a case of fulminant adenovirus infection associated with lymphopenia and multiple organ failure requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in a previously healthy child. After 1 week of supportive therapy, the patient had persistent organ failure and continued to have adenoviremia of {\textgreater}560 000 copies per mL. Weekly doses of cidofovir with concurrent probenecid for renal protection was initiated. Adenovirus blood load declined after the first cidofovir dose, becoming undetectable after 3 doses. The patient was successfully decannulated from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, extubated, and eventually discharged at his functional baseline without need for ongoing respiratory support. Lymphopenia improved after viremia resolved, and a subsequent immunologic workup revealed no evidence of primary immunodeficiency. The viral isolate was genotyped as adenovirus type 7. This case reveals the successful use of cidofovir for management of severe adenovirus infection in a previously healthy child. To date, there are no universally accepted recommendations for the use of cidofovir in this population. Further study is warranted to determine the potential role of cidofovir in treating severe adenovirus infections in immunocompetent children.},

abstract = { The influence of living in small remote villages on the diversity of viruses in the nasal mucosa was investigated in three Colombian villages with very different levels of geographic isolation. Metagenomic analysis was used to characterize viral nucleic acids in nasal swabs from 63 apparently healthy young children. Sequences from human virus members of the families Anelloviridae , Papillomaviridae , Picornaviridae , Herpesviridae , Polyomaviridae , Adenoviridae , and Paramyxoviridae were detected in decreasing proportions of children. The number of papillomavirus infections detected was greater among Hispanic children most exposed to outside contacts, while anellovirus infections were more common in the isolated indigenous villages. The diversity of the other human viruses detected did not differ among the villages. Closely related variants of rhinovirus A or B were identified in 2 to 4 children from each village, reflecting ongoing transmission clusters. Genomes of viruses not currently known to infect humans, including members of the families Parvoviridae , Partitiviridae , Dicistroviridae , and Iflaviridae and circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) virus, were also detected in nasal swabs, possibly reflecting environmental contamination from insect, fungal, or unknown sources. Despite the high levels of geographic and cultural isolation, the overall diversity of human viruses in the nasal passages of children was not reduced in highly isolated indigenous villages, indicating ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses.  IMPORTANCE Extreme geographic and cultural isolation can still be found in some indigenous South American villages. Such isolation may be expected to limit the introduction of otherwise common and widely distributed viruses. Very small population sizes may also result in rapid local viral extinction due to a lack of seronegative subjects to maintain transmission chains for rapidly cleared viruses. We compared the viruses in the nasal passages of young children in three villages with increasing levels of geographic isolation. We found that isolation did not reduce the overall diversity of viral infections. Multiple infections with nearly identical rhinoviruses could be detected within each village, likely reflecting recent viral introductions and transmission clusters among epidemiologically linked members of these very small communities. We conclude that, despite their geographic isolation, remote indigenous villages show evidence of ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses. },

Human papillomavirus 16 is a high-risk mucosal human papillomavirus type, usually associated with anogenital and oropharyngeal cancer. This paper describes the first two cases of human papillomavirus 16 and p16 related nasal cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.Method Prospective case series from December 2015.Results Two young, male, fair-skinned patients had large (greater than 20 mm), rapidly growing, ulcerated lesions of the nasal tip. The tumours were excised, with at least a 6 mm margin, and the patients' noses were subsequently reconstructed. Neither patient had cervical lymphadenopathy or underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. Both patients were registered at the same general practice. The tumours were human papillomavirus 16 and p16 positive; the latter indicated that the virus was driving the disease process. Except for superficial burns, neither patient had other risk factors.Conclusion Changes in sexual practices have led to an increase in human papillomavirus positive oropharyngeal carcinoma and there may be an associated increase in human papillomavirus type 16 positive nasal cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to compare the protection afforded by a standard face shield design with a new enhanced design in a controlled setting. METHODS: This study was exempted from review by institutional review board waiver. A flexible fiberoptic endoscopy was placed through stellate openings in the standard face shield and the enhanced face shield. A series of simulated coughs were created with bursts of fluorescein dye through an atomizer tip placed within the test participant's mouth. Ultraviolet lighting illuminated the test area, and areas of dye splatter were noted. RESULTS: Fluorescein dye is easily aerosolized along the lateral inferior aspect of a standard shield with significant contamination of the surrounds. The enhanced face shield maintained a barrier to the aerosolized dye. DISCUSSION: Face shields, rather than face masks, should be considered a preferred alternative for the public and for health care professionals alike, as they address many of the personal protective equipment concerns especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Otolaryngologists are at high risk from aerosol-generating procedures, such as flexible fiberoptic endoscopy, even when wearing personal protective equipment. Here we describe a uniquely designed face shield to be worn by the patient as another layer of protection for the environment and for medical personnel.

abstract = {Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA) is a contagious neoplasm of sheep and goats, associated with the oncogenic retroviruses enzootic nasal tumor virus (ENTV) 1 and 2, respectively. It appears to be common in countries with substantial small ruminant-production. ENA diagnosis in goats is based on autopsy and histopathology, and there is no real-time PCR method available for ENTV-2 detection. Here, a novel one-tube real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) method for the detection and quantification of ENTV-2 in nasal swabs is presented. The method targets the env gene/U3 region. For the design of ENTV-2-specific oligonucleotides, molecular characterization of seven Greek ENTV-2 strains was performed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three distinct phylogenetic clades of ENTV-2 that correlate with the country of sample collection. Evaluation of the analytical performance of the RT-qPCR revealed an amplification efficiency of 92.8{\%} and a linear range of quantification between 2 × 10 8 and 2 × 10 2 RNA transcripts. Analysis of nasal swabs from 23 histopathologically confirmed, naturally occurring ENA cases via RT-qPCR yielded positive results. Moreover, modification of the method for use in a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay enables detection of proviral DNA in tumor specimens. Both methods are highly specific and can be used for the confirmation of ENA-suspected cases. Future applications could include ante-mortem diagnosis, verification of the ENTV-2-free status in animal trade, disease surveillance, and control programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infects 90{\%}-95{\%} of all adults globally and causes {\~{}} 1{\%} of all cancers. Differing proportions of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), gastric carcinoma (GC), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are associated with EBV. We sought to systematically review the global epidemiological evidence for risk factors that (in addition to EBV) contribute to the development of the EBV-associated forms of these cancers, assess the quality of the evidence, and compare and contrast the cancers. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science were searched for studies of risk factors for EBV-associated BL, GC, HL and NPC without language or temporal restrictions. Studies were excluded if there was no cancer-free comparator group or where analyses of risk factors were inadequately documented. After screening and reference list searching, data were extracted into standardised spreadsheets and quality assessed. Due to heterogeneity, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: 9916 hits were retrieved. 271 papers were retained: two BL, 24 HL, one GC and 244 NPC. The majority of studies were from China, North America and Western Europe. Risk factors were categorised as dietary, environmental/non-dietary, human genetic, and infection and clinical. Anti-EBV antibody load was associated with EBV-associated GC and BL. Although the evidence could be inconsistent, HLA-A alleles, smoking, infectious mononucleosis and potentially other infections were risk factors for EBV-associated HL. Rancid dairy products; anti-EBV antibody and EBV DNA load; history of chronic ear, nose and/or throat conditions; herbal medicine use; family history; and human genetics were risk factors for NPC. Fresh fruit and vegetable and tea consumption may be protective against NPC. CONCLUSIONS: Many epidemiological studies of risk factors in addition to EBV for the EBV-associated forms of BL, GC, HL and NPC have been undertaken, but there is a dearth of evidence for GC and BL. Available evidence is of variable quality. The aetiology of EBV-associated cancers likely results from a complex intersection of genetic, clinical, environmental and dietary factors, which is difficult to assess with observational studies. Large, carefully designed, studies need to be strategically undertaken to harmonise and clarify the evidence. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42017059806.},

COVID-19 is predominantly considered as an unavoidable pandemic, and scientists are very curious about how to provide the best protection to the public before a vaccine can be made available. There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation. These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well. In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.},

abstract = {There was a substantial increase with infections of H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) in humans during Wave 5 (2016-2017). To investigate whether H7N9 had become more infectious/transmissible and pathogenic overall, we characterized the receptor binding and experimentally infected ferrets with highly pathogenic (HP)- and low pathogenic (LP)-H7N9 isolates selected from Wave 5, and compared their pathogenicity and transmissibility with a Wave 1 isolate from 2013. Studies show that A/Anhui/1/2013 (LP) and A/Chicken/Heyuan/16876/2016 (HP) were highly virulent in ferrets, A/Guangdong/Th008/2017 (HP) and A/Chicken/Huizhou/HZ-3/2017 (HP) had moderate virulence and A/Shenzhen/Th001/2016 (LP) was of low virulence in ferrets. Transmission was observed only in ferrets infected with A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Chicken/Heyuan/16876/2016, consistent with the idea that sicker ferrets had a higher probability to transmit virus to naive animals. Given the Varied virulence and transmissibility observed in circulating H7N9 viruses from Wave 5, we conclude that the current public health risk of H7N9 has not substantially increased compared to 2013 and the circulating viruses are quite diverse.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given that individuals may make health decisions based on mass media coverage, and given that such decisions have broad consequences in the case of highly contagious infectious disease, it is imperative that public health practitioners are aware of mass media coverage on emerging health threats such as COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to examine the content of news segments covering COVID-19 posted on-line. METHODS: Using the Google Videos function on a cleared browser, all videos identified from January and February, 2020 were archived by URL for analysis. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 401 remained, comprising the sample. Content categories derived from trusted sources were applied to assess the content of broadcast news segments pertaining to COVID-19 on Google Videos. RESULTS: The most common topic mentioned across all videos was death and the death rate (43.6{\%}) and many connoted anxieties surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak (37.4{\%}). Critically important information about the prevention of COVID-19 spread received little attention. For example, only 3.0{\%} of videos discussed coughing into or blowing one's nose into a tissue and throwing the tissue away, 6.2{\%} talked about wearing a facemask when caring for the ill, and 8.8{\%} covered disinfecting highly touched objects and surfaces. International videos more often presented captions and English subtitles (with and without narration) (7.8{\%} vs. 0.9{\%}, p = 0.018) and even more frequently discussed death and the death rate associated with COVID-19 (56.9{\%} vs. 41.7{\%}, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Coupled with the resultant increase in negative emotion, the majority of videos missed an opportunity to reframe messages to encourage and promote coping strategies and health sustaining behaviors. Future videos should avoid contributing to negative emotion.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has posed formidable challenges for clinical laboratories seeking reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation. The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous examination to which tests are normally subjected prior to FDA approval. Our laboratory currently uses two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. The two platforms demonstrate comparable performances; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 h and 45 min, respectively. In search for a platform with a shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID Now COVID-19 assay, which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 min. We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID Now. Regardless of method of collection and sample type, Abbott ID Now COVID-19 had negative results in a third of the samples that tested positive by Cepheid Xpert Xpress when using nasopharyngeal swabs in viral transport media and 45{\%} when using dry nasal swabs.},

abstract = {Topical intra-nasal sprays are amongst the most commonly prescribed therapeutic options for sinonasal diseases in humans. However, inconsistency and ambiguity in instructions show a lack of definitive knowledge on best spray use techniques. In this study, we have identified a new usage strategy for nasal sprays available over-the-counter, that registers an average 8-fold improvement in topical delivery of drugs at diseased sites, when compared to prevalent spray techniques. The protocol involves re-orienting the spray axis to harness inertial motion of particulates and has been developed using computational fluid dynamics simulations of respiratory airflow and droplet transport in medical imaging-based digital models. Simulated dose in representative models is validated through in vitro spray measurements in 3D-printed anatomic replicas using the gamma scintigraphy technique. This work breaks new ground in proposing an alternative user-friendly strategy that can significantly enhance topical delivery inside human nose. While these findings can eventually translate into personalized spray usage instructions and hence merit a change in nasal standard-of-care, this study also demonstrates how relatively simple engineering analysis tools can revolutionize everyday healthcare. Finally, with respiratory mucosa as the initial coronavirus infection site, our findings are relevant to intra-nasal vaccines that are in-development, to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {The porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an RNA virus inducing abortion in sows and respiratory disease in young pigs, is a leading infectious cause of economic losses in the swine industry. Modified live vaccines (MLVs) help in controlling the disease, but their efficacy is often compromised by the high genetic diversity of circulating viruses, leading to vaccine escape variants in the field. In this study, we hypothesized that a DNA prime with naked plasmids encoding PRRSV antigens containing conserved T-cell epitopes may improve the protection of MLV against a heterologous challenge. Plasmids were delivered with surface electroporation or needle-free jet injection and European strain-derived PRRSV antigens were targeted or not to the dendritic cell receptor XCR1. Compared to MLV-alone, the DNA-MLV prime- boost regimen slightly improved the IFN T-cell response, and substantially increased the antibody response against envelope motives and the nucleoprotein N. The XCR1-targeting of N significantly improved the anti-N specific antibody response. Despite this immuno-potentiation, the DNA-MLV regimen did not further decrease the serum viral load or the nasal viral shedding of the challenge strain over MLV-alone. Finally, the heterologous protection, achieved in absence of detectable effective neutralizing antibodies, was not correlated to the measured antibody or to the IFN T-cell response. Therefore, immune correlates of protection remain to be identified and represent an important gap of knowledge in PRRSV vaccinology. This study importantly shows that a naked DNA prime immuno-potentiates an MLV, more on the B than on the IFN T-cell response side, and has to be further improved to reach cross-protection.},

abstract = {HIV infection chronically affects the central nervous system (CNS). Olfactory mucosa is a unique site in the respiratory tract that is directly connected to the CNS; thus we wanted to evaluate olfactory mucosa as a surrogate of CNS sampling.Design:We conducted a preliminary study examining HIV populations and susceptible cells in the olfactory mucosa.Methods:Olfactory mucosa was sampled by minimally invasive brushing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses were performed as per routine clinical procedures. Olfactory marker protein, CD4, CD8, and trans-activator of transcription (TAT) expressions were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Plasma, CSF, and olfactory mucosa HIV-RNA were quantified using the Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan assay, whereas HIV proviral DNA was evaluated on peripheral blood mononuclear cell and olfactory mucosa. HIV-1 env deep sequencing was performed for phylogenetic analysis.Results:Among ART-naive participants, 88.2{\%} (15/17), and among ART-treated participants, 21.4{\%} (6/28) had detectable HIV-RNA in samples from their olfactory mucosa; CSF escape was more common in patients with olfactory mucosa escape (50 vs. 7.9{\%}; P=0.010). Olfactory mucosa samples contained few cells positive for CD4, CD8, or HIV-DNA, and no HIV TAT-positive cells, indicating that this approach efficiently samples virions in the olfactory mucosa, but not HIV-infected cells. Yet, using a deep sequencing approach to phylogenetically compare partial HIV env genes in five untreated participants, we identified distinct viral lineages in the OM.Conclusions:The results of this study suggest that nasal brushing is a well tolerated and useful technique for sampling the olfactory mucosa. HIV-RNA was detected in most na{\"{i}}ve and in some treated patients, warranting larger longitudinal studies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the optimal contact time and concentration for viricidal activity of oral preparation of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 ('corona virus') to mitigate the risk and transmission of the virus in the dental practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) USA-WA1/2020 strain, virus stock was tested against oral antiseptic solutions consisting of aqueous povidone-iodine (PVP-I) as the sole active ingredient. The PVP-I was tested at diluted concentrations of 0.5{\%}, 1{\%}, and 1.5{\%}. Test media without any virus was added to 2 tubes of the compounds to serve as toxicity and neutralization controls. Ethanol (70{\%}) was tested in parallel as a positive control, and water only as a negative control. The test solutions and virus were incubated at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C) for time periods of 15 and 30 seconds. The solution was then neutralized by a 1/10 dilution in minimum essential medium (MEM) 2{\%} fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 µg/mL gentamicin. Surviving virus from each sample was quantified by standard end-point dilution assay and the log reduction value (LRV) of each compound compared to the negative (water) control was calculated. RESULTS: PVP-I oral antiseptics at all tested concentrations of 0.5{\%}, 1{\%}, and 1.5{\%}, completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 within 15 seconds of contact. The 70{\%} ethanol control group was unable to completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 after 15 seconds of contact, but was able to inactivate the virus at 30 seconds of contact. CONCLUSIONS: PVP-I oral antiseptic preparations rapidly inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. The viricidal activity was present at the lowest concentration of 0.5 {\%} PVP-I and at the lowest contact time of 15 seconds. This important finding can justify the use of preprocedural oral rinsing with PVP-I (for patients and health care providers) may be useful as an adjunct to personal protective equipment, for dental and surgical specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that there is a loss of smell in many patients, including in infected but otherwise asymptomatic individuals. The underlying mechanisms for the olfactory symptoms are unclear. Using a mouse model, we determined whether cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons. These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients. We also show that expression of the entry proteins increases in animals of old age. This may explain, if true also in humans, why individuals of older age are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

abstract = {Background: The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is a multiplexed influenza RT-PCR and microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time, developed to subtype seasonal A viruses (H1N1pdm2009 and H3N2), distinguish B viruses as Yamagata or Victoria lineage, and is the only FDA cleared assay capable of positive identification of a wide variety of A subtypes as “non-seasonal” A viruses from human nasal specimens. Objective: To evaluate clinical performance of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay for detection of seasonal influenza viruses in nasal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens, and to evaluate performance for detection of non-seasonal influenza viruses using contrived samples. Study Design: For seasonal viruses, a multisite study of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay using prospectively and retrospectively collected nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs was performed using the FDA-cleared CDC Human Flu Dx Panel as the comparator assay. For non-seasonal viruses, testing was performed at a single site using contrived samples from 100 unique non-seasonal strains representing 41 subtypes. Results: Sensitivity (95{\%} CI) and specificity (95{\%} CI) for each target group, respectively, from results of 1689 clinical specimens were: seasonal H1N1pdm2009: 96.4{\%} (87.9–99.0), 99.3{\%} (98.8–99.6), seasonal H3N2: 91.8{\%} (87.7–94.7), 99.7{\%} (99.2–99.9), Influenza B Victoria: 100{\%} (94.0–100.0), 99.9{\%} (99.6–100.0), and Influenza B Yamagata: 95.6{\%} (89.2–98.3), 99.9{\%} (99.6–100.0). The sensitivity and specificity from contrived influenza A non-seasonal viruses was determined to be 99.0{\%} (94.6–99.8) and 100{\%} (96.7–100.0). Conclusion: The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay has robust sensitivity and specificity for detecting and identifying all target virus groups, including non-seasonal influenza A, with same day results.},

abstract = {The culture of differentiated human airway epithelial cells allows the study of pathogen-host interactions and innate immune responses in a physiologically relevant in vitro model. As the use of primary cell culture has gained popularity the availability of the reagents needed to generate these cultures has increased. In this study we assessed two different media, Promocell and PneumaCult, during the differentiation and maintenance of well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell cultures (WD-PNECs). We compared and contrasted the consequences of these media on WD-PNEC morphological and physiological characteristics and their responses to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. We found that cultures generated using PneumaCult resulted in greater total numbers of smaller, tightly packed, pseudostratified cells. However, cultures from both media resulted in similar proportions of ciliated and goblet cells. There were no differences in RSV growth kinetics, although more ciliated cells were infected in the PneumaCult cultures. There was also significantly more IL-29/IFN$\lambda$1 secreted from PneumaCult compared to Promocell cultures following infection. In conclusion, the type of medium used for the differentiation of primary human airway epithelial cells may impact experimental results.},

Horizontal transmission is well described, whereas evidence of vertical transmission of equid herpesvirus type 1 associated with the birth of a healthy foal has not been demonstrated. This study sampled a population of Thoroughbred mares (n = 71), and their healthy neonatal foals and foetal membranes, to test for the presence of both equid herpesvirus types 1 and 4 using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. Foetal membrane swabs and tissue samples were taken immediately post-partum, and venous blood samples and nasal swabs were obtained from both mare and foal 8 h after birth. Neither equid herpesvirus type 1 nor equid herpesvirus type 4 nucleic acid was detected in any sample, and it was concluded that there was no active shedding of equid herpesvirus types 1 and 4 at the time of sampling. Consequently, no evidence of vertical transmission of these viruses could be found on this stud farm during the sampling period.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is characterized by repeated formation of papillomas in the respiratory tract and is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. Women with genital HPV infection are slow to develop weak humoral immunity, but respond robustly to the HPV vaccine. We wondered if people with RRP had a similar immune response. METHODS: A convenience cross-sectional sample of patients with RRP were recruited into one of four groups: 1) adults and adolescents with active RRP, 2) children with active RRP, 3) RRP patients who had undergone HPV vaccination prior to enrollment and, 4) people with RRP who were in remission. Anti-HPV6 and HPV11 serology was determined by cLIA on a single blood draw. RESULTS: Of the 70 subjects enrolled, 36, 16, 8, and 10, were in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. 47{\%} of participants aged {\textgreater}11 years and 81{\%} aged ≤11 years possessed no antibodies against HPV6 or HPV11 (ie. double seronegative). 61{\%} of patients in remission were double seronegative. All participants who had received HPV vaccine previously were seropositive to at least one of these low risk HPV types (ie none of them were double seronegative). Among patients who had active RRP and never had HPV vaccination (n = 52) there was an association between duration of symptoms and seropositivity. Of those who were seropositive, the geometric mean duration of symptoms was 11 years compared to 4.7 years for those who were seronegative (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: People with RRP are capable of developing a humoral response to HPV6 and HPV11. That response appears to be robust when initiated by the HPV vaccine, but either nonexistent or slow to develop in response to infection. Most in remission do not have demonstrable antibody levels against HPV6 or HPV11.},

abstract = {The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has very high infectivity, which allows it to spread rapidly around the world. Attempts at slowing the pandemic at this stage depend on the number and quality of diagnostic tests performed. We propose that the olfactory epithelium from the nasal cavity may be a more appropriate tissue for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the earliest stages, prior to onset of symptoms or even in asymptomatic people, as compared to commonly used sputum or nasopharyngeal swabs. Here we emphasize that the nasal cavity olfactory epithelium is the likely site of enhanced binding of SARS-CoV-2. Multiple non-neuronal cell types present in the olfactory epithelium express two host receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteases, that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 binding, replication, and accumulation. This may be the underlying mechanism for the recently reported cases of smell dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, the possibility of subsequent brain infection should be considered which begins in olfactory neurons. In addition, we discuss the possibility that olfactory receptor neurons may initiate rapid immune responses at early stages of the disease. We emphasize the need to undertake research focused on additional aspects of SARS-CoV-2 actions in the nervous system, especially in the olfactory pathway.},

abstract = {Norovirus accounts for a large portion of the gastroenteritis disease burden, and outbreaks have occurred in a wide variety of environments. Understanding the role of fomites in norovirus transmission will inform behavioral interventions, such as hand washing and surface disinfection. The purpose of this study was to estimate the contribution of fomite-mediated exposures to infection and illness risks in outbreaks. A simulation model in discrete time that accounted for hand-to-porous surfaces, hand-to-nonporous surfaces, hand-to-mouth, -eyes, -nose, and hand washing events was used to predict 17 hr of simulated human behavior. Norovirus concentrations originated from monitoring contamination levels on surfaces during an outbreak on houseboats. To predict infection risk, two dose-response models (fractional Poisson and 2 F 1 hypergeometric) were used to capture a range of infection risks. A triangular distribution describing the conditional probability of illness given an infection was multiplied by modeled infection risks to estimate illness risks. Infection risks ranged from 70.22{\%} to 72.20{\%} and illness risks ranged from 21.29{\%} to 70.36{\%}. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the number of hand-to-mouth contacts and the number of hand washing events had strong relationships with model-predicted doses. Predicted illness risks overlapped with leisure setting and environmental attack rates reported in the literature. In the outbreak associated with the viral concentrations used in this study, attack rates ranged from 50{\%} to 86{\%}. This model suggests that fomites may have accounted for 25{\%} to 82{\%} of illnesses in this outbreak. Fomite-mediated exposures may contribute to a large portion of total attack rates in outbreaks involving multiple transmission modes. The findings of this study reinforce the importance of frequent fomite cleaning and hand washing, especially when ill persons are present.},

abstract = {Background: An emerging subset of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) is caused by HPV. HPV-positive OPSCC has a better prognosis than HPV-negative OPSCC, but other prognostic markers for these two different diseases are scarce. Our aim was to evaluate serum levels and tumor expression of matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and to assess their prognostic role in HPV-positive and HPV-negative OPSCC. Materials and methods: A total of 90 consecutive OPSCC patients diagnosed and treated with curative intent at the Helsinki University Hospital between 2012 and 2016 were included. Serum samples were prospectively collected. An immunofluorometric assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to determine MMP-8 and TIMP-1 serum concentrations, respectively. HPV status of the tumors was determined using a combination of HPV-DNA genotyping and p16-INK4a immunohistochemistry. The endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: High TIMP-1 serum levels were strongly and independently associated with poorer OS (adjusted HR 14.7, 95{\%} CI 1.8–117.4, p = 0.011) and DFS (adjusted HR 8.7, 95{\%} CI 1.3–57.1, p = 0.024) among HPV-negative patients; this association was not observed in HPV-positive OPSCC. Although TIMP-1 was immunoexpressed in the majority of the tumor tissue samples, the level of immunoexpression was not associated with prognosis, nor did MMP-8 serum levels. Conclusion: Our results indicate that serum TIMP-1 levels may serve as an independent prognostic marker for HPV-negative OPSCC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The etiological role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is confirmed. However, the role of other oncoviruses in OPSCC is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 158 consecutive OPSCC patients treated with curative intent were included. DNA extracted from tumor sections was used to detect Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HPV, and the following polyomaviruses: John Cunningham virus (JCV), Simian virus 40 (SV40), and BK virus (BKV) with PCR. In addition, p16 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry, and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) transcripts were localized by in situ hybridization. The effect of viral status on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 94/158 samples (59.5{\%}) were HPV-positive, 29.1{\%} contained BKV DNA, 20.3{\%} EBV DNA, 13.9{\%} JCV DNA, and 0.6{\%} SV40 DNA. EBER was expressed only in stromal lymphocytes adjacent to the tumor and correlated with HPV positivity (p = 0.026). p16 expression associated only with HPV. None of the three polyomaviruses had an impact on survival. Patients with EBER-positive but HPV-negative OPSCC had significantly poorer OS and DFS than those with HPV-positive OPSCC and slightly worse prognosis compared with the patients with EBER-negative and HPV-negative OPSCC. CONCLUSION: Polyomaviruses are detectable in OPSCC but seem to have no impact on survival, whereas HPV was the strongest viral prognostic factor. EBER expression, as a sign of latent EBV infection, may have prognostic impact among patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. EBER analysis may identify a new subgroup of OPSCCs unrelated to HPV.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV)–related carcinoma with adenoid cystic–like features is a rare, recently recognized entity restricted to the sinonasal tract. By definition, it is associated with high-risk HPV infection, particularly with HPV type 33. In most cases, tumors are composed of dual cell populations, including predominant basaloid myoepithelial cells and usually inconspicuous ductal cells. Solid components with focal cribriform or tubular patterns, abrupt keratinization within tumor nests, and squamous dysplasia of the surface epithelium are characteristics of HPV-related carcinoma with adenoid cystic–like features. The immunohistochemistry of p16 followed by high-risk HPV testing may help in the differential diagnosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the morphologic features of this entity are more diverse than initially believed. Surgical resection is the prime alternative for treatment. According to the limited data, the prognosis of this disease may be better than that of other sinonasal carcinomas.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the ocular characteristics and the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimens in a patient with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). PARTICIPANT AND METHODS: A 30-year-old man with confirmed COVID-19 and bilateral acute conjunctivitis which occurred 13 days after illness onset. Based on detailed ophthalmic examination, reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus in conjunctival swabs. The ocular characteristics, presence of viral RNA and viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival specimens were evaluated. RESULTS: Slit lamp examination showed bilateral acute follicular conjunctivitis. RT-PCR assay demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in conjunctival specimen 13 days after onset (cycle threshold value: 31). The conjunctival swab specimens remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 14 and 17 days after onset. On day 19, RT-PCR result was negative for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is capable of causing ocular complications such as viral conjunctivitis in the middle phase of illness. Precautionary measures are recommended when examining infected patients throughout the clinical course of the infection. However, conjunctival sampling might not be useful for early diagnosis because the virus may not appear initially in the conjunctiva.},

Coronavirus had not yet been successfully cultured from tears or conjunctival swabs in humans, neither SARS-CoV-2 nor SARS-CoV.

abstract = {Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) is one of the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in young children and has become prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. However, no approved vaccines or drugs are available for CV-A16 infection. CV-A16 virus-like particles (VLPs) are a potential vaccine candidate; however, whether the intranasal route of immunization is suitable for inducing immune responses against CV-A16 infection has not been clarified. In this study, the comprehensive immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the CV-A16 VLP vaccine were evaluated by multiple methods in a mouse model. In mice, a high neutralizing antibody (NTAb) titre could be elicited by intranasal immunization with CV-A16 VLPs, which produced NTAb levels similar to those induced by intranasal immunization with inactivated CV-A16. Passive immunity with NTAbs provided very good protection, as the survival rate of the immunized neonatal mice was 100{\%} after challenges with CV-A16 at a dose of 1000 LD50. Passive protective effects were transferred to the neonates via the mother, thus protecting all the pups against challenges with the homologous or heterologous strains of CV-A16 at a dose of 1000 LD50. In addition, intranasal immunization with CV-A16 VLPs also induced the production of mucosal secretory IgA (s-IgA) antibodies, which may inhibit CV-A16 virus invasion. This study provides valuable supplemental information to facilitate our understanding of the specific protective efficacy of CV-A16 VLPs and has significance for development of the candidate vaccine into a safe and effective vaccine.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: There is insufficient evidence on the efficacy of masks in the general population for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in public areas. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate the association of mandatory mask-wearing policies with behaviors associated with the transmission of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of mask wearing with face-touching behavior among the general population in public areas. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used videos recorded in public transportation stations, streets, and parks among the general population in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe (ie, England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy), and the US to analyze mask-wearing and face-touching behavior in public areas. Videos before the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded from January 2018 to October 2019, and those during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as those recorded during February 2020 to March 2020 in China, Japan, and South Korea and during March 2020 in Western Europe and the US. Individuals who clearly displayed their face and face-touching behavior were included, and those whose behaviors were influenced by filming or public events were excluded. EXPOSURES: Mandatory mask-wearing policies enacted at various time points in China, Japan, South Korea, Western Europe, and the US. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Proportion of individuals wearing masks and incidence of face touching. RESULTS: This study included 4699 individuals before the COVID-19 pandemic and 2887 individuals during the pandemic. During the periods studied, mask wearing increased in all regions except the US, from 20 of 1745 individuals (1.1{\%}) to 1090 of 1097 individuals (99.4{\%}) in mainland China (P {\textless} .001), 44 of 1422 individuals (3.1{\%}) to 346 of 893 individuals (38.7{\%}) in Japan (P {\textless} .001), 6 of 717 individuals (0.8{\%}) to 277 of 324 individuals (85.5{\%} ) in South Korea (P {\textless} .001), 1 of 546 individuals (0.2{\%}) to 6 of 379 individuals (1.6{\%}) in Western Europe (P = .02), and 1 of 269 individuals (0.4{\%}) to 4 of 194 individuals (2.1{\%}) in the US (P = .17). Surgical masks were predominant in China (989 masks [89.1{\%}]), and fabric masks were predominant in the other regions (Japan: 371 masks [95.1{\%}]; South Korea: 240 masks [84.8{\%}]; Western Europe: 6 masks [85.7{\%}]; US: 5 masks [100{\%}]). Face-touching behaviors decreased from before COVID-19 to during COVID-19 among individuals in China (72 incidences of 1745 observations [4.1{\%}] to 12 incidences of 1097 observations [1.1{\%}]; P {\textless} .001), South Korea (80 incidences of 717 observations [11.2{\%}] to 7 incidences of 324 observations [2.2{\%}]; P {\textless} .001), and Europe (62 incidences of 546 observations [11.4{\%}] to 23 incidences of 379 observations [6.1{\%}]; P = .01). Logistic regression found that mask wearing was associated with a reduction in face touching in China (odds ratio [OR], 3.91; 95{\%} CI, 2.11-7.24) and South Korea (OR, 6.69; 95{\%} CI, 2.69-16.69) and of touching the nose, mouth, and eyes (China: OR, 8.60; 95{\%} CI, 2.65-27.86; South Korea: OR, 29.27; 95{\%} CI, 1.79-478.22). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that mandatory mask-wearing policies were associated with increased mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mask wearing was associated with reduced face-touching behavior, especially touching of the eyes, nose, and mouth, which may prevent contact transmission of COVID-19 among the general population in public areas.},

abstract = {Background: Cell-surface mucins are expressed in apical epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, and contribute a crucial part of the innate immune system. Despite anti-inflammatory or antiviral functions being revealed for certain cell-surface mucins such as MUC1, the roles of other mucins are still poorly understood, especially in viral infections. Methods: To further identify mucins significant in influenza infection, we screened the expression of mucins in human nasal epithelial cells infected by H3N2 influenza A virus. Results: We found that the expression of MUC15 was significantly upregulated upon infection, and specific only to active infection. While MUC15 did not interact with virus particles or reduce viral replication directly, positive correlations were observed between MUC15 and inflammatory factors in response to viral infection. Given that the upregulation of MUC15 was only triggered late into infection when immune factors (including cytokines, chemokines, EGFR and phosphorylated ERK) started to peak and plateau, MUC15 may potentially serve an immunomodulatory function later during influenza viral infection. Conclusions: Our study revealed that MUC15 was one of the few cell-surface mucins induced during influenza infection. While MUC15 did not interact directly with influenza virus, we showed that its increase coincides with the peak of immune activation and thus MUC15 may serve an immunomodulatory role during influenza infection.},

abstract = {The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic originated in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare an official global COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In Hong Kong, clinicians and other healthcare personnel collaborated closely to combat the outbreak of COVID-19 and minimize the cross-transmission of disease among hospital staff members. In the field of otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) and its various subspecialties, contingency plans were required for patient bookings in outpatient clinics, surgeries in operating rooms, protocols in wards and other services. Infected patients may shed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) particles into their environments via body secretions. Therefore, otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel in this specialty face a high risk of contracting COVID-19 and must remain vigilant when performing examinations and procedures involving the nose and throat. In this article, we share our experiences of the planning and logistics undertaken to provide safe and efficient OHNS practices over the last 2 months, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that our experiences will serve as pearls for otolaryngologists and other healthcare personnel working in institutes that serve large numbers of patients every day, particularly with regard to the sharing of clinical and administrative tasks during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Background: Experimental data show that type I interferon has a key role in innate immune response against influenza infection. Objective: We compared nasal levels of interferon-$\alpha$2 and $\beta$ among inpatients and outpatients with influenza. Study design: Children younger than 5 years of age with influenza-like illness seeking care at the emergency department within the first 72 h of disease onset were prospectively included. Clinical and demographic data and secretions through nasal wash were obtained. Influenza infection was assessed through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and nasal levels of interferon-$\alpha$2 and $\beta$ were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All patients followed until the end of the disease. Results: One hundred patients were included, of which 24 had confirmed influenza infection, and 5 of them were hospitalized. Subtypes A (H3N2) and B were confirmed in 10 and 14 patients, respectively. Seventy-six patients without influenza, including 48{\%} of outpatients, were recruited as controls. All hospitalized patients were significantly younger regardless of influenza status (age {\textless}6 months in 59{\%} vs. 23.2{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). All other data were similar among the groups. Comparing median levels of interferon-$\alpha$2 among children with influenza, levels were significantly higher in outpatients than in hospitalized patients and were 263.2 pg/mL (25–75 interquartile range: 58.3–634) and detectable in only one patient (90 pg/mL), respectively. The levels of interferon-$\alpha$2 in controls and those of interferon-$\beta$ in all groups were not detected. Conclusions: Higher levels of interferon-$\alpha$2 in patients- with less severe influenza reinforce experimental evidence about the protective role of interferon-$\alpha$2 against influenza infection.},

abstract = {Coronavirus-19 (COVI-19) involves humans as well as animals and may cause serious damage to the respiratory tract, including the lung: coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This pathogenic virus has been identified in swabs performed on the throat and nose of patients who suffer from or are suspected of the disease. When COVI-19 infect the upper and lower respiratory tract it can cause mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$ and IL-6. The binding of COVI-19 to the Toll Like Receptor (TLR) causes the release of pro-IL-1$\beta$ which is cleaved by caspase-1, followed by inflammasome activation and production of active mature IL-1$\beta$ which is a mediator of lung inflammation, fever and fibrosis. Suppression of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members and IL-6 have been shown to have a therapeutic effect in many inflammatory diseases, including viral infections. Cytokine IL-37 has the ability to suppress innate and acquired immune response and also has the capacity to inhibit inflammation by acting on IL-18R$\alpha$ receptor. IL-37 performs its immunosuppressive activity by acting on mTOR and increasing the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase. This cytokine inhibits class II histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and inflammation in inflammatory diseases by suppressing MyD88 and subsequently IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, TNF and CCL2. The suppression of IL-1$\beta$ by IL-37 in inflammatory state induced by coronavirus-19 can have a new therapeutic effect previously unknown. Another inhibitory cytokine is IL-38, the newest cytokine of the IL-1 family members, produced by several immune cells including B cells and macrophages. IL-38 is also a suppressor cytokine which inhibits IL-1$\beta$ and other pro-inflammatory IL-family members. IL-38 is a potential therapeutic cytokine which inhibits inflammation in viral infections including that caused by coronavirus-19, providing a new relevant strategy.},

Using an in vivo model, here we report that murine astrovirus preferentially infects actively secreting small intestinal goblet cells, specialized epithelial cells that maintain the mucus barrier. Consequently, virus infection alters mucus production, leading to an increase in mucus-associated bacteria and resistance to enteropathogenic E. coli colonization. These studies establish the main target cell type and region of the gut for productive murine astrovirus infection. They further define a mechanism by which an enteric virus can regulate the mucus barrier, induce functional changes to commensal microbial communities, and alter host susceptibility to pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant worldwide disruption. Although Australia and New Zealand have not been affected as much as some other countries, resuscitation may still pose a risk to health care workers and necessitates a change to our traditional approach. This consensus statement for adult cardiac arrest in the setting of COVID-19 has been produced by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and aligns with national and international recommendations. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: In a setting of low community transmission, most cardiac arrests are not due to COVID-19. Early defibrillation saves lives and is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. Compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation is thought to be a low risk procedure and can be safely initiated with the patient's mouth and nose covered. All other resuscitative procedures are considered aerosol generating and require the use of airborne personal protective equipment (PPE). It is important to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection. Methods to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 include a physical barrier such as a towel or mask over the patient's mouth and nose, appropriate use of PPE, minimising the staff involved in resuscitation, and use of mechanical chest compression devices when available. If COVID-19 significantly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT: The changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all health care workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations. This will ensure safe, timely and effective management of the patients with cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era.},

abstract = {Objective. To describe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patient presentations requiring otolaryngology consultation and provide recommendations for protective measures based on the experience of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) departments in 4 Chinese hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design. Retrospective case series. Setting. Multicenter. Subjects and Methods. Twenty hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring ENT consultation from 3 designated COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen were identified. Data on demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and severity, consult reason, treatment, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected and analyzed. Infection control strategies implemented for ENT outpatients and emergency room visits at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University were reported. Results. Median age was 63 years, 55{\%} were male, and 95{\%} were in severe or critical condition. Six tracheotomies were performed. Posttracheotomy outcomes were mixed (2 deaths, 2 patients comatose, all living patients still hospitalized). Other consults included epistaxis, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, hyposmia, rhinitis, otitis externa, dizziness, and tinnitus. At all hospitals, powered air-supply filter respirators (PAPRs) were used for tracheotomy or bleeding control. PAPR or N95-equivalent masks plus full protective clothing were used for other complaints. No inpatient ENT providers were infected. After implementation of infection control strategies for outpatient clinics, emergency visits, and surgeries, no providers were infected at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University. Conclusions and Relevance. COVID-19 patients require ENT consultation for many reasons, including tracheotomy. Otolaryngologists play an indispensable role in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but, due to their work, are at high risk of exposure. Appropriate protective strategies can prevent infection of otolaryngologists.},

This study aimed to evaluate the presence of herpesvirus DNA in the upper respiratory tract of horses. Twenty-six nasal swabs were collected from asymptomatic adult horses of two different horse farms (A, n = 18; B, n = 8), both located in Southern Brazil. The EHV-1, EHV-2, EHV-4, and EHV-5 DNA analyses were performed using nested PCR assays targeting the glycoprotein B gene. Four (15.3{\%}) and 12 (46.1{\%}) of the 26 nasal swab samples were positive for the EHV-2 and EHV-5, respectively. Four (15.3{\%}) horses were detected with both viruses simultaneously. DNA of EHV-2 and EHV-5 in both single and mixed infections was identified in horses from both herds. All swab samples were negative for EHV-1 and EHV-4. This study reports the first detection of EHV-2 and EHV-5 in the upper respiratory tracts of horses in Brazil. The high detection rate of EHV-2 and EHV-5 in asymptomatic adult horses demonstrates that these gammaherpesviruses are circulating in Brazil.},

abstract = {The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was identified after a recent outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has kept the whole world in tenterhooks due to its severe life-threatening nature of the infection. The virus is unlike its previous counterparts, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, or anything the world has encountered before both in terms of virulence and severity of the infection. If scientific reports relevant to the SARS-CoV-2 virus are noted, it can be seen that the virus owes much of its killer properties to its unique structure that has a stronger binding affinity with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) protein, which the viruses utilize as an entry point to gain accesses to its hosts. Recent reports suggest that it is not just the lung that the virus may be targeting; the human brain may soon emerge as the new abode of the virus. Already instances of patients with COVID-19 have been reported with mild (anosmia and ageusia) to severe (encephalopathy) neurological manifestations, and if that is so, then it gives us more reasons to be frightened of this killer virus. Keeping in mind that the situation does not worsen from here, immediate awareness and more thorough research regarding the neuroinvasive nature of the virus is the immediate need of the hour. Scientists globally also need to up their game to design more specific therapeutic strategies with the available information to counteract the pandemic. In this Viewpoint, we provide a brief outline of the currently known neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss some probable ways to design therapeutic strategies to overcome the present global crisis.},

Animals used to be purchased from different origins, and no specific tests for disease monitoring or quarantine procedure were performed. Affected animals presented respiratory distress, anorexia with severe weight loss, and mucopurulent unilateral nasal discharge. Necropsy was performed in both animals and nasal cavity masses were observed. Histopathological analysis demonstrated an epithelial neoplasm compatible with nasal adenocarcinoma. PCR using a protocol that amplifies a 591 bp sequence of 5'LTR-gag region of ENTV1 was performed followed by DNA sequencing. Both samples were positive, and the sequences obtained presented highest identity (97{\%}) with ENTV strain TN28 (GenBank accession number MH899613) detected in a Texel sheep from Scotland. This is the first report of ENTV-1 leading to enzootic nasal tumor in sheep in Latin America, which confirms the presence of the retrovirus in sheep flocks in the Brazilian territory.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, over 80,000 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been confirmed in China. With the increasing number of recovered patients, more attention should be paid to the follow-up of these patients. METHODS: In the study, 576 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital in Chongqing, China from January 24, 2020, to March 10, 2020 were evaluated by viral nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) to determine if they could be released from quarantine. Among the 576 patients, 61 patients (10.6{\%}) had positive RT-PCR test results of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyze the demographics, clinical characteristics and treatment of 61 patients. RESULTS: These positive patients were characterized by older age, chronic medical illness and mild conditions. 38 (62.3{\%}) patients who were asymptomatic without abnormalities on chest radiographs were found in the positive with COVID-19. Also, they showed positive results of stool or sputum specimens with negative results of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The median duration of positive result of SARS-CoV-2 was varied from 3 days to 35 days in the patients discharged from hospital with no family member infection. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-site screening of SARS-CoV-2 including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, stool and sputum specimens could be considered to improve the diagnosis, treatment and infection control in patients with COVID-19. Our findings provide the important information and clinical evidence for the improved management of patients recovered from COVID-19.},

abstract = {Purpose: Approximately 20{\%} of cancers are estimated to have a viral etiology. We aimed to investigate whether DNA of 8 human parvoviruses [bocavirus 1–4 (HBoV1–4), parvovirus B19 (B19V), protoparvoviruses (bufa-, tusa-, and cutavirus)] and 13 human polyomaviruses (HPyV) can be detected in oropharyngeal and oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC/OSCC), and in juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) tissue samples. Methods: Fresh samples of seven JNA tissues and ten paired tissues of OSCC/OPSCC tumor and adjacent healthy tissues were collected. DNA extraction and real-time PCRs were performed to detect HBoV1-4, B19V, bufa- tusa- and cutavirus, and HPyV genomes. Results: JNA specimens were negative for all parvoviruses tested, whereas one JNA sample was Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) DNA positive. The OSCC/OPSCC samples were negative for the human protoparvoviruses, HBoV1-4, and all human polyomaviruses, except for one patient that was MCPyV DNA positive in both healthy and tumor tissues. Seven OSCC/OPSCC patients were positive for B19V DNA, three of them in both healthy and cancerous tissues and three in only healthy tissues. Three of the B19V DNA-positive patients harbored viral genotype 1, three genotype 2, and one genotype 3B. Conclusions: These are the first reports of MCPyV and B19V DNA being detected in JNA and OPSCC. The significance of viral DNA positivity is unclear. B19V DNA is known to remain in the tissues lifelong, however, it is of interest that there are some patients with B19 DNA in healthy tissue, but not in the corresponding cancer tissue.},

A 94-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease presented with necrotic nasal cellulitis and a red left eye with blurry vision. Onset was 2 weeks prior with an upper lip fever blister. He was admitted to medicine and started on antimicrobials. Maxillofacial computed tomography scan revealed pansinusitis with involvement of bilateral medial orbital walls. Initial nasal biopsy was negative. Repeat biopsy was positive for herpes simplex virus 1. His nose was debrided with full-thickness skin grafting. While there are reports of necrotizing herpes simplex, none were to the extent of our patient nor raised suspicion for invasive fungal sinusitis.

abstract = {Background: Sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) is a benign tumor with a high risk of local recurrence and a potential to malignify and Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been suggested an etiological factor. p16INK4a (p16) overexpression is considered a surrogate marker for HPV, but whether p16 and HPV correlate to IP is uncertain. Besides, a prognostic role of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are observed in many tumors, however their role in IP is sparsely studied. Aims/objectives: We hence analyzed IPs for the presence and the prognostic role of HPV and p16 overexpression together with CD8+ and FoxP3+ TILs in a population-based study. Material and methods: 98 IP patients diagnosed 2001–2010 were identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry and analyzed for HPV by PCR and p16, CD8 and FoxP3 was by immunohistochemistry. Results: In total, 12.2{\%} of the IPs were HPV-positive (nine HPV-11, two HPV-6 and one HPV-45). Patients with HPV-positive lesions were younger (p =.003) and tended to present with more dysplasia. No correlation was observed between TILs and prognosis. Conclusions and significance: Our data suggests that patients with HPV-positive IPs present with different clinical characteristics, suggesting possibly different disease entities. Moreover, recurrences may occur '5 years, which should be considered in the follow-up.},

abstract = {Influenza viruses cause respiratory infection, spread through respiratory secretions, and are shed into the nasal secretion and saliva specimens. Therefore, nasal fluid and saliva are effective clinical samples for the diagnosis of influenza virus-infected patients. Although several methods have been developed to detect various types of influenza viruses, approaches for detecting mutant influenza viruses in clinical samples are rarely reported. Herein, we report for the first time a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based sensing platform for oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus detection in human nasal fluid and saliva. By combining SERS-active urchin Au nanoparticles and oseltamivir hexylthiol, an excellent receptor for the pH1N1/H275Y mutant virus, we detected the pH1N1/H275Y virus specifically and sensitively in human saliva and nasal fluid samples. Considering that the current influenza virus infection testing methods do not provide information on the antiviral drug resistance of the virus, the proposed SERS-based diagnostic test for the oseltamivir-resistant virus will inform clinical decisions about the treatment of influenza virus infections, avoiding the unnecessary prescription of ineffective drugs and greatly improving therapy.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of intranasal immunization with CTA1-DD as mucosal adjuvant combined with H3N2 split vaccine. Methods: Mice were immunized intranasally with PBS (negative control), or H3N2 split vaccine (3 $\mu$g/mouse) alone, or CTA1-DD (5 $\mu$g/mouse) alone, or H3N2 split vaccine (3 $\mu$g/mouse) plus CTA1-DD (5 $\mu$g/mouse). Positive control mice were immunized intramuscularly with H3N2 split vaccine (3 $\mu$g/mouse) and alum adjuvant. All the mice were immunized twice, two weeks apart. Then sera and mucosal lavages were collected. The specific HI titers, IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgG subtypes were examined by ELISA. IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4 were test by ELISpot. In addition, two weeks after the last immunization, surivival after H3N2 virus lethal challenge was measured. Results: H3N2 split vaccine formulated with CTA1-DD could elicit higher IgM, IgG and hemagglutination inhibition titers in sera. Furthermore, using CTA1-DD as adjuvant significantly improved mucosal secretory IgA titers in bronchoalveolar lavages and vaginal lavages. Meanwhile this mucosal adjuvant could enhance Th-1-type responses and induce protective hemagglutination inhibition titers. Notably, the addition of CTA1-DD to split vaccine provided 100{\%} protection against lethal infection by the H3N2 virus. Conclusion: CTA1-DD could promote mucosal, humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, which supports the further development of CTA1-DD as a mucosal adjuvant for mucosal vaccines.},

@article{Farrell2019,
abstract = { Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) colonize blood-borne myeloid cells. Murine CMV (MCMV) spreads from the lungs via infected CD11c + cells, consistent with an important role for dendritic cells (DC). We show here that MCMV entering via the olfactory epithelium, a natural transmission portal, also spreads via infected DC. They reached lymph nodes, entered the blood via high endothelial venules, and then entered the salivary glands, driven by constitutive signaling of the viral M33 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Intraperitoneal infection also delivered MCMV to the salivary glands via DC. However, it also seeded F4/80 + infected macrophages to the blood; they did not enter the salivary glands or require M33 for extravasation. Instead, they seeded infection to a range of other sites, including brown adipose tissue (BAT). Peritoneal cells infected ex vivo then adoptively transferred showed similar cell type-dependent differences in distribution, with abundant F4/80 + cells in BAT and CD11c + cells in the salivary glands. BAT colonization by CMV-infected cells was insensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition of the GPCR signaling through G i/o substrate, whereas salivary gland colonization was sensitive. Since salivary gland infection required both M33 and G i/o -coupled signaling, whereas BAT infection required neither, these migrations were mechanistically distinct. MCMV spread from the lungs or nose depended on DC, controlled by M33. Infecting other monocyte populations resulted in unpredictable new infections.  IMPORTANCE Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) spread through the blood by infecting monocytes, and this can lead to disease. With murine CMV (MCMV) we can track infected myeloid cells and so understand how CMVs spread. Previous experiments have injected MCMV into the peritoneal cavity. MCMV normally enters mice via the olfactory epithelium. We show that olfactory infection spreads via dendritic cells, which MCMV directs to the salivary glands. Peritoneal infection similarly reached the salivary glands via dendritic cells. However, it also infected other monocyte types, and they spread infection to other tissues. Thus, infecting the “wrong” monocytes altered virus spread, with potential to cause disease. These results provide a basis for understanding how the monocyte types infected by human CMV might promote different infection outcomes. },

abstract = {Background: Early and accurate detection of respiratory viruses (RV) is important for patient management. We have previously shown that self-collected nasal swabs (NS) are feasible and as sensitive as clinician-collected nasal washes for detection of RV, but the additive benefit of self-collected throat swabs is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the added yield of self-collected nasal to throat swabs for detection of RV by PCR in patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Study design: Patients with URTI symptoms self-collected paired polyurethane foam NS and nylon flocked throat swabs and completed a symptom survey. Swabs were tested for 12 RV by real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Descriptive, McNemar's, and Wilcoxon signed rank statistical tests were used. Results: 115 paired nasal and throat swabs were collected from 63 individuals, with 71/115 (62{\%}) positive for a RV by at least one specimen, including 51 positive by both, 17 positive by NS only, and 3 positive by throat swab only. The sensitivity of NS was 96{\%} (95{\%}CI: 88-99) versus 76{\%} (95{\%} CI: 65-85) in throat swabs, p{\textless}0.001. The median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) in 51 concordant samples was lower (indicating higher viral concentration) in NS (25.1) versus throat swabs (32.0). The three samples positive only by throat swab had high Ct values (33.8, 36.2, and 38.8, all rhinovirus). Conclusion: Self-collection of NS was significantly more sensitive than self collection of throat swabs for detection of RV by RT-PCR. The addition of throat sampling does not appear to increase the diagnostic load in the self-testing setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increased illness due to antigenically drifted A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a influenza viruses prompted concerns about vaccine effectiveness (VE) and vaccine strain selection. We used US virologic surveillance and US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (Flu VE) Network data to evaluate consequences of this clade. METHODS: Distribution of influenza viruses was described using virologic surveillance data. The Flu VE Network enrolled ambulatory care patients aged ≥6 months with acute respiratory illness at 5 sites. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza by means of reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and were sequenced. Using a test-negative design, we estimated VE, comparing the odds of influenza among vaccinated versus unvaccinated participants. RESULTS: During the 2018-2019 influenza season, A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a viruses caused an increasing proportion of influenza cases. Among 2763 Flu VE Network case patients, 1325 (48{\%}) were infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1350 (49{\%}) with A(H3N2); clade 3C.3a accounted for 977 (93{\%}) of 1054 sequenced A(H3N2) viruses. VE was 44{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, 37{\%}-51{\%}) against A(H1N1)pdm09 and 9{\%} (-4{\%} to 20{\%}) against A(H3N2); VE was 5{\%} (-10{\%} to 19{\%}) against A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The predominance of A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a viruses during the latter part of the 2018-2019 season was associated with decreased VE, supporting the A(H3N2) vaccine component update for 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.},

abstract = {Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an established risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim was to establish cell lines from HPV-positive tonsil carcinomas to be used for treatment development. Methods: Fresh samples from 23 HPV-positive tonsil carcinomas were cultivated in vitro. The established cell line was analyzed for viral characteristics, cell karyotype, TP53 status, and growth capabilities in nude mice. In vitro studies of sensitivities to radiation, cisplatin and cetuximab were performed. Results: After 19 months (eight passages), one cell line, LU-HNSCC-26, was established in vitro and also grew as xenografts. The tumor was from a 48 year old non-smoking man with non-keratinizing, p16 positive tonsil OSCC, stage T2N0M0 with HPV16. It contained 19.5 (CV{\%} 3.7) HPV16 copies/cell (passage 8). The complete HPV16 genome sequence was obtained. Episomal HPV16 was present with an E2/E7 ratio of 1.1 (CV{\%} 2.6). In addition, HPV16 mRNA specific for the intact E2 gene was detected. The viral expression manifested 1.0 (CV{\%} 0.1) E7 mRNA copies per HPV16 genome. The karyotype was determined and the cell line demonstrated wild type TP53. The ID50 for radiation was 0.90 Gy and the IC50 for cisplatin was 0.99 $\mu$mol/L. The cell line was inhibited to a maximum of 18{\%} by cetuximab. Conclusions: We established an in vitro tonsil carcinoma cell line containing episomal HPV16. This is an important step towards efficient treatment development.},

abstract = {Background: Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, their characterization is incomplete because prevalence estimates are based on syndromic surveillance data. Here, we address this shortcoming through the analysis of infection rates among individuals tested regularly for respiratory viral infections, irrespective of their symptoms. Methods: We carried out longitudinal sampling and analysis among 214 individuals enrolled at multiple New York City locations from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined personal information with weekly nasal swab collection to investigate the prevalence of 18 respiratory viruses among different age groups and to assess risk factors associated with infection susceptibility. Results: 17.5{\%} of samples were positive for respiratory viruses. Some viruses circulated predominantly during winter, whereas others were found year round. Rhinovirus and coronavirus were most frequently detected. Children registered the highest positivity rates, and adults with daily contacts with children experienced significantly more infections than their counterparts without children. Conclusion: Respiratory viral infections are widespread among the general population with the majority of individuals presenting multiple infections per year. The observations identify children as the principal source of respiratory infections. These findings motivate further active surveillance and analysis of differences in pathogenicity among respiratory viruses.},

Current advice suggests that fever or new onset dry cough are the commonest presenting complaints. METHODOLOGY: We present a case report and case series as well as other evidence that there is an important fourth presenting syndrome, namely isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA), which should be considered highly suspicious for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A patient presenting with ISOA who went on to test positive for infection with COVID-19 and did not develop any further symptoms as well as a case series of similar patients although limited by the lack of reliable testing at the moment. CONCLUSIONS: We posit the existence of a fourth common syndrome of COVID-19 infection: isolated sudden onset anosmia (ISOA) and urge the international community to consider this presentation in current management advice.},

abstract = {Protecting against persistent viruses is an unsolved challenge. The clearest example for a gamma-herpesvirus is resistance to super-infection by Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4). Most experimental infections have delivered MuHV-4 into the lungs. A more likely natural entry site is the olfactory epithelium. Its protection remains unexplored. Here, prior exposure to olfactory MuHV-4 gave good protection against super-infection. The protection was upstream of B cell infection, which occurs in lymph nodes, and showed redundancy between antibody and T cells. Adding antibody to virions that blocked heparan binding strongly reduced olfactory host entry – unlike in the lungs, opsonized virions did not reach IgG Fc receptor + myeloid cells. However, the nasal antibody response to primary infection was too low to reduce host entry. Instead, the antibody acted downstream, reducing viral replication in the olfactory epithelium. This depended on IgG Fc receptor engagement rather than virion neutralization. Thus antibody can protect against natural $\gamma$-herpesvirus infection before it reaches B cells and independently of neutralization.},

abstract = {Recent worldwide outbreaks of enterovirus 71 (EV71) have caused major epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease with severe neurological complications, including acute flaccid paralysis. EV71 is transmitted by the enteral route, but little is known about the mechanisms it uses to cross the human gastrointestinal tract. Using primary human intestinal epithelial monolayers, we show that EV71 infects the epithelium from the apical surface, where it preferentially infects goblet cells. We found that EV71 infection did not alter epithelial barrier function but did reduce the expression of goblet cell–derived mucins, suggesting that it alters goblet cell function. We also show that the intestinal epithelium responds to EV71 infection through the selective induction of type III interferons (IFNs), which restrict EV71 replication. Collectively, these findings define the early events associated with EV71 infections of the human intestinal epithelium and show that host IFN signaling controls replication in an IFN-specific manner.},

abstract = {Nasopharyngeal colonization with nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a prerequisite for developing NTHi-associated infections, including otitis media. Therapies that block NTHi colonization may prevent disease development. We previously demonstrated that Haemophilus haemolyticus, a closely related human commensal, can inhibit NTHi colonization and infection of human respiratory epithelium in vitro We have now assessed whether Muribacter muris (a rodent commensal from the same family) can prevent NTHi colonization and disease in vivo using a murine NTHi otitis media model. Otitis media was modeled in BALB/c mice using coinfection with 1 × 10(4.5) PFU of influenza A virus MEM H3N2, followed by intranasal challenge with 5 × 10(7) CFU of NTHi R2866 Spec(r) Mice were pretreated or not with an intranasal inoculation of 5 × 10(7) CFU M. muris 24 h before coinfection. NTHi and M. muris viable counts and inflammatory mediators (gamma interferon [IFN-$\gamma$], interleukin-1$\beta$ [IL-1$\beta$], IL-6, keratinocyte chemoattractant [KC], and IL-10) were measured in nasal washes and middle ear tissue homogenate. M. muris pretreatment decreased the median colonization density of NTHi from 6 × 10(5) CFU/ml to 9 × 10(3) CFU/ml (P = 0.0004). Only 1/12 M. muris-pretreated mice developed otitis media on day 5 compared to 8/15 mice with no pretreatment (8{\%} versus 53{\%}, P = 0.0192). Inflammation, clinical score, and weight loss were also lower in M. muris-pretreated mice. We have demonstrated that a single dose of a closely related commensal can delay onset of NTHi otitis media in vivo Human challenge studies investigating prevention of NTHi colonization are warranted to reduce the global burden of otitis media and other NTHi diseases.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent reports suggest that sudden smell loss might be a symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom "sudden smell loss" for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7{\%} for the symptom "sudden smell loss" in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom "sudden smell loss" can be attested a high specificity (97{\%}) and a sensitivity of 65{\%} with a positive predictive value of 63{\%} and negative predictive value of 97{\%} for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.},

abstract = {Background: Rhinovirus (RV) infections exacerbate asthma in part by enhancing an allergic state, and these exacerbations can be mitigated via administration of anti-IgE. Objective: We investigated the presence of local IgE production in the nose of allergic and non-allergic subjects and assessed whether this was enhanced by RV. Methods: Local production of specific IgE was determined by comparing ratios of specific to total IgE concentrations between nasal and serum samples. Our initial studies were performed in subjects presenting to the emergency department for allergic and non-allergic respiratory complaints. Subsequently, we investigated influences of experimental RV infection on nasal sIgE production in an allergic cohort. Results: We found evidence of local sIgE production to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in 30.3{\%} and to Blomia tropicalis in 14.6{\%} of allergic subjects. None of the non-allergic subjects demonstrated local IgE. Subjects with active RV infection were more than twice as likely to have local sIgE (45{\%} vs 14{\%}), and subjects with local sIgE being produced were {\~{}}3 times more likely to be having an asthma exacerbation. Experimental RV infection was able to induce local sIgE production. Conclusion: These studies confirm local IgE production in a large subset of allergic subjects and demonstrate that allergic asthmatics with local IgE are more likely to develop an asthma exacerbation when infected with RV. Our RV challenge studies demonstrate that at least some allergic asthmatics can be induced to secrete locally generated IgE in their nasal airway after RV infection.},

abstract = {Our objective was to assess the presence of three polyomaviruses, namely SV40, JCPyV, and BKPyV, and human papillomaviruses (HPV) in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC) of the minor salivary glands (MiSG) in the head and neck region. The study comprised 68 MiSG ACC patients operated during 1974–2012 at the Helsinki University Hospital (Helsinki, Finland). Medical records and 68 histological samples were reviewed. Polyomaviruses were detected with quantitative PCR and the DNA-positive samples were further analyzed for the presence of viral tumor T antigen (T-ag) with immunohistochemistry. HPV genotyping was performed with a Multiplex HPV Genotyping Kit. Only JCPyV DNA was found in ACC samples, being present in 7 (10.3{\%}) out of the 68 samples. The viral load of JCPyV was low varying between 1 to 226 copies/$\mu$g DNA. The JCPyV-positive samples originated from trachea (two samples), paranasal sinuses (one), and oral cavity (two). Additionally, JCPyV positivity was found in one lung metastasis of a tracheal tumor and one local disease failure of an oral cavity tumor. Three JCPyV DNA-positive samples showed weak nuclear staining for large T-ag. In conclusion, only JCPyV but not SV40, BKPyV, or HPV was found in ACC from the upper and lower airways. JCPyV copy numbers were low which might support its role as a “hit and run agent” in ACC carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Background: Internet-based participatory surveillance systems, such as the German GrippeWeb, monitor the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses on population level. In order to interpret syndromic information better, we devised a microbiological feasibility study (GrippeWeb-Plus) to test whether self-collection of anterior nasal swabs is operationally possible, acceptable for participants and can yield valid data. Methods: We recruited 103 GrippeWeb participants (73 adults and 30 children) and provided them with a kit, instructions and a questionnaire for each sample. In the first half of 2016, participants took an anterior nasal swab and sent it to the Robert Koch Institute whenever an acute respiratory illness occurred. Reporting of illnesses through the GrippeWeb platform continued as usual. We analysed swabs for the presence of human c-myc-DNA and 22 viral and bacterial pathogens. After the study, we sent participants an evaluation questionnaire. We analysed timeliness, completeness, acceptability and validity. Results: One hundred and two participants submitted 225 analysable swabs. Ninety per cent of swabs were taken within 3 days of symptom onset. Eighty-nine per cent of swabs had a corresponding reported illness in the GrippeWeb system. Ninety-nine per cent of adults and 96{\%} of children would be willing to participate in a self-swabbing scheme for a longer period. All swabs contained c-myc-DNA. In 119 swabs, we identified any of 14 viruses but no bacteria. The positivity rate of influenza was similar to that in the German physician sentinel. Conclusion: Self-collection of anterior nasal swabs proofed to be feasible, was well accepted by participants, gave valid results and was an informative adjunct to syndromic data.},

abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one third of human patients. In recent years, several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prophylaxis in prospective human epidemics. In the current study, eight human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing and non-neutralizing capabilities, directed against different epitopes of the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (MERS-S) protein, were investigated with regard to their ability to immunohistochemically detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV experimentally infected alpacas. The most intense immunoreaction was detected using a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain S1B of the MERS-S protein, which produced an immunosignal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and along the apical membranous region. A similar staining was obtained by two other mAbs which recognize the sialic acid-binding domain and the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2, respectively. Five mAbs lacked immunoreactivity for MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue, even though they belong, at least in part, to the same epitope group. In summary, three tested human mAbs demonstrated capacity for detection of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE samples and may be implemented in double or triple immunohistochemical methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of YouTube videos in Spanish on the basic measures to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: On 18 March 2020, a search was conducted on YouTube using the terms "Prevencion Coronavirus" and "Prevencion COVID-19". We studied the associations between the type of authorship and the country of publication with other variables (such as the number of likes and basic measures to prevent COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization, among others) with univariate analysis and a multiple logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 129 videos were evaluated; 37.2{\%} were produced in Mexico (25.6{\%}) and Spain (11.6{\%}), and 56.6{\%} were produced by mass media, including television and newspapers. The most frequently reported basic preventive measure was hand washing (71.3{\%}), and the least frequent was not touching the eyes, nose, and mouth (24.0{\%}). Hoaxes (such as eating garlic or citrus to prevent COVID-19) were detected in 15 videos (10.9{\%}). In terms of authorship, papers produced by health professionals had a higher probability of reporting hand hygiene (OR (95{\%} CI) = 4.20 (1.17-15.09)) and respiratory hygiene (OR (95{\%} CI) = 3.05 (1.22-7.62)) as preventive measures. CONCLUSION: Information from YouTube in Spanish on basic measures to prevent COVID-19 is usually not very complete and differs according to the type of authorship. Our findings make it possible to guide Spanish-speaking users on the characteristics of the videos to be viewed in order to obtain reliable information.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The internet is a large source of health information and has the capacity to influence its users. However, the information found on the internet often lacks scientific rigor, as anyone may upload content. This factor is a cause of great concern to scientific societies, governments, and users. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate the information about the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the internet. METHODS: On February 29, 2020, we performed a Google search with the terms "Prevention coronavirus," "Prevention COVID-19," "Prevenci{\'{o}}n coronavirus," and "Prevenci{\'{o}}n COVID-19". A univariate analysis was performed to study the association between the type of authorship, country of publication, and recommendations to avoid COVID-19 according to the World Health Organization (WHO). RESULTS: In total, 80 weblinks were reviewed. Most of them were produced in the United States and Spain (n=58, 73{\%}) by digital media sources and official public health organizations (n=60, 75{\%}). The most mentioned WHO preventive measure was "wash your hands frequently" (n=65, 81{\%}). A less frequent recommendation was to "stay home if you feel unwell" (n=26, 33{\%}). The analysis by type of author (official public health organizations versus digital media) revealed significant differences regarding the recommendation to wear a mask when you are healthy only if caring for a person with suspected COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 4.39). According to the country of publication (Spain versus the United States), significant differences were detected regarding some recommendations such as "wash your hands frequently" (OR 9.82), "cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze" (OR 4.59), or "stay home if you feel unwell" (OR 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to urge and promote the use of the websites of official public health organizations when seeking information on COVID-19 preventive measures on the internet. In this way, users will be able to obtain high-quality information more frequently, and such websites may improve their accessibility and positioning, given that search engines justify the positioning of links obtained in a search based on the frequency of access to them.},

abstract = {Rapid identification of pathogenic agents is important in response to the emergence of biocrime and bioterrorism, to facilitate appropriate confinement and treatment. As the rapid determination system of viral genome sequences (RDV method) using exhaustive gene amplification is useful for rapid identification, we examined whether this method could be applied to forensic samples. To detect pathogenic virus in a cat with suspected viral infections, fluid swab samples were applied to the RDV method. The following steps were performed: viral propagation, extraction of the viral genome, amplification of the first library, fragmentation of the library, amplification of the second library using non-specific primer sets, and direct sequencing of the amplicon. To confirm the viruses detected by this method, we performed conventional PCR using virus-specific primers. We detected pathogenic virus genome sequences from the swab samples and confirmed infection with these viruses. In addition, we directly detected a viral genome sequence from the nasal swab sample without the viral propagation step. The RDV method is infrequently used in forensic analysis. This method is practicable with equipment existing in a normal laboratory and is useful for rapid detection and identification of pathogenic viruses in forensic samples. This method would also be applicable to the detection of bacteria and fungi.},

abstract = {The mode of acquisition and causes for the variable clinical spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unknown. We utilized a reverse genetics system to generate a GFP reporter virus to explore severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pathogenesis and a luciferase reporter virus to demonstrate sera collected from SARS and COVID-19 patients exhibited limited cross-CoV neutralization. High-sensitivity RNA in situ mapping revealed the highest angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression in the nose with decreasing expression throughout the lower respiratory tract, paralleled by a striking gradient of SARS-CoV-2 infection in proximal (high) versus distal (low) pulmonary epithelial cultures. COVID-19 autopsied lung studies identified focal disease and, congruent with culture data, SARS-CoV-2-infected ciliated and type 2 pneumocyte cells in airway and alveolar regions, respectively. These findings highlight the nasal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 with likely subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding to the lung in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. These reagents provide a foundation for investigations into virus-host interactions in protective immunity, host susceptibility, and virus pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Aim: This study explored the clinical features of nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) in patients with prominent ocular symptoms and those with general nasal NKTL to improve the early diagnosis of nasal NKTL. Method: A retrospective cohort study was performed with 278 patients with nasal NKTL admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between January 2011 and December 2017. Of these cases, 56 presented with nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms, and 222 presented with general nasal NKTL. Results: No significant differences in gender and age distribution were found between patients with general nasal NKTL and those with nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Cases of nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms were usually complicated with B symptoms(48.2{\%} vs 32.9{\%}, p {\textless} 0.05). Patients with nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms were more likely to progress to stage III disease (p {\textless} 0.01). The median time from first onset to diagnosis was 2.5 months. Most patients with general nasal NKTL had a longer history (69.6{\%} vs 45.0{\%}, p {\textless} 0.01). The misdiagnosis rate of the first visit of patients with general nasal NKTL was 29.3{\%}, and that of patients with prominent ocular symptoms was 51.8{\%}; this difference was significant (p {\textless} 0.01). Patients with nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms showed a higher positive rate of EBV DNA (p {\textless} 0.01), which was significantly associated with staging (p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Compared with patients with general nasal NKTL, the early diagnosis of patients with prominent ocular symptoms is difficult and easy to misdiagnose. Patients with nasal NKTL and prominent ocular symptoms mostly present with advanced disease stages, and most patients have B symptoms and a high positive rate of EBV DNA.},

abstract = {Enzootic nasal tumor virus 2 (ENTV-2), the aetiological agent of enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma in goats, is prevalent in China; resulting in substantial economic losses to the goat-breeding industry. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an efficient detection method for the diagnosis and prevention of ENTV-2 infection. More recently, EvaGreen is emerging as a novel alternative fluorescent dye for quantitative real-time PCR because of its low cost, specific amplification and high resolution. In this study, we developed a specific, sensitive, and cost-effective detection method-an EvaGreen-based real-time PCR assay for the detection of ENTV-2. This assay exhibited high specificity and sensitivity and was able to detect ENTV-2 at concentrations as low as 3.0 × 10 1 copies, which was more sensitive than the conventional PCR method (detection limit, 3.0 × 10 2 copies). In addition, the reproducibility test indicated that EvaGreen dye in our assay had a good reproducibility. In conclusion, we report that a highly sensitive, specific, and cost-effective EvaGreen-based real-time PCR assay is successful for the rapid detection of ENTV-2.},

Objective: To characterize high-risk HPV genotypes (HPV-HR) in histologically confirmed ear, nose and throat (ENT) cancers in Ouagadougou. Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight archived tissues from the ENT sphere, obtained over the last ten years (2007 to 2017) and histologically diagnosed in anatomy and pathology-cytology laboratories in Ouagadougou were included. These tissues were dewaxed with xylene; HPV DNA extraction was performed and HPV-HR were researched by real-time multiplex PCR. Results: Among the fourteen HPV-HR genotypes tested for, seven were identified. The prevalence of HPV-HR infection was 15.6{\%}. The most common genotypes were: HPV56 (45{\%}) and HPV33 (20{\%}). Squamous cell carcinomas accounted for 75{\%} of cases, followed by lymphomas for 10{\%}. The age range was between 5 and 80 years. Conclusion: The results show the involvement of a diversity of HPV-HR genotypes and a high frequency of HPV56 and HPV33 in ENT cancers in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The appropriate HPV vaccination will considerably reduce the number of these cancers.},

JSRV and ENTV-1 are found in many countries worldwide and have a significant economic and animal health impact. Although JSRV is endemic in sheep in the British Isles, ENTV-1 has not been reported. We report herein a nasal adenocarcinoma in a cull 8-y-old Belclare ewe from Ireland. The gross and microscopic features and immunohistochemistry results were consistent with an ENTV-1-associated tumor. However, differential PCR, using primers specific to regions of divergent sequence between the viruses, was performed on different parts of the adenocarcinoma and produced consistent results: positive for JSRV and negative for ENTV-1. An association of JSRV with nasal adenocarcinoma in sheep has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. Our case shows the necessity of using PCR in combination with immunohistochemistry to reach an accurate etiologic diagnosis, which is of importance in countries currently free of ENTV-1.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Olfactory dysfunction has shown to accompany COVID-19. There are varying data regarding the exact frequency in the various study population. The outcome of the olfactory impairment is also not clearly defined. OBJECTIVE: To find the frequency of olfactory impairment and its outcome in hospitalized patients with positive swab test for COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective descriptive study of 100 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, randomly sampled, from February to March 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory findings were analyzed according to the olfactory loss or sinonasal symptoms. The olfactory impairment and sinonasal symptoms were evaluated by 9 Likert scale questions asked from the patients. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients completed the follow-up (means 20.1 (± 7.42) days). Twenty-two (23.91{\%}) patients complained of olfactory loss and in 6 (6.52{\%}) patients olfactory loss was the first symptom of the disease. The olfactory loss was reported to be completely resolved in all but one patient. Thirty-nine (42.39{\%}) patients had notable sinonasal symptoms while rhinorrhea was the first symptom in 3 (3.26{\%}). Fifteen patients (16.3{\%}) had a taste impairment. Patients with sinonasal symptoms had a lower age (p = 0.01). There was no significant relation between olfactory loss and sinonasal symptoms (p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: Sudden olfactory dysfunction and sinonasal symptoms have a considerable prevalence in patients with COVID-19. No significant association was noted between the sinonasal symptoms and the olfactory loss, which may suggest that other mechanisms beyond upper respiratory tract involvement are responsible for the olfactory loss.},

abstract = {Rationale Goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH) is one of the cardinal features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contributes to airways obstruction. Rhinovirus (RV), which causes acute exacerbations in patients with COPD, also causes prolonged airways obstruction. Previously, we showed that RV enhances mucin gene expression and increases goblet cell number in a COPD mouse model. This study examines whether RV causes sustained GCH in relevant models of COPD. Methods Mucociliary-differentiated COPD and normal airway epithelial cell cultures and mice with normal or COPD phenotype were infected with RV or sham and examined for GCH by immunofluorescence and/or mucin gene expression. In some experiments, RV-infected COPD cells and mice with COPD phenotype were treated with $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor or interleukin-13 neutralising antibody and assessed for GCH. To determine the contribution of NOTCH1/3 in RV-induced GCH, COPD cells transduced with NOTCH1/3 shRNA were used. Results RV-infected COPD, but not normal cell cultures, showed sustained GCH and increased mucin genes expression. Microarray analysis indicated increased expression of NOTCH1, NOTCH3 and HEY1 only in RV-infected COPD cells. Blocking NOTCH3, but not NOTCH1, attenuated RV-induced GCH in vitro. Inhibition of NOTCH signalling by $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor, but not neutralising antibody to IL-13, abrogated RV-induced GCH and mucin gene expression. Conclusions RV induces sustained GCH via NOTCH3 particularly in COPD cells or mice with COPD phenotype. This may be one of the mechanisms that may contribute to RV-induced prolonged airways obstruction in COPD.},

abstract = {A novel coronavirus (CoV), the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus - 2 (SARS-CoV-2), results in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As information concerning the COVID-19 disease continues to evolve, patients look to their eye care practitioners for accurate eye health guidance. There is currently no evidence to suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 through contact lens (CL) wear compared to spectacle lens wear and no scientific evidence that wearing standard prescription spectacles provides protection against COVID-19 or other viral transmissions. During the pandemic there will potentially be significant changes in access to local eyecare. Thus, it is imperative CL wearers are reminded of the steps they should follow to minimise their risk of complications, to reduce their need to leave isolation and seek care. Management of adverse events should be retained within optometric systems if possible, to minimise the impact on the wider healthcare service, which will be stretched. Optimal CL care behaviours should be the same as those under normal circumstances, which include appropriate hand washing (thoroughly with soap and water) and drying (with paper towels) before both CL application and removal. Daily CL cleaning and correct case care for reusable CL should be followed according to appropriate guidelines, and CL exposure to water must be avoided. Where the availability of local clinical care is restricted, practitioners could consider advising patients to reduce or eliminate sleeping in their CL (where patients have the appropriate knowledge about correct daily care and access to suitable lens-care products) or consider the option of moving patients to daily disposable lenses (where patients have appropriate lens supplies available). Patients should also avoid touching their face, including their eyes, nose and mouth, with unwashed hands and avoid CL wear altogether if unwell (particularly with any cold or flu-like symptoms).},

abstract = {Background: Influenza A virus in swine (IAV-S) causes an acute respiratory disease of swine which results in great economic losses. A bivalent H1N1 and H3N2, NS1-truncated live-attenuated IAV-S vaccine (LAIV, Ingelvac Provenza ™ ) has recently become available. Objective: Reduction of shedding during an outbreak in the nursery or finisher is an important parameter from an epidemiological control strategy; therefore, a laboratory efficacy study was conducted to evaluate nasal virus shedding when vaccinated pigs were challenged with either heterologous H1N2 or H3N2 strains 12 weeks post-vaccination. Methods: Between 1 and 5 days of age, pigs born to IAV-S seronegative dams were intranasally administered 1 mL of vaccine or saline. At 30 days post-vaccination, pigs were weaned and randomized into two different challenge groups consisting of vaccinated pigs and control pigs commingled within pens for the two challenge groups. At 85 days post-vaccination, pigs in the first group were challenged with A/Swine/North Carolina/001169/2006 H1N2 challenge strain, and the second group was challenged with A/Swine/Nebraska/97901-10/2008 H3N2. Nasal swabs were collected daily for five days and tested by virus isolation. Results and conclusion: This study showed significant reduction in nasal virus shedding with regard to both frequency and duration. A 1 mL intranasal dose of Ingelvac Provenza ™ given as early as 1 day of age showed protection for at least 12 weeks later as evidenced by the reduction of shedding live, viable virus after challenge with either a heterologous H1N2 strain or a heterologous H3N2 strain.},

abstract = {Dromedary camels are natural host of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). However, there are limited studies of MERS-CoV infection of other domestic mammals exposed to infected dromedaries. We expanded our surveillance among camels in Egypt, Tunisia, and Senegal to include other domestic mammalian species in contact with infected camels. A total of 820 sera and 823 nasal swabs from cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses were collected. Swabs were tested using RT-PCR and virus RNA-positive samples were genetically sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Sera were screened using virus microneutralization tests and positive sera (where available) were confirmed using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). We detected 90{\%} PRNT confirmed MERS-CoV antibody in 35 (55.6{\%}) of 63 sera from sheep collected from Senegal, two sheep (1.8{\%}) of 114 in Tunisia and a goat (0.9{\%}) of 107 in Egypt, with titres ranging from 1:80 to ≥1:320. We detected MERS-CoV RNA in swabs from three sheep (1.2{\%}) of 254 and five goats (4.1{\%}) of 121 from Egypt and Senegal, as well as one cow (1.9{\%}) of 53 and three donkeys (7.1{\%}) of 42 from Egypt. Partial sequences of the RT-PCR amplicons confirmed specificity of the results. This study showed that domestic livestock in contact with MERS-CoV infected camels may be at risk of infection. We recommend expanding current MERS-CoV surveillance in animals to include other livestock in close contact with dromedary camels. The segregation of camels from other livestock in farms and live animal markets may need to be considered.},

abstract = {During the initial pandemic wave of COVID-19, apart from common presenting symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue), many countries have reported a sudden increase in the number of smell and taste dysfunction patients. Smell dysfunction has been reported in other viral infections (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, SARS, and others), but the incidence is much lower than SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathophysiology of post-infectious olfactory loss was hypothesized that viruses may produce an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa or damage the olfactory neuroepithelium directly. However, loss of smell could be presented in COVID-19 patients without other rhinologic symptoms or significant nasal inflammation. This review aims to provide a brief overview of recent evidence for epidemiology, pathological mechanisms for the smell, and taste dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Furthermore, prognosis and treatments are reviewed with scanty evidence. We also discuss the possibility of using "smell and taste loss" as a screening tool for COVID-19 and treatment options in the post-SARS-CoV-2 infectious olfactory loss.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parechovirus and enterovirus belong to a family of Picornaviridae, non- enveloped, small-sized RNA viruses, responsible for multiple human diseases. Recent introduction of molecular tests enabled the identi cation of parechovirus and enterovirus infections. Our aim was a retrospective analysis of signs and symptoms associated with confirmed parechovirus or enterovirus infections among children treated in the Department of Neonatology, St. Louis Regional Children's Hospital in Krak{\'{o}}w, Poland. METHODS: Based on laboratory records, we identified all cases of parecho- or enterovirus infections confirmed by identification of viral RNA in nasal swab or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Hospital records and laboratory tests results of selected patients were then analyzed, and selected data were summarized, with emphasis on clinical and laboratory findings at admission. RESULTS: We identified 11 cases of parechovirus and three of enterovirus infections. All cases were neonates admitted to hospital with fever and irritability. Except for leukopenia in 50{\%} of patients, no significant abnormalities were noted in blood counts and serum biochemistry, including low C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. In nine cases, cerebrospinal fluid was collected, the fluid protein concentrations and cell counts were moderately increased. Final diagnosis was meningitis in 12 children, and other viral infections in two. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection, including parecho- and enteroviruses, should be considered in the etiology of fever and meningitis in neonates. The available molecular tests allow for detection of viral genetic material even in a scant biological specimen collected from neonates.},

abstract = {Background: Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is an important respiratory pathogen worldwide, detrimentally affecting the economy and animal welfare. To prevent and control BRSV infection, further knowledge on virus shedding and transmission potential in individual animals is required. This study aimed to detect viral RNA and infective virions during BRSV infection to evaluate duration of the transmission period and correlation with clinical signs of disease. The outcome of BRSV re-exposure on calves, their housing environment and effect of introduction of sentinel calves was also investigated. A live animal experiment including 10 calves was conducted over 61 days. Initially, two calves were inoculated with a non-passaged BRSV field isolate. Two days later, six na{\"{i}}ve calves (EG: Exposed group) were introduced for commingling and four weeks later, another two na{\"{i}}ve calves (SG: Sentinel group) were introduced. Seven weeks after commingling, EG animals were re-inoculated. Clinical examination was performed daily. Nasal swabs were collected regularly and analysed for viral RNA by RT-ddPCR, while virus isolation was performed in cell culture. BRSV serology was performed with ELISA. Results: All the EG calves seroconverted and showed clinical signs of respiratory disease. Viral RNA was detected from days 1-27 after exposure, while the infective virus was isolated on day 6 and 13. On day 19, all animals were seropositive and virus could not be isolated. Total clinical score for respiratory signs corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA. The SG animals, introduced 27 days after exposure, remained negative for BRSV RNA and stayed seronegative throughout the study. Inoculation of the EG calves seven weeks after primary infection did not lead to new shedding of viral RNA or clinical signs of disease. Conclusion: Viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs from the calves up to four weeks after exposure. The detection and amount of viral RNA corresponded well with the degree of respiratory signs. The calves were shedding infective virions for a considerable shorter period, and na{\"{i}}ve calves introduced after four weeks were not infected. Infected calves were protected from reinfection for at least seven weeks. This knowledge is useful to prevent spread of BRSV.},

abstract = {The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious zoonosis produced by SARS-CoV-2 that is spread human-to-human by respiratory secretions. It was declared by the WHO as a public health emergency. The most susceptible populations, needing mechanical ventilation, are the elderly and people with associated comorbidities. There is an important risk of contagion for anesthetists, dentists, head and neck surgeons, maxillofacial surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists. Health workers represent between 3.8{\%} and 20{\%} of the infected population; some 15{\%} will develop severe complaints and among them, many will lose their lives. A large number of patients do not have overt signs and symptoms (fever/respiratory), yet pose a real risk to surgeons (who should know this fact and must therefore apply respiratory protective strategies for all patients they encounter). All interventions that have the potential to aerosolize aerodigestive secretions should be avoided or used only when mandatory. Health workers who are: pregnant, over 55 to 65 years of age, with a history of chronic diseases (uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and all clinical scenarios where immunosuppression is feasible, including that induced to treat chronic inflammatory conditions and organ transplants) should avoid the clinical attention of a potentially infected patient. Health care facilities should prioritize urgent and emergency visits and procedures until the present condition stabilizes; truly elective care should cease and discussed on a case-by-case basis for patients with cancer. For those who are working with COVID-19 infected patients' isolation is compulsory in the following settings: (a) unprotected close contact with COVID-19 pneumonia patients; (b) onset of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms (gastrointestinal complaints, anosmia, and dysgeusia have been reported in a minority of cases). For any care or intervention in the upper aerodigestive tract region, irrespective of the setting and a confirmed diagnosis (eg, rhinoscopy or flexible laryngoscopy in the outpatient setting and tracheostomy or rigid endoscopy under anesthesia), it is strongly recommended that all health care personnel wear personal protective equipment such as N95, gown, cap, eye protection, and gloves. The procedures described are essential in trying to maintain safety of health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, otolaryngologists, head and neck, and maxillofacial surgeons are per se exposed to the greatest risk of infection while caring for COVID-19 positive subjects, and their protection should be considered a priority in the present circumstances.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Otorhinolaryngological manifestations are common symptoms of COVID-19. This study provides a brief and precise review of the current knowledge regarding COVID-19, including disease transmission, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and potential treatment. The article focused on COVID-19-related information useful in otolaryngologist practice. METHODS: The Medline and Web of Science databases were searched without a time limit using terms "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2" in conjunction with "otorhinolaryngological manifestation", "ENT", and "olfaction". RESULTS: The most common otolaryngological dysfunctions of COVID-19 were cough, sore throat, and dyspnea. Rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dizziness were also present. COVID-19 could manifest as an isolated sudden hyposmia/anosmia. Upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms were commonly observed in younger patients and usually appeared initially. They could be present even before the molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. Otolaryngologists are of great risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 as they cope with URT. ENT surgeons could be easily infected by SARS-CoV-2 during performing surgery in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) symptoms may precede the development of severe COVID-19. During COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cough, sore throat, dyspnea, hyposmia/anosmia and a history of travel to the region with confirmed COVID-19 patients, should be considered as potential COVID-19 cases. An otolaryngologist should wear FFP3/N95 mask, glasses, disposable and fluid resistant gloves and gown while examining such individuals. Not urgent ENT surgeries should be postponed. Additional studies analyzing why some patients develop ENT symptoms during COVID-19 and others do not are needed. Further research is needed to determine the mechanism leading to anosmia.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To detect the presence of viral RNA of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in conjunctival swab specimens of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: Forty-five COVID-19 patients positive for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab with or without ocular manifestations were included in the study. The conjunctival swab of each patient was collected by an ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. RESULTS: Out of 45 patients, 35 (77.77{\%}) were males and the rest were females. The mean age was 31.26 ± 12.81 years. None of the patients had any ocular manifestations. One (2.23{\%}) out of 45 patients was positive for RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 in the conjunctival swab. CONCLUSION: This study shows that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in conjunctival swabs of confirmed cases of COVID-19 patients. Though the positivity rate of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in conjunctival swabs is very less, care should be exercised during the ocular examination of patients of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Mammalian Bornavirus (BoDV-1) typically causes a fatal neurologic disorder in horses and sheep, and was recently shown to cause fatal encephalitis in humans with and without transplant reception. It has been suggested that BoDV-1 enters the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory pathway. However, (I) susceptible cell types that replicate the virus for successful spread, and (II) the role of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), remained unclear. To address this, we studied the intranasal infection of adult rats with BoDV-1 in vivo and in vitro, using olfactory mucosal (OM) cell cultures and the cultures of purified OECs. Strikingly, in vitro and in vivo, viral antigen and mRNA were present from four days post infection (dpi) onwards in the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), but also in all other cell types of the OM, and constantly in the OECs. In contrast, in vivo, BoDV-1 genomic RNA was only detectable in adult and juvenile ORNs, nerve fibers, and in OECs from 7 dpi on. In vitro, the rate of infection of OECs was significantly higher than that of the OM cells, pointing to a crucial role of OECs for infection via the olfactory pathway. Thus, this study provides important insights into the transmission of neurotropic viral infections with a zoonotic potential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID 2019, SARS-CoV2) started in Wuhan, Hubei, in China at the end of December 2019. The French government decided to repatriate the 337 French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. We decided to test them all for SARS-Cov2 twice in order to reduce anxiety among the population and decision-makers. METHODS: We investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 in asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated patients within the first 24 h of their arrival in France and at day 5. Viral RNA was extracted from pooled nasal and oropharyngeal swab fluids or sputum in the absence of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then carried out using several real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays. RESULTS: We tested 337 passengers at day 0 and day 5. All the tests for SARS-CoV2 were negative. By optimising the sampling process, sending samples sequentially and reducing the time-scale for biological analysis, we were able to test the samples within 5 h (including sampling, shipment and biological tests). CONCLUSION: Optimising our procedures reduces anxiety and reassures the population and decision makers.},

METHODS: A nation-wide workgroup drew guidelines based on clinical experience, national and local recommendations and scientific literature. Proposals may have to be updated on a day-to-day basis. RESULTS: In children, incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 (1-5{\%}) is low and of good prognosis. The indications for nasal flexible endoscopy should be drastically limited. If undertaken, full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) including FFP2 masks are required, as well as use of a sheath. Saline nose wash done by caregivers other than parents at home should require PPE. Unless foreign body tracheobronchial aspiration is clinically obvious, CT-scan should be performed to confirm indication of endoscopy. Surgical indications should be limited to emergencies and to cases that cannot be delayed beyond 2 months (especially endonasal, endopharyngeal laryngo-tracheobronchial procedures). Postponement should ideally be a group decision and recorded as such in the medical file. Surgical techniques should be adapted to limit the risk of viral dissemination in the air, avoiding the use of drills, microdebriders, monopolar cautery or lasers. Continuous suction should be placed near the operating field. In case of confirmed Covid-19 cases, or suspected cases (or in some centres systematically), PPE with FFP2 mask should be worn by all staff members present in the operating room.},

Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Objective OD was evaluated using psychophysical tests. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients completed the study. The most common symptoms were fatigue (72.9{\%}), headache (60.0{\%}), nasal obstruction (58.6{\%}), and postnasal drip (48.6{\%}). Total loss of smell was self-reported by 61.4{\%} of patients. Objective olfactory testings identified 41 anosmic (47.7{\%}), 12 hyposmic (14.0{\%}), and 33 normosmic (38.3{\%}) patients. There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection were recruited from 12 European hospitals. The following epidemiological and clinical outcomes have been studied: age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and general and otolaryngological symptoms. Patients completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires based on the smell and taste component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (sQOD-NS). RESULTS: A total of 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients completed the study (263 females). The most prevalent general symptoms consisted of cough, myalgia, and loss of appetite. Face pain and nasal obstruction were the most disease-related otolaryngological symptoms. 85.6{\%} and 88.0{\%} of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. There was a significant association between both disorders (p {\textless} 0.001). Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8{\%} of cases. The sQO-NS scores were significantly lower in patients with anosmia compared with normosmic or hyposmic individuals (p = 0.001). Among the 18.2{\%} of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7{\%} were hyposmic or anosmic. The early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0{\%}. Females were significantly more affected by olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions than males (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Olfactory and gustatory disorders are prevalent symptoms in European COVID-19 patients, who may not have nasal symptoms. The sudden anosmia or ageusia need to be recognized by the international scientific community as important symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.},

abstract = {Influenza is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, vaccine effectiveness has been low to moderate in recent years and vaccine coverage remains low, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Supplementary methods of prevention should be explored to reduce the high burden of influenza. A potential target is the respiratory tract microbiome, complex microbial communities which envelop the respiratory epithelium and play an important role in shaping host immunity. Using a household transmission study, we examined whether the nose/throat microbiota was associated with influenza susceptibility among participants exposed to influenza virus in the household. Further, we characterized changes in the nose/throat microbiota to explore whether community stability was influenced by influenza virus infection. Using a generalized linear mixed effects model, we found a nasal/oropharyngeal community state type (CST) associated with decreased susceptibility to influenza. The CST was rare and transitory among young children but a prevalent and stable CST among adults. Using boosting and linear mixed effects models, we found associations between the nose/throat microbiota and influenza also existed at the taxa level, specifically with the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Prevotella, and Bacteroides oligotypes. We found high rates of change between bacterial community states among both secondary cases and household contacts who were not infected during follow up. Further work is needed to separate the effect of influenza virus infection from the considerable short-term changes that occur even in the absence of virus. Lastly, age was strongly associated with susceptibility to influenza and the nose/throat bacterial community structure. Although additional studies are needed to determine causality, our results suggest the nose/throat microbiome may be a potential target for reducing the burden of influenza.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission. FINDINGS: From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52{\%}) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28{\%}) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9{\textperiodcentered}42 [95{\%} CI 6{\textperiodcentered}56-10{\textperiodcentered}02]; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001), being male (1{\textperiodcentered}67 [1{\textperiodcentered}19-2{\textperiodcentered}34]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1{\textperiodcentered}95 [1{\textperiodcentered}36-2{\textperiodcentered}80]; p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}001) and cardiovascular disease (2{\textperiodcentered}32 [1{\textperiodcentered}47-3{\textperiodcentered}64]). 281 (35{\%}) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1{\textperiodcentered}18 [0{\textperiodcentered}81-1{\textperiodcentered}72]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

This study utilized the National Library of Medicine's PubMed/MEDLINE database to query for articles describing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and other coronaviruses, with any mention of smell, taste, or other chemosensory or sinonasal dysfunction. Aggregate analysis demonstrated an incidence of 49.6{\%} (n = 497 of 1002; 95{\%} CI, 46.5{\%}-52.7{\%}), 47.9{\%} (n = 480 of 1002; 95{\%} CI, 44.8{\%}-51.0{\%}), and 17.9{\%} (n = 880 of 4909; 95{\%} CI, 16.9{\%}-19.0{\%}) for smell loss, taste loss, and smell or taste loss, respectively, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, there were significantly higher incidences of runny nose/rhinorrhea/rhinitis and nasal congestion/obstruction/blockage in other coronaviruses as compared with SARS-CoV-2 (P {\textless} .001). Understanding these less well-characterized symptoms may help develop measures for estimating early markers of disease prevalence and/or resolution. Level of evidence: 4.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been declared a global pandemic. Identifying individuals whose infection can potentially become severe is critical to control the case fatality rate of COVID-19. However, knowledge of symptoms that are prognostic of COVID-19 severity is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to identify symptoms prognostic of COVID-19 infection severity. METHODS: We analyzed documented symptoms, including fever, cough, fatigue, expectoration, sore throat, chest distress, headache, diarrhea, rhinorrhea, stuffed nose, nausea, vomiting, muscle or joint ache, shortness of breath, and their associations with disease severity using a case series, including 655 confirmed cases from January 23 to February 5, 2020 in Henan Province, China. We also analyzed the influence of individual characteristics, including age, gender, and comorbidities, on symptoms with prognostic value. RESULTS: Fatigue (95{\%} CI 0.141 to 0.334, P{\textless}.001), expectoration (95{\%} CI 0.107 to 0.305, P{\textless}.001) and stuffed nose (95{\%} CI -0.499 to -0.082, P=.006) were identified as the prognostic symptoms of COVID-19 patients from the multivariate analysis. Fever occurred in 603/655 (92.1{\%}) of the patients but was not associated with disease severity. Fatigue accounted for 184/655 (28.1{\%}) of the patients and was linearly associated with infection severity with statistical significance. Expectoration occurred in 169/655 (25.8{\%}) patients in the cohort and was the sole prognostic factor for patients with cardiovascular complications, including hypertension. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough, which occurred in 33 (5{\%}), 83 (12.7{\%}), 78 (11.9{\%}), and 276 (42.1{\%}) of the 655 patients, respectively, were significantly enriched among patients classified as severe. Stuffed nose and nausea were associated with favorable disease severity, especially among male patients. More female than male patients were documented as having muscle or joint ache. Headache was most enriched in patents aged 15 to 39 years, followed by those aged 40 to 64 years, with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and expectoration are signs of severe COVID-19 infection. Shortness of breath, chest distress, muscle or joint ache, and dry cough are prevalent in severe patients. Expectoration is commonly present in older individuals and patients with cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. Shortness of breath is prognostic of severe infection in male patients. Stuffed nose and nausea are favorable prognostic factors of severe infection, especially among male patients.},

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how internet use, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics are associated with engagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from April 10, 2020, to April 14, 2020. Participants' internet use (in terms of the extent of receiving information pertaining to COVID-19), risk awareness (whether any immediate family members, close friends or relatives, or people in local communities tested positive for COVID-19), demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, income, education level, marital status, and employment status), as well as their engagement in preventative behaviors and testing were assessed. RESULTS: Our data included 979 valid responses from the United States. Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.34-1.79, P{\textless}.001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95{\%} CI 1.35-1.85, P{\textless}.001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95{\%} CI 1.52-2.10, P{\textless}.001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95{\%} CI 1.21-1.65, P{\textless}.001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95{\%} CI 1.20-1.62, P{\textless}.001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.32-1.88, P{\textless}.001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95{\%} CI 1.34-1.79, P{\textless}.001). Compared with participants who did not have positive cases in their social circles, those who had immediate family members (OR 1.48, 95{\%} CI 8.28-26.44, P{\textless}.001) or close friends and relatives (OR 2.52, 95{\%} CI 1.58-4.03, P{\textless}.001) who tested positive were more likely to get tested. Participants' sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, and employment status were also associated with preventive behaviors and testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that the extent of receiving COVID-19-related information online, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics including sex, ethnicity, age, marital status, and employment status are key factors associated with US residents' engagement in various preventive behaviors and testing for COVID-19.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-canonical Wnt pathways play important roles in liver fibrosis. Notum is a newly discovered inhibitor to Wnt proteins. This study was to investigate anti-fibrotic effects of Notum. METHODS: 53 patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection as well as a cell co-culture system of LX-2 and Hep AD38 cells were engaged in this study. Clinical, biological and virological data of each patient were analyzed. Cell viability was detected at different time points. mRNA and protein levels of NFATc1 (Nuclear factor of activated T-cells), Jnk, $\alpha$-SMA, Col1A1 and TIMP-1 were detected both in LX-2 and liver tissue. Protein levels of NFATc1 and Jnk in liver tissue and their correlations with fibrosis score were analyzed. RESULTS: Hepatitis B virus replication up-regulated Wnt5a induced NFATc1 and Jnk activity in Hep AD38. Notum suppressed NFATc1, Jnk and fibrosis genes expression, reduced cell viability in co-cultured LX-2 cells induced by HBV. Interestingly, Patients with HBV DNA {\textgreater} 5log copies/ml had higher mRNA levels of NFATc1 and fibrosis genes than patients with HBV DNA {\textless} 5log copies/ml. Most importantly, protein expressions of NFATc1 and pJnk have positive correlations with liver fibrosis scores in HBV-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that Notum inhibited HBV-induced liver fibrosis through down-regulating Wnt 5a mediated non-canonical pathways. This study shed light on anti-fibrotic treatment.},

abstract = {To evaluate immune efficacy of the recombinant Lactobacillus casei, we constructed pLA-Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-F/L. casei and obtained the expression products. PCR amplified the NDV F gene carrying part of the major epitopes. The target gene was inserted to the shuttle plasmid pLA, and then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in order to screen positive recombinant plasmid. The positive recombinant plasmid was transformed into L. casei by electroporation to construct pLA-NDV-F/L. casei. The positive strains were identified by PCR. The reactivity of the recombinant bacteria was identified by Western blotting and the protein expression was detected by indirect immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and laser confocal microscopy. The 14-day-old chickens in each group were vaccinated by oral plus nose drops. The pLA-NDV-F/L. casei twice immunization group and three times immunization group, the commercial vaccine group, the pLA/L. casei group, the unchallenge PBS and the challenge PBS group were established. IgG in serum and sIgA in the lavage fluid of intestinal, nasal and lung were detected by ELISA. The protection rate of chickens was evaluated. The results showed that 94.10{\%} of the recombinant bacteria expressed the F protein. The recombinant protein was highly expressed on the surface of L. casei with a protein size of 62 kDa, which specifically bound to anti-NDV serum. The levels of anti-F IgG and sIgA antibodies in each test group were significantly higher than those in the control groups. The duration of antibody in the pLA-NDV-F/L. casei three-time immunization group lasted 28 days longer than that in the twice immunized group, and there was no significant difference between antibody peak values. The attack protection rates in each group of immunized pLA-NDV-F/L. casei three times, twice, attenuated vaccine, pLA/L. casei and PBS were 80{\%}, 80{\%}, 90{\%}, 0{\%} and 0{\%}, respectively. Therefore, the antigenic protein of NDV F was successfully expressed by L. casei expression system, which has of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and could induce protective immune responses in chickens.},

The roles of the epithelial NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in human rhinovirus (hRV) infection and its effects mediating epithelial functional changes remain poorly understood. Objective: We investigated the mechanisms and cellular functions mediated by the epithelial NLRP3 inflammasome on hRV infection. Methods: Using models of primary human nasal epithelial progenitor cells and differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) infected by hRV, we functionally examined key factors for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, cell death, and mucus production. Furthermore, NLRP3 and IL-1$\beta$ in human epithelium from nasal mucosal inflammation induced by hRV were evaluated. Results: The inflammasome-mediated IL-1$\beta$ secretion and pyroptosis in human nasal epithelial progenitor cells and hNECs on hRV infection were dependent on the DDX33/DDX58–NLRP3–caspase-1–GSDMD axis. In differentiated hNECs hRV could also promote major airway epithelial mucin (MUC5AC) production through this axis. Our results further confirmed that the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway was responsible for suppressing hRV replication in airway epithelium. Finally, hRV infection in chronically inflamed nasal mucosa was associated with epithelial mucus hyperproduction, whereas NLRP3 and IL-1$\beta$ expression levels were significantly increased in hRV-infected epithelium with goblet cell hyperplasia compared with normal epithelium without viral infection. Conclusion: The current study showed that the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis could functionally mediate hRV-induced inflammation, pyroptosis, and mucus production in airway epithelium, which might be an essential mechanism associated with hRV-induced airway remodeling.},

abstract = {The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, and the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). This infection spreads mainly through direct contact with Fl{\"{u}}gge micro droplets or core droplets that remain suspended as aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus. Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that only emergency/urgent procedures should be performed during the coronavirus outbreak. Considering the virus' route of transmission, a specific protocol should be applied to reduce the risk of infection in addition to measures that prevent the spread of infection from a patient to another person or medical tools and equipment (cross-infection). This protocol should be implemented by modifying both patient management and clinical practice, introducing particular devices and organizational practices. This paper aims to discuss and suggest the most appropriate procedures in every aspect of dental practice to reduce infection risk.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical characteristics and radiological findings (chest radiography and chest computed tomography [CT]) of nine children infected with the 2019-nCoV were reviewed in this retrospective case series. RESULTS: Among the children, six had fever (including two children with cough), one had only cough, one had a stuffy nose when initially diagnosed, and one was an asymptomatic carrier. Chest radiographs seemed mostly normal in six cases whereas increased and/or disordered bilateral bronchovascular shadows and dense hilar shadows were seen in three cases. Chest CT exhibited no obvious abnormal signs in four cases. Typical CT findings included patchy, peripheral ground-grass opacities, subpleural lamellar dense shadows, and parenchymal bands. Pleural effusions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cavitation, and pleural thickening were absent. CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations and radiological findings of the 2019-nCoV-infected children were mild and lacked a typical pattern.},

abstract = {Astroviruses (AstV) are associated with enteric and systemic disease in mammals and birds. Astroviruses have received increased attention recently as they have been found to be associated with sporadic neurologic disease in mammals including humans. In pigs, porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) can be widely detected and has been grouped in five genotypes (PoAstV1 to PoAstV5). In the present study, we detected multiple PoAstVs in serum samples, nasal swabs, and fecal swabs collected from pigs suffering from respiratory disease or diarrhea but also from asymptomatic pigs, indicating a wide tissue tropism of the identified PoAstV genotypes. Coinfection of different genotypes in the same pig was commonly observed, and within an individual pig a high genetic diversity was observed for viruses belonging to the same PoAstV genotype. Two complete genomes of PoAstV2-WG-R2/2017 and PoAstV4-WG-R2/2017 were successfully obtained and characterized, with genome sizes of 6396 and 6643 nucleotides, respectively. The PoAstV2-WG-R2/2017 genome showed identities of 67.2–77.4{\%} to other known PoAstV2 genomes, and the PoAstV4-WG-R2/2017 genome showed identities of 72.8–80.5{\%} to other known PoAstV4 genomes. The predicted spike domain of open reading frame 2 (ORF2) of these strains showed the highest genetic heterogeneity, with amino acid identities of 13.7–70.9{\%} for PoAstV2-WG-R2/2017 to other known PoAstV2 strains, and identities of 24.4–63.3{\%} for the PoAstV4-WG-R2/2017 to other known PoAstV4 strains. Possible recombination events were identified in each of the two sequences. Two subclades of PoAstV2 and three subclades of PoAstV4 were defined in the present analyses. The obtained data provide further evidence for extraintestinal infectivity of PoAstVs, and confirmed the high genetic diversity of PoAstVs and the coinfection potential of different PoAstV types in a single pig.},

Methods: Data on 479 male participants within two shelters who completed questionnaires and a total of 950 nasal and pharyngeal samples were collected during the winters of 2015–2017. Respiratory pathogen carriage including seven viruses and four bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR. Results: The homeless population was characterized by a majority of individuals of North African origin (300/479, 62.6{\%}) with a relatively high prevalence of chronic homelessness (175/465, 37.6{\%}). We found a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (168/476, 35.3{\%}), a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage (313/477, 65.6{\%}), especially Haemophilus influenzae (280/477, 58.7{\%}), and a lower prevalence of virus carriage (51/473, 10.8{\%}) with human rhinovirus being the most frequent (25/473, 5.3{\%}). Differences were observed between the microbial communities of the nose and throat. Duration of homelessness (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, p 0.017), chronic respiratory diseases (OR 5.27, p {\textless}0.0001) and visiting countries of origin for migrants (OR 1.68, p 0.035) were identified as independent risk factors for respiratory symptoms and signs. A strong association between virus (OR 2.40, p 0.012) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.32, p 0.014) carriage and respiratory symptoms and signs was also found. Conclusions: These findings allowed identification of the individuals at higher risk for contracting respiratory tract infections to better target preventive measures aimed at limiting the transmission of these diseases in this setting.},

METHODS: This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2141 people (50.8{\%} men; 20-79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020, and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: Three of the five personal protective measures' availability significantly improved during the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4{\%} to 82.2{\%}. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60{\%}). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving; however, there is potential for improvement, especially concerning avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth.},

abstract = {The nasal cavity and turbinates play important physiological functions by filtering, warming and humidifying inhaled air. Paranasal sinuses continually produce nitric oxide (NO), a reactive oxygen species that diffuses to the bronchi and lungs to produce bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effects. Studies indicate that NO may also help to reduce respiratory tract infection by inactivating viruses and inhibiting their replication in epithelial cells. In view of the pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), clinical trials have been designed to examine the effects of inhaled nitric oxide in COVID-19 subjects. We discuss here additional lifestyle factors such as mouth breathing which may affect the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by bypassing the filtering effect of the nose and by decreasing NO levels in the airways. Simple devices that promote nasal breathing during sleep may help prevent the common cold, suggesting potential benefits against coronavirus infection. In the absence of effective treatments against COVID-19, the alternative strategies proposed here should be considered and studied in more detail.},

abstract = {Human rhinovirus infection has been identified as the commonest cause of common cold. We were therefore interested in cytological assessment of nasal cells from patients with human rhinovirus infection. Cytological examination was undertaken of nasal smears from a group of 7 patients, 4 females and 3 males; aged between 27 and 14 years-old (average = 17.5), who had longstanding perennial rhinitis (in all cases 7 years or more). They presented at our research unit showing clinical symptoms of a common cold, including sore throat, nasal congestion, sneezing, and watery rhinorrhea. Serology and DNA real-time PCR demonstrated human rhinoviruses type A (5 cases) and C (two cases) as the cause of the infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were taken, fixed with 96{\%} ethanol and stained using the Papanicolaou method and Giemsa stain. Under light microscopy the Pap smears showed the presence of numerous detached ciliated nasal epithelial cells, with approximately one third of the cells showed destruction and irregular attachment of cilia, microvacuolated cytoplasm, and large red round intranuclear bodies, similar to inclusions, surrounded by clear halos, where the nuclear borders were visible. Ultrastructural examination of the cells indicated disappearance of cilia, or shortened, fragmented and disordered cilia. Large intranuclear bodies appeared as a compact mass similar, similar to the condensed chromatin, and separated from the nuclear membrane by a clear space (Figure 1B). No viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm or nucleus.   Our results confirm that human rhinovirus can alter the morphology of the ciliated nasal epithelial cells, principally causing alterations to the cilia and provoking nuclear changes.},

abstract = {COVID-19 can be divided into three clinical stages, and one can speculate that these stages correlate with where the infection resides. For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose, where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin 5 basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and possible loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.},

abstract = {Equine influenza is a leading cause for respiratory illness in equines. Major control measures involve vaccination which requires continuous harmonization owing to antigenic drift. The present study focused on assessing the protective efficacy of an inactivated recombinant equine influenza virus (rgEIV vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Montanide™Pet Gel in murine model. The rgEIV was generated using reverse genetics by incorporating HA and NA segments from EIV/H3N8, clade 2-Florida sublineage in an A/WSN/33 /H1N1 backbone and inactivated by formalin. The vaccine was prepared by mixing inactivated rgEIV with Montanide™ Pet Gel adjuvant followed by intranasal inoculation into BALB/c mice intranasally. The immune responses and protective efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated by measurement of antibody titer, immunoglobulin subtyping, cytokines, clinical signs and pathological lesions after immunization and challenge with wild EIV. Serology and cytokine expression pattern indicated that the vaccine activated mixed Th1- and Th2-like responses of vaccine. Booster immunization stimulated strong antibody responses (HAI titre: 192 ± 28.6 at 42 days post immunization and the predominant antibody subtype was IgG1. Upregulation of interferon (IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL-12 and IL-2 levels indicates effective induction of Th1 type response. We found that vaccination has protected mice against equine influenza virus challenge as adjudged through a lack of nonappearance of visible clinical signs of disease, no loss of body weight loss, reduced pathology in the lungs and markedly reduced virus shedding from the respiratory tract. Therefore, we conclude that recombinant EIV vaccine candidate adjuvanted with Montanide™ Pet Gel could aid in quick harmonization of the vaccines through replacement of HA and NA genes for control of EIV outbreaks.},

abstract = {Objective: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is preventable through vaccination. This study was motivated by the recent thrust of the Zimbabwean government to reduce incidence of HPV related cervical cancer in Zimbabwe through vaccination against HPV. We therefore set out to type HPV genotypes causing RRP in Zimbabwe. We also describe for the first time, the demographics of Zimbabwean RRP patients, the characteristics of patients with different HPV types and possible risk factors of HPV infection in our setting. Methods: We conducted a prospective, hospital based study were patients were recruited from two national otorhinolaryngology hospitals in Zimbabwe. All patients diagnosed with RRP during a twenty four month period were included in the study. A questionnaire was administered per patient to collect both demographic and clinical variables. HPV DNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded laryngeal tissue. The extracted HPV DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and next generation sequencing was used to genotype the HPV types. Results: A total of 52 patients all aged 14 years and under were recruited into the study. Only Juvenile onset RRP cases were observed over the two year period and 64{\%} of the patients were HPV positive. HPV types 6 and 11 were the dominant types observed constituting 85{\%} of all HPV types. The remaining 15{\%} constituted of HPV 16 and HPV 18. 27{\%} of the patients had coinfection with at least two different HPV types. There were no statistically significant differences between the characteristics of HPV positive and HPV negative patients. No statistically significant risk factors were observed. Conclusion: HPV types 6 and 11 were the predominant genotypes causing RRP in Zimbabwe. Thus the use of quadrivalent or even nonavalent HPV vaccines may play an important role in the prevention and management of RRP in Zimbabwe.},

abstract = {Background: Research has progressed rapidly in recent decades to better understand the etiopathogenesis and management paradigms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Although oral antibiotics often mitigate symptoms in acute CRS exacerbations, eradication of polymicrobial biofilms and multidrug-resistant bacteria remains a challenge. The goal of this review is to summarize and discuss the potential and pitfalls of topical medications in the treatment of CRS. Methods: A related literature review was performed using PubMed and Scopus, with only the English database included. Results: The main therapies were selected and separated in sections. Details regarding future topical treatments of CRS were summarized and discussed. Conclusion: The ease of access of the sinonasal mucosa positions CRS as a disease with high potential for local topical treatment. The ultimate adoption of topical agents will require continued expansion of our understanding of novel local targets in CRS as well as improved methods to deliver and retain the drug of interest at the site of activity.},

abstract = {Human papillomavirus is detected in over 50{\%} of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Human papillomavirus–positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas differ from human papillomavirus–negative tumors, and both expression patterns are classified as distinct entities. The Bmi-1 oncogene is a well-known member of the mammalian polycomb-group family. HESC5:3 and HES77 are newly developed monoclonal antibodies produced against undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. Our aim was to explore their roles in both human papillomavirus–positive and –negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. Our cohort comprised 202 consecutive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients diagnosed and treated with curative intent. We used tissue microarray tumor blocks to study the immunohistochemical expression of Bmi-1, HESC5:3, and HES77. We compared the expressions of these stem cell markers with p16 immunoexpression and human papillomavirus status, as well as with other characteristics of the tumor, and with patients' clinical data and follow-up data. Human papillomavirus– and p16-positive tumors expressed less Bmi-1 and more HESC5:3 than the negative tumors. HES77 expression was high in human papillomavirus–positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, but it did not correlate with p16 positivity. In our multivariable model, Bmi-1 and HESC5:3 were still associated with human papillomavirus, but the association between human papillomavirus and HES77 remained absent. In conclusion, Bmi-1, HESC5:3, and HES77 may have a different role in human papillomavirus–positive and human papillomavirus–negative tumors. There was no correlation between Bmi-1, HESC5:3, and HES77 expression and survival.},

Italian radiology departments found themselves at the forefront in the management of suspected and positive COVID cases, both in diagnosis, in estimating the severity of the disease and in follow-up. In this context SIRM recommends chest X-ray as first-line imaging tool, CT as additional tool that shows typical features of COVID pneumonia, and ultrasound of the lungs as monitoring tool. SIRM recommends, as high priority, to ensure appropriate sanitation procedures on the scan equipment after detecting any suspected or positive COVID-19 patients. In this emergency situation, several expectations have been raised by the scientific community about the role that artificial intelligence can have in improving the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus infection, and SIRM wishes to deliver clear statements to the radiological community, on the usefulness of artificial intelligence as a radiological decision support system in COVID-19 positive patients. (1) SIRM supports the research on the use of artificial intelligence as a predictive and prognostic decision support system, especially in hospitalized patients and those admitted to intensive care, and welcomes single center of multicenter studies for a clinical validation of the test. (2) SIRM does not support the use of CT with artificial intelligence for screening or as first-line test to diagnose COVID-19. (3) Chest CT with artificial intelligence cannot replace molecular diagnosis tests with nose-pharyngeal swab (rRT-PCR) in suspected for COVID-19 patients.},

abstract = {Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is one of the most important causes of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in young children. HRSV diagnosis is based on the detection of the virus in respiratory specimens. Nasopharyngeal swabbing is considered the preferred method of sampling, although there is limited evidence of the superiority of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) over the less invasive nasal (NS) and throat (TS) swabs for virus detection by real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In the current study, we compared the three swabbing methods for the detection of HRSV by RT-qPCR in children hospitalized with ARI at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos. In 2014, NS, NPS, and TS were collected from 288 children. All three samples were tested for HRSV by RT-qPCR; 141 patients were found positive for at least one sample. Almost perfect agreements ($\kappa$ {\textgreater} 0.8) between the swabs, compared two by two, were observed. Detection rates for the three swabs (between 93{\%} and 95{\%}) were not significantly different, regardless of the clinical presentation. Our findings suggest that the uncomfortable and technically more demanding NPS method is not mandatory for HRSV detection by RT-qPCR.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related coagulopathy may be the first clinical manifestation even in non-vasculopathic patients and is often associated with worse clinical outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 78 years old woman was admitted to the Emergency Unit with respiratory symptoms, confusion and cyanosis at the extremity, in particular at the nose area, hands and feet fingers. A nasal swab for COVID-19 was performed, which resulted positive, and so therapy with doxycycline, hydroxychloroquine and antiviral agents was started. At admission, the patient was hemodynamically unstable requiring circulatory support with liquids and norepinephrine; laboratory tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). During hospitalization, the clinical condition worsened and the cyanosis of the nose, fingers, and toes rapidly increased and became dried gangrene in three days. Subsequently, the neurological state deteriorated into a coma and the patient died. DISCUSSION: In severe cases, COVID-19 could be complicated by acute respiratory disease syndrome, septic shock, and multi-organ failure. This case report shows the quick development of dried gangrene in a non-vasculopathic patient, as a consequence of COVID-19's coagulopathy and DIC. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient, COVID-19 related coagulopathy was associated with poor prognosis.},

abstract = {The world is currently facing an unprecedented healthcare crisis caused by a pandemic novel beta coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogen is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets exposure and contact transfer, causing mild symptoms in the majority of cases, but critical illness, bilateral viral pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a minority. Currently, controlling infection to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary public healthcare intervention used. The pace of transmission and global scale of SARS-CoV-2 infections has implications for strategic oversight, resource management, and responsiveness in infection control. This article presents a summary of learning points in epidemiological infection control from the SARS epidemic, alongside a review of evidence connecting current understanding of the virologic and environmental contamination properties of SARS-CoV-2. We present suggestions for how personal protective equipment policies relate to the viral pandemic context and how the risk of transmission by and to anaesthetists, intensivists, and other healthcare workers can be minimised.},

BVDV has been detected among goats in the Republic of Korea, but the route of transmission remains unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate whether BVDV-1b circulating among Korean cattle can be transmitted to Korean native goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and characterize the outcomes of BVDV infection in these goats. Results: Four goats were inoculated intranasally with the Korean noncytopathic (ncp) BVDV-1b strain. Two goats exhibited clinical signs of illness, including coughing and nasal discharge. Nasal swabs and blood were collected to screen for viral RNA and BVDV antibodies. Using the 5′-untranslated region (UTR), viral RNA was detected in the nasal swabs of two goats (Goat 1 and 3) on 12 day post-inoculation (dpi) and in the blood sample of one goat (Goat 1) on 7 and 19 dpi. Using the N-terminal protease (Npro) region, viral RNA was detected in the blood sample of Goat 1 on 7 and 12 dpi. Antibodies to BVDV were detected in Goats 1 and 3 on 16-21 dpi using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sequence analysis of the virus from nasal swabs and blood samples, which was detected via RT-PCR, using the 5′-UTR and Npro regions led to the identification of the strain as ncp BVDV-1b and revealed changes in the nucleotide sequence of these goats. Conclusions: Our results indicate that changes in the nucleotide sequence are associated with the establishment of BVDV infection in Korean native goats; these changes may be owing to a process required for the establishment of infection in a new host reservoir. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of BVDV surveillance in ungulates other than cattle.},

abstract = {Because of the pandemic of COVID-19, the federal government of Nigeria has instituted a mandatory policy requiring everyone going out in public to wear face masks. Unfortunately, the Nigeria media is awash with images of misuse and abuse of face masks by the public, government officials, and healthcare workers. Medical masks are used widely in community settings amid reported scarcity within healthcare facilities. It is observed that some people wear face masks on their chin and neck, and mask wearers give no attention to covering their mouth and nose, especially when talking. Used face masks are kept with personal belongings or disposed indiscriminately in public spaces, leading to self and environmental contamination. Inappropriate use and disposal of face masks in Nigeria could promote the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country and negate the country's efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. In the implementation of the universal masking policy in Nigeria, federal and state governments ought to consider local applicability, feasibility, and sustainability, as well as identify and mitigate all potential risks and unintended consequences. Also critical is the need for intensive public sensitization and education on appropriate use and disposal of face masks in the country.},

abstract = {Pandemics such as influenza, smallpox, and plague have caused the loss of hundreds of millions of lives and have occurred for many centuries. Fortunately, they have been largely eliminated by the use of vaccinations and drugs. More recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and now Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have arisen, and given the current absence of highly effective approved vaccines or drugs, brute-force approaches involving physical barriers are being used to counter virus spread. A major basis for physical protection from respiratory infections is eye, nose, and mouth protection. However, eye protection with goggles is problematic due to "fogging", while nose/mouth protection is complicated by the breathing difficulties associated with non-valved respirators. Here, we give a brief review of the origins and development of face masks and eye protection to counter respiratory infections on the basis of experiments conducted 100 years ago, work that was presaged by the first use of personal protective equipment, "PPE", by the plague doctors of the 17(th) Century. The results of the review lead to two conclusions: first, that eye protection using filtered eye masks be used to prevent ocular transmission; second, that new, pre-filtered, valved respirators be used to even more effectively block viral transmission.},

abstract = {Background: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a chronic disease of viral origin affecting the larynx, trachea, and lower airways. Inverted papilloma, most commonly originating from the lateral nasal wall, is typically a single, expansile, locally aggressive tumor that remodels bone around the site of origin. Case presentation: We report a case of histopathologically proven inverted papilloma occurring in a 50-year-old Caucasian man with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis affecting his nasal cavity, larynx, and trachea. This constitutes the first report of nasal involvement in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Viral in situ hybridization studies demonstrated evidence of human papillomavirus in both the septum and middle turbinate subsites. Repeat nasal excision with margin analysis is planned. Conclusions: This report emphasizes the importance of considering a broad differential diagnosis in patients with papillomata, and obtaining comprehensive histopathologic evaluation of lesions in multiple subsites in order to rule out inverted papilloma or overt malignant transformation, particularly if high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes are identified.

Nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs were collected from participants who reported acute respiratory illness (ARI) defined as fever, cough or running nose. Nasal swabs and blood samples were collected from pigs. Human NP/OP and pig nasal swabs were tested for influenza A virus by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and pig serum was tested for anti-influenza A antibodies by ELISA. Results: A total of 288 participants were sampled, 91.3{\%} of them being male. Fifteen (5.2{\%}) participants had ARI but the nine swabs collected from them were negative for influenza A virus by PCR. Of the 1128 pigs sampled, five (0.4{\%}) nasal swabs tested positive for influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 by PCR whereas 214 of 1082 (19.8{\%}) serum samples tested for Influenza A virus antibodies. There was higher seroprevalence in colder months and among pigs reared as free-range. These findings indicate circulation of influenza A/H1N1/pdm09 among pigs perhaps associated with good adaptation of the virus to the pig population after initial transmission from humans to pigs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pandemic calls for a rapid adaptation of conventional medical practices to meet the evolving needs of such vulnerable patients. People with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may frequently require treatment with psychotropic medications, but are at the same time at higher risk for safety issues because of the complex underlying medical condition and the potential interaction with medical treatments. METHODS: In order to produce evidence-based practical recommendations on the optimal management of psychotropic medications in people with COVID-19, an international, multi-disciplinary working group was established. The methodology of the WHO Rapid Advice Guidelines in the context of a public health emergency and the principles of the AGREE statement were followed. Available evidence informing on the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular, infective, hemostatic, and consciousness alterations related to the use of psychotropic medications, and drug-drug interactions between psychotropic and medical treatments used in people with COVID-19, was reviewed and discussed by the working group. RESULTS: All classes of psychotropic medications showed potentially relevant safety risks for people with COVID-19. A set of practical recommendations was drawn in order to inform frontline clinicians on the assessment of the anticipated risk of psychotropic-related unfavorable events, and the possible actions to take in order to effectively manage this risk, such as when it is appropriate to avoid, withdraw, switch, or adjust the dose of the medication. CONCLUSIONS: The present evidence-based recommendations will improve the quality of psychiatric care in people with COVID-19, allowing an appropriate management of the medical condition without worsening the psychiatric condition and vice versa.},

This study sought to understand the distribution pattern of HRV subgroups, their seasonality and association with respiratory complications in patients at a tertiary care hospital. Results: Of the total 332 ARTI samples, 82 (24.7{\%}) were positive for ENV/HRV. Twenty positive samples were processed further for phylogenetic analysis. Ten of the 20 samples were identified to be HRVs (70{\%} HRV A and 30{\%} HRV C) and nine were enteroviruses. HRV A clustered near three distinct HRV types (A12, A78 and A82). Four of the HRV strains (represented as SEQ 137 rhino, SEQ 282 rhino, SEQ 120 rhino and SEQ 82 rhino) had high sequence similarity. HRV C showed seasonality and was associated with disease severity. Conclusion: The genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of the HRVs in the current study shows its circulatory pattern, association with risk factors and evolutionary dynamics.},

To support the eradication programme we have quantified the levels of PPR virus (PPRV) nucleic acid excreted in body fluids (blood, feces, saliva, nasal and eye swabs) of PPRV-infected goats to ascertain which days post-infection animals are potentially infectious, and hence direct quarantine activities. The data will also indicate optimal sample strategies to assess presence of PPR infection in the naturally infected herd. Peak PPRV nucleic acid detection in different bodily fluids was between 5 and 10 days post-infection. As such, this period must be considered the most infectious period for contact transmission, although high viral load was observed through RNA detection in nasal excretions from two days post-infection until at least two weeks post-infection. Percentage sample positivity was low both in eye swabs and saliva samples during the early stage of infection although RNA was detected as late as two weeks post-infection. From the individual animal data, PPRV was detected later post-infection in fecal material than in other body fluids and the detection was intermittent. The results from this study indicate that nasal swabs are the most appropriate to sample when considering molecular diagnosis of PPRV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although Pasteurella multocida is highly prevalent pathogen in animals and plays an important role in swine respiratory diseases, only a few studies on the use of bacteriophages specific to Pasteurella multocida disease have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The object of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of specific P. multocida bacteriophages and to identify genes related to bacteriophage signaling utilizing RNA microarrays in swine nasal turbinate cells. METHODS: Pas-MUP-1 phages were applied 24 h prior to P. multocida infection (1 × 10(7) cfu/ml) at several concentrations of bacterial infection. Cells were incubated to detect cytokines and 24 h to detect mucin production. And real-time quantitative PCR was performed to examine related genes expression. To determine the change of total gene expression based on P. multocida and Pas-MUP-1 treatment, we performed RNA sequencing experiments. RESULTS: We found that P. multocida-infected PT-K75 cells show increased gene expression of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and Muc1 in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, these genes resulted in decreased expression in P. multocida pretreated with the P. multocida-specific Pas-MUP-1 bacteriophage. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that bacteriophage administration regulated genes associated with immune and inflammatory responses, and the regulated genes were dramatically concentrated in the cytokine/chemokine-based signaling pathways. Pas-MUP-1 treatment was shown to regulate P. multocida induced gene expression in the bacteria. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the specific bacteriophage has therapeutic potential as an alternative to antibiotic treatment to defend against P. multocida infection by altering inflammatory gene expression profiles.},

@article{Parvathaneni2019,
abstract = {During the past decade and a half, the most common cause of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has shifted from tobacco and alcohol to the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPVdriven p16-positive OPSCC and tobacco-related OPSCC differ in their underlying molecular and genetic profiles, socioeconomic demographics, and response to treatment. HPV-related OPSCC tends to occur in younger patients and has a significantly better response to treatment and excellent prognosis. The stark contrast in prognosis— with around 90{\%} overall 5-year survival for HPV-related p16-positive OPSCC and 40{\%} for non–HPV-related p16-negative OPSCC—has prompted major changes in the eighth edition of the staging manual of the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer). The past 10–15 years have also witnessed major advances in surgery, radiation therapy (RT), and systemic therapy. Minimally invasive surgery has come of age, with transoral robotic procedures and laser microsurgery. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and more recently proton-beam RT have markedly improved the conformity of RT, with an ability to precisely target the cancer and cancer-bearing regions while sparing normal structures and significantly reducing long-term treatment-related morbidity. Progress in systemic therapy has come in the form of immunotherapy and targeted agents such as cetuximab. Owing to the better prognosis of HPV-driven OPSCC as well as the morbidity associated with treatment, de-escalation of therapy via multiple strategies is being explored. The article reviews the advances in diagnosis and multidisciplinary management of OPSCC in the HPV era.},

Italian Northern regions are among the most badly affected areas. Surfaces represent matrices to which particular attention should be paid for prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. A few studies have highlighted virus presence on surfaces. We report the evidence of its presence on hospital surfaces, in a single room hosting a patient whose nose-pharyngeal swab resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the admission. The surfaces sampling was carried out using pre-wetted swabs followed by extraction and amplification of viral RNA by reverse Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR). A total of 4/15 (26.66{\%}) surfaces were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA: the right bed rail, the call button, the bed trapeze bar, the stethoscope; moreover, the patient's inner surgical mask was positive, showing the emission of the virus from the patient. This study is a further confirmation that the surfaces represent a potential vehicle of transmission. This supports the need for strict adherence to hand and environmental hygiene.},

We demonstrated previously that an ORF1/ORF71 gene deletion mutant of the EHV-1 strain Ab4 (Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71) is less virulent than its parent Ab4 virus. Here, we describe the Ab4 challenge infection evaluating protection induced by the Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 vaccine candidate. Susceptible control horses developed respiratory disease, fever, nasal shedding, and viremia. Full protection after challenge infection was observed in 5/5 previously Ab4 infected horses and 3/5 Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 horses. Two Ab4$\Delta$ORF1/71 horses developed short-lasting viremia and/or virus shedding. Protective immunity in the respiratory tract was characterized by pre-existing EHV-1-specific IgG4/7 antibodies, the absence of IFN-$\alpha$ secretion and rapidly increasing IgG4/7 upon challenge infection. Pre-existing systemic EHV-1-specific IgG4/7 highly correlated with protection. T-cell immunity was overall low. In conclusion, protective immunity against EHV-1 infection including prevention of viremia was associated with robust systemic and intranasal IgG4/7 antibodies suggesting immediate virus neutralization at the local site.},

abstract = {Performing a proper nasal and oropharyngeal swab procedure is essential in the screening of COVID-19 infection. The video illustration of nasal and oropharyngeal swab is presented (Video S1). To correctly perform the nasopharyngeal swab, the patient must be seated comfortably with the back of their head against the headrest. The swab is inserted in the nose horizontally, along an imaginary line between the nostril and the ear. Oropharyngeal sampling is easier to perform. The swab is directed toward the rear wall of the oropharynx and it is rotated a few times before removal. After taking the sample, it is necessary to insert both swabs in the same tube, breaking the rod with one swift and controlled movement. Finally, carefully reset the cap. It appears to be extremely important to properly collect nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in order to minimize the false negative rate among COVID-19 positive patients.},

@article{Pfeifer2020,
abstract = {Against the background of the pandemic caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2, the German Society for Pneumology and Respiratory Medicine (DGP e.V.), in cooperation with other associations, has designated a team of experts in order to answer the currently pressing questions about therapy strategies in dealing with COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI).The position paper is based on the current knowledge that is evolving daily. Many of the published and cited studies require further review, also because many of them did not undergo standard review processes.Therefore, this position paper is also subject to a continuous review process and will be further developed in cooperation with the other professional societies.This position paper is structured into the following five topics:1. Pathophysiology of acute respiratory insufficiency in patients without immunity infected with SARS-CoV-22. Temporal course and prognosis of acute respiratory insufficiency during the course of the disease3. Oxygen insufflation, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive ventilation with special consideration of infectious aerosol formation4. Non-invasive ventilation in ARI5. Supply continuum for the treatment of ARIKey points have been highlighted as core statements and significant observations. Regarding the pathophysiological aspects of acute respiratory insufficiency (ARI), the pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 runs through three phases: early infection, pulmonary manifestation and severe hyperinflammatory phase.There are differences between advanced COVID-19-induced lung damage and those changes seen in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndromes (ARDS) as defined by the Berlin criteria. In a pathophysiologically plausible - but currently not yet histopathologically substantiated - model, two types (L-type and H-type) are distinguished, which correspond to an early and late phase. This distinction can be taken into consideration in the differential instrumentation in the therapy of ARI.The assessment of the extent of ARI should be carried out by an arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions and must include the calculation of the oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, the Hb value, the corrected values of the H{\"{u}}fner number and the cardiac output). In principle, aerosols can cause transmission of infectious viral particles. Open systems or leakage systems (so-called vented masks) can prevent the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened, and endotracheal intubation must be carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection.The protection of personnel with personal protective equipment should have very high priority because fear of contagion must not be a primary reason for intubation. If the specifications for protective equipment (eye protection, FFP2 or FFP-3 mask, gown) are adhered to, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow (NHF) therapy, CPAP therapy or NIV can be carried out according to the current state of knowledge without increased risk of infection to the staff. A significant proportion of patients with respiratory failure presents with relevant hypoxemia, often also caused by a high inspiratory oxygen fraction (FiO2) including NHF, and this hypoxemia cannot be not completely corrected. In this situation, CPAP/NIV therapy can be administered under use of a mouth and nose mask or a respiratory helmet as therapy escalation, as long as the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not fulfilled.In acute hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, NIV should be performed in an intensive care unit or in a comparable unit by personnel with appropriate expertise. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring with readiness to carry out intubation must be ensured at all times. If CPAP/NIV leads to further progression of ARI, intubation and subsequent invasive ventilation should be carried out without delay if no DNI order is in place.In the case of patients in whom invasive ventilation, after exhausting all guideline-based measures, is not sufficient, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation procedure (ECMO) should be considered to ensure sufficient oxygen supply and to remove CO(2).},

We conducted a serological survey using a novel approach to rule out cross-reactive antibodies to other seasonal influenza viruses to determine whether additional A(H7N2) human infections had occurred and to assess exposure risk. Results. Of 121 shelter workers, one had serological evidence of A(H7N2) infection, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 0.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, .02{\%}-4.5{\%}). Five persons exhibited low positive titers to A(H7N2) virus, indicating possible infection; however, we could not exclude cross-reactive antibody responses to seasonal influenza viruses. The remaining 115 persons were seronegative. The seropositive person reported multiple direct cat exposures without using personal protective equipment and mild illness with subjective fever, runny nose, and sore throat. Conclusions. We identified a second case of A(H7N2) infection from this outbreak, providing further evidence of cat-to-human transmission of A(H7N2) virus.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by a large number of viral and bacterial agents. PARV4 is a recently identified virus detected in human blood and variety of tissues, but its disease association with SARI could not be established. OBJECTIVE: In the present case control study, we aim to investigate the association of PARV4 with SARI. METHODS: The Nasal and Throat swab (NS/TS) samples of 241 cases and 146 healthy controls were tested for most common respiratory viruses and PARV4 by real-time PCR. RESULTS: PARV4 was detected in 64(26.55{\%}) SARI cases and only one healthy control (0.68{\%}). PARV4 was the most common viral agent detected in SARI cases. A strong association of PARV4 is seen with severe respiratory illness. CONCLUSION: Detection of PARV4 in a significantly higher number of SARI cases, in comparison with controls, suggests association of PARV4 with SARI. PARV4 genotype 2 is the only circulating strain detected in our study.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The sudden onset of smell and taste loss has been reported as a symptom related to COVID-19. There is urgent need to provide insight to the pandemic and evaluate anosmia as a potential screening symptom that might contribute to the decision to test suspected cases or guide quarantine instructions. METHODS: Systematic review of the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane databases and preprints up to May 3, 2020. Combined search terms included: "COVID-19", "SARS-CoV-2", "coronavirus", "nose", "anosmia", "hyposmia", "olfactory loss", "smell loss", "taste loss", and "hypogeusia". RESULTS: Our search identified 18 reviewed articles and 6 manuscript preprints, including a large epidemiological study, four observational case series, five case-controlled studies, five cross-sectional studies, five case series of anosmic patients and four electronic surveys. Great methodological differences were noted. A significant prevalence of anosmia is reported in COVID-19 patients. Controlled studies indicate that anosmia is more common in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other viral infections or controls. Most of the studies reported either smell loss or smell plus taste loss. Less severe COVID-19 disease is related to a greater prevalence of anosmia. A quick recovery of the smell loss may be expected in most COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: Anosmia is more prevalent in COVID-19 patients than in patients suffering from other respiratory infections or controls.},

abstract = {Context Due to the inconsistent development of enteric signs associated with ECoV infection in adult horses, many practitioners collect nasal secretions rather than feces for the molecular diagnostic work-up of such horses. Main conclusion ECoV infection should be considered in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, especially when nasal discharge is absent as one of the cardinal clinical sign. Approach A total of 277 adult horses with acute onset of fever were enrolled in this study. Feces were tested for ECoV and nasal secretions for common respiratory pathogens (equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1, EHV-4, equine influenza virus (EIV), equine rhinitis viruses (ERVs) and Streptococcus equi ss. equi) and ECoV by qPCR. Each submission was accompanied by a questionnaire requesting information pertaining to signalment, use, recent transportation, number of affected horses on the premise and presence of clinical signs at the time of sample collection. Results The total number of horses testing qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces was 20 (7.2{\%}), 4 of which also tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in nasal secretions. In the same population 9.0{\%} of horses tested qPCR-positive for EHV-4, 6.1{\%} for EIV, 4.3{\%} for Streptococcus equi ss. equi, 3.2{\%} for ERVs and 0.7{\%} for EHV-1. Draft horses, pleasure use, multiple horses affected on a premise and lack of nasal discharge were significantly associated with ECoV qPCR-positive horses. Interpretation The present study results showed that 7.2{\%} of horses with acute onset of fever tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces, highlighting the importance of testing such horses for ECoV in feces. The various prevalence factors associated with ECoV qPCR-positive status likely relate to the high infectious nature of ECoV and breed-specific differences in management and husbandry practices. Significance of findings ECoV infection should be suspected and tested for in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, lethargy and anorexia with no respiratory signs. A two-step approach should be consider in which respiratory secretions and feces should be collected from such horses and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. If the respiratory secretions test negative by qPCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens, feces already submitted to the laboratory should be tested for ECoV.},

@article{Quirouette2020,
abstract = {Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell's beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 $\mu$m/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is limited data on the analytical performance of commercial nucleic acid tests (NATs) for laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal, combined nose and throat swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and sputum was collected from persons with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 viral cultures and synthetic positive controls (gBlocks, Integrated DNA Technologies) were tested using i) AusDiagnostics assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd); ii) in-house developed assays targeting the E and RdRp genes; iii) multiplex PCR assay targeting endemic respiratory viruses. Discrepant SARS-CoV-2 results were resolved by testing the N, ORF1b, ORF1ab and M genes. RESULTS: Of 52 clinical samples collected from 50 persons tested, respiratory viruses were detected in 22 samples (42 {\%}), including SARS CoV-2 (n = 5), rhinovirus (n = 7), enterovirus (n = 5), influenza B (n = 4), hMPV (n = 5), influenza A (n = 2), PIV-2 (n = 1), RSV (n = 2), CoV-NL63 (n = 1) and CoV-229E (n = 1). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in four additional samples by the AusDiagnostics assay. Using the in-house assays as the "gold standard", the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the AusDiagnostics assay was 100 {\%}, 92.16 {\%}, 55.56 {\%} and 100 {\%} respectively. The Ct values of the real-time in-house-developed PCR assay targeting the E gene was significantly lower than the corresponding RdRp gene assay when applied to clinical samples, viral culture and positive controls (mean 21.75 vs 28.1, p = 0.0031). CONCLUSIONS: The AusDiagnostics assay is not specific for the detection SARS-CoV-2. Any positive results should be confirmed using another NAT or sequencing. The case definition used to investigate persons with suspected COVID-19 infection is not specific.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Researchers across the world are emphasising the importance of hand-washing and limited touching of face to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, access to safe water and hygiene is inadequate in many places around the globe; hence T-zone touching restriction is considered more worthwhile compared to other prevention strategies. AIM: A systematic review was carried out to appraise the frequency of T-zone (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) touching in humans to comprehend the challenge of its restriction, and thus support public health professionals to produce evidence synthesis guidance for public.For this systemic review, data were collected by keyword searching, and several online databases were searched. The PRISMA checklist, PECO protocol and STROBE guideline were followed in this review, and pooled data were analysed in R version 4. RESULT: Total of 10 single arms observational studies were included. The pooled average (SD) facial self-touch per hour was 50.06 (±47) times, and a specific touch of T-zone was 68.7 (±27). T-zone self-touch within the total facial self-touch was found higher R = 0.680, with 95{\%} CI 0.14, 0.91, P = 0.02 and X(2) = 167.63, P {\textless} 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The review found that face-touch is a type of consistent regulatory movements. Control of T-zone touch requires extensive behaviour intervention and community awareness.},

abstract = {Background: Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children in low and middle-income countries. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is one of the most common viral etiological agents for ARIs in children. Objectives: In this study, we explored the genotypic diversity and the epidemiology of hMPV among infants in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Study Design: Between December 2014 and August 2016, a total of 3810 mid-turbinate nasal swab samples were collected from infants (0 to 6 months of age) who met clinical ARI criteria, as a part of a prospective ARI cohort study. hMPV was detected using polymerase chain reaction, and genotyped by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results: hMPV was identified in 206 (5.4{\%}) nasal swab specimens. One-tenth of the hMPV-positive swabs (n = 19) were also positive for other respiratory viruses. hMPV activity peaked in January and September in 2015; however, no seasonal pattern of hMPV infection was detected. Phylogenetic analyses of the N and F gene-fragments revealed that the hMPV strains circulating in Dhaka, Bangladesh, belonged to three genotypes: A2b, A2c, and B1. Genotype A (57{\%}) was the predominant hMPV genotype circulating in Bangladesh during the study period. Conclusion: This study describes both the epidemiology of hMPV infection and its genotypic strain diversity in Dhaka, Bangladesh.},

abstract = {Cell-free microRNA (miRNA) in biofluids released by tumors in either protein or vesicle-bound form, represent promising minimally-invasive cancer biomarkers. However, a highly abundant non-tumor background in human plasma and serum complicates the discovery and detection of tumor-selective circulating miRNAs. We performed small RNA sequencing on serum and plasma RNA from Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) patients. Collectively, Epstein Barr virus-encoded miRNAs, more so than endogenous miRNAs, signify presence of NPC. However, RNAseq-based EBV miRNA profiles differ between NPC patients, suggesting inter-tumor heterogeneity or divergent secretory characteristics. We determined with sensitive qRT-PCR assays that EBV miRNAs BART7-3p, BART9-3p and BART13-3p are actively secreted by C666.1 NPC cells bound to extracellular vesicles (EVs) and soluble ribonucleoprotein complexes. Importantly, these miRNAs are expressed in all primary NPC tumor biopsies and readily detected in nasopharyngeal brushings from both early and late-stage NPC patients. Increased levels of BART7-3p, BART9-3p and particularly BART13-3p, distinguish NPC patient sera from healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis using sera from endemic NPC patients, other head and neck cancers and individuals with asymptomatic EBV-infections reveals a superior diagnostic performance of EBV miRNAs over anti-EBNA1 IgA serology and EBV-DNA load (AUC 0.87–0.96 vs 0.86 and 0.66 respectively). The high specificity of circulating EBV-BART13-3p (97{\%}) for NPC detection is in agreement with active secretion from NPC tumor cells. We conclude EV-bound BART13-3p in circulation is a promising, NPC-selective, biomarker that should be considered as part of a screening strategy to identify NPC in endemic regions.},

We aimed to compare different HPV-detection methods against the test used in clinical practice, ie, p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and to evaluate whether another HPV-detection test additional to p16 IHC would be worthwhile in OPSCC specimens. The study cohort comprised 357 consecutive OPSCC patients during two time periods: 2000-2009 and 2012-2016. From tumor tissue slides, HPV mRNA via in situ hybridization (ISH), HPV DNA via ISH and HPV DNA via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were detected. The results of these methods were compared with p16 IHC results. Additionally, clinicopathological factors were compared with the methods studied. The sensitivity of HPV mRNA ISH, HPV DNA ISH and HPV DNA PCR were 93.4{\%}, 86.3{\%}, and 83.5{\%}, respectively. The corresponding specificity was 92.4{\%}, 95.3{\%}, and 89.1{\%}, respectively. The negative predictive value for p16 IHC was highest (89.0{\%}) when using mRNA ISH, and followed by DNA ISH (83.5{\%}). ISH for high-risk HPV E6/E7 mRNA was found to be a highly specific and sensitive method for detecting HPV in OPSCC. As p16 protein may be overexpressed due to HPV-independent mechanisms, all p16 IHC–positive OPSCCs should be considered for retesting using mRNA ISH in order to verify transcriptionally active HPV. This is especially critical when considering de-escalated treatment approaches for patients with HPV-positive tumors and still maintaining favorable outcomes for this subgroup of patients.},

It can be the initial symptom of the disease or remain isolated in pauci-symptomatic patients. Waiting for scientific confirmation and in the context of the current pandemic, it seems essential to consider any patient with a new anosmia as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 until proven otherwise. These patients should therefore isolate themselves and remain alert to the occurrence of other symptoms suggestive of the infection and/or be tested. Topical and systemic corticosteroids and nose washes are contraindicated. The natural course of anosmia seems to be favorable in most cases.},

In MEDLINE, Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process {\&} Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, Cochrane library and Web of Science searches, observational studies and clinical trials that reported survival rates of patients with SCCUPHN by HPV status were identified. Meta-analysis estimated the prevalence and prognosis (overall survival, OS; progression-free survival, PFS) of SCCUPHN by HPV status, and compared them to studies of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) from the same institutions and across continents. In 17 SCCUPHN studies (n = 1,149) and 17 institution-matched OPSCC studies (n = 6,522), the pooled HPV prevalence of SCCUPHN was 49{\%}, which was only 10{\%} (95{\%}CI: 1–19{\%}) lower than OPSCC prevalence in the underlying population. Estimated 5-year OS for HPV-negative SCCUPHN was 44{\%} (95{\%}CI: 36–51{\%}) vs. HPV-positive SCCUPHN of 91{\%} (95{\%}CI: 86–96{\%}); hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 3.25 (95{\%}CI: 2.45–4.31) and PFS was 4.49 (95{\%}CI: 2.88–7.02). HRs by HPV status for OPSCC were similar to that in SCCUPHN. While North American SCCUPHNs had higher HPV prevalence than European SCCUPHNs (OR = 2.68 (95{\%}CI: 1.3–5.6)), HR of OS for HPV-negative vs. HPV-positive patients were similar in both continents (HRs of 3.78–4.09). Prevalence of HPV among SCCUPHN patients were lower than in OPSCC. The survival benefit conferred by being HPV-positive was similar in SCCUPHN as in OPSCCs, independent of continent.},

abstract = {Human influenza A viruses are known to be transmitted via the air from person to person. It is unknown from which anatomical site of the respiratory tract influenza A virus transmission occurs. Here, pairs of genetically tagged and untagged influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 viruses that are transmissible via the air are used to co-infect donor ferrets via the intranasal and intratracheal routes to cause an upper and lower respiratory tract infection, respectively. In all transmission cases, we observe that the viruses in the recipient ferrets are of the same genotype as the viruses inoculated intranasally, demonstrating that they are expelled from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets rather than from trachea or the lower airways. Moreover, influenza A viruses that are transmissible via the air preferentially infect ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium. These results indicate that virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, the nasal respiratory epithelium in particular, of donors is a driver for transmission of influenza A viruses via the air.},

@article{Rivett2020,
abstract = {Significant differences exist in the availability of healthcare worker (HCW) SARS-CoV-2 testing between countries, and existing programmes focus on screening symptomatic rather than asymptomatic staff. Over a 3 week period (April 2020), 1032 asymptomatic HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in a large UK teaching hospital. Symptomatic staff and symptomatic household contacts were additionally tested. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3{\%} of HCWs in the asymptomatic screening group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57{\%}) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40{\%}) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19){\textgreater}7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well. Clusters of HCW infection were discovered on two independent wards. Viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the dominant lineage B∙1. Our data demonstrates the utility of comprehensive screening of HCWs with minimal or no symptoms. This approach will be critical for protecting patients and hospital staff. Patients admitted to NHS hospitals are now routinely screened for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), and isolated from other patients if necessary. Yet healthcare workers, including frontline patient-facing staff such as doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, are only tested and excluded from work if they develop symptoms of the illness. However, there is emerging evidence that many people infected with SARS-CoV-2 never develop significant symptoms: these people will therefore be missed by ‘symptomatic-only' testing. There is also important data showing that around half of all transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 happen before the infected individual even develops symptoms. This means that much broader testing programs are required to spot people when they are most infectious. Rivett, Sridhar, Sparkes, Routledge et al. set out to determine what proportion of healthcare workers was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while also feeling generally healthy at the time of testing. Over 1,000 staff members at a large UK hospital who felt they were well enough to work, and did not fit the government criteria for COVID-19 infection, were tested. Amongst these, 3{\%} were positive for SARS-CoV-2. On closer questioning, around one in five reported no symptoms, two in five very mild symptoms that they had dismissed as inconsequential, and a further two in five reported COVID-19 symptoms that had stopped more than a week previously. In parallel, healthcare workers with symptoms of COVID-19 (and their household contacts) who were self-isolating were also tested, in order to allow those without the virus to quickly return to work and bolster a stretched workforce. Finally, the rates of infection were examined to probe how the virus could have spread through the hospital and among staff – and in particular, to understand whether rates of infection were greater among staff working in areas devoted to COVID-19 patients. Despite wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, healthcare workers in these areas were almost three times more likely to test positive than those working in areas without COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear whether this genuinely reflects greater rates of patients passing the infection to staff. Staff may give the virus to each other, or even acquire it at home. Overall, this work implies that hospitals need to be vigilant and introduce broad screening programmes across their workforces. It will be vital to establish such approaches before ‘lockdown' is fully lifted, so healthcare institutions are prepared for any second peak of infections. eng},

To compare its pathogenesis with that of previously emerging coronaviruses, we inoculated cynomolgus macaques with SARS-CoV-2 or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV and compared the pathology and virology with historical reports of SARS-CoV infections. In SARS-CoV-2-infected macaques, virus was excreted from nose and throat in the absence of clinical signs and detected in type I and II pneumocytes in foci of diffuse alveolar damage and in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal, bronchial, and bronchiolar mucosae. In SARS-CoV infection, lung lesions were typically more severe, whereas they were milder in MERS-CoV infection, where virus was detected mainly in type II pneumocytes. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19-like disease in macaques and provides a new model to test preventive and therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Rhinovirus is a common picornavirus with over 150 serotypes and three species, which is responsible for half of the human common cold cases. In people with chronic respiratory conditions and elders, it may also cause life-threatening diseases. Transmission routes are not definitively established but may involve direct human-to-human and indirect transmission (surfaces and aerosols based). In the present study, year-long presence of virus was tested by qPCR in the nostrils of young healthy volunteers and indoor and outdoor air samples. Results were correlated to atmospheric conditions (meteorological and air quality parameters) and voluntaries immune system-related genetic polymorphisms (TOLLIP rs5743899, IL6 rs1800795, IL1B rs16944, TNFA rs1800629) typed by PCR–RFLP. Nasal samples showed increased frequency and viral titers of Rhinovirus in spring and autumn. No indoor air samples tested positive for Rhinovirus, whereas outdoor air samples tested positive in late autumn. Sun radiation, atmospheric SO2, and benzene levels correlated with nostrils Rhinovirus detection. Both IL6 and TOLLIP polymorphisms but not TNFA or IL1B influenced Rhinovirus detection in the nostrils of voluntaries. Taken together, the results indicate that Rhinovirus circulation is determined by environmental conditions (weather, air-borne virus, and air pollution) and genetically encoded individual variation in immunity.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare mucosal flora in HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects, to assess chemosusceptibility patterns of carriage isolates and to evaluate possible predisposing factors within the two groups. Methods: We analyzed microbes isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs in virologically suppressed and immunologically stable HIV-positive adult outpatients (n=105) at baseline and after 12 months and in an age-matched cohort of HIV-negative outpatients (n=100) at baseline. Bacteria and Candida spp strains were isolated and identified through standard biochemical assays and chemosusceptibility tests were performed. Multi Locus Sequence Typing was also determined to characterize Staphylococcus aureus isolates from HIV-infected persistent carriers. Results: In HIV-positive patients a significantly higher rate of colonization by S. aureus as compared to HIV-negative controls was observed (19{\%} vs 8{\%}, p=0.02), with a relevant percentage of penicillin resistant strains (15{\%} vs 0, p=0.24). Methicillin resistant strains were recovered only from HIV-positive subjects. Overall HIV-positive status was the only predictor of S. aureus colonization (OR 2.77, 95{\%} CI 1.03;7.41, p=0.04). Conclusions: The nasopharyngeal bacterial flora differs between HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects and appears relevant for possible development of staphylococcal infections in HIV-positive patients.},

abstract = {Different risk factors are suspected to be involved in malignant transformation of sinonasal papillomas and include HPV infection, tobacco smoking, occupational exposure, EGFR/KRAS mutations and DNA methylation alterations. In our study, 25 inverted sinonasal papillomas (ISPs), 5 oncocytic sinonasal papillomas (OSP) and 35 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) from 54 patients were genotyped for 10 genes involved in EGFR signalling. HPV-DNA detection was performed by in-situ hybridisation and LINE-1 methylation was quantitatively determined by bisulphite-pyrosequencing. High-risk HPV was observed only in 13{\%} of ISP-associated SCC and in 8{\%} of de novo-SCC patients. EGFR mutations occurred in 72{\%} of ISPs, 30{\%} of ISP-associated SCCs and 17{\%} of de novo-SCCs. At 5-year follow-up, SCC arose in only 30{\%} (6/20) of patients with EGFR-mutated ISPs compared to 76{\%} (13/17) of patients with EGFR-wild-type ISP (p = 0.0044). LINE-1 hypomethylation significantly increased from papilloma/early stage SCC to advanced stage SCC (p = 0.03) and was associated with occupational exposure (p = 0.01) and worse prognosis (p = 0.09). In conclusion, our results suggest that a small subset of these tumours could be related to HPV infection; EGFR mutations characterise those ISPs with a lower risk of developing into SCC; LINE-1 hypomethylation is associated with occupational exposure and could identify more aggressive nasal SCC.},

Thus, all countries are employing a lot of resources in order to test more and more subjects. For this purpose, there are different strategies, based on either direct or indirect tests. Among the first category, the main assays used for SARS-CoV-2 are based on a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Such tests can be performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs for the categories of those with symptoms and those potentially exposed. In order to integrate the molecular assays in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, a wide range of serology immunoassays (IAs) have also been developed. If we want to identify "immune" people in order to let them to come back to work, serology is the best (and probably the only) approach.},

abstract = {Objective: In the present study, we analyzed the inflammatory profiles of brain tissues obtained from patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) due to John Cunningham (JC) virus infection to identify potential prognostic factors. Methods: The study included seven patients (two men, five women) who had been pathologically diagnosed with PML, and all of whom were HIV negative. Fixed brain samples were analyzed via hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Kl{\"{u}}ver–Barrera (KB) staining. We then performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) specific to JC virus capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2/3) and lymphocyte surface markers (CD4, CD8, CD138, and PD-1). Results: The mean age at onset was 53.4, while the mean duration until biopsy/autopsy was 4.7 months. Four patients were included in the good prognosis (GP) group, while three were included in the poor prognosis (PP) group. Pathological analysis revealed a significantly larger number of CD4-positive T-cell infiltrations (P =.029) in the GP group, along with a preserved CD4:CD8 ratio. Larger numbers of CD138-positive plasma cells were also observed in the GP group (P =.029) than in the PP group. Linear regression analyses revealed a significant association between the numbers of CD138-positive plasma cells and PD-1-positive cells (R 2 = 0.80). Conclusions: Viral loads in the cerebrospinal fluid, a controlled inflammatory response mediated by CD4- and CD8-positive T cells, and plasma cells are associated with PML prognosis. Our findings further indicate that regulatory plasma cells may regulate inflammatory T-cell activity via a PD-1/PD-L1 immuno-checkpoint pathway, thereby protecting the uninfected brain from excessive immune-mediated damage during an active JC virus infection.},

abstract = { Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) outbreaks continue to occur despite widely used vaccination. Therefore, development of EHV-1 vaccines providing improved immunity and protection is ongoing. Here, an open reading frame 2 deletion mutant of the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 (Ab4$\Delta$ORF2) was tested as a vaccine candidate. Three groups of horses ( n = 8 each) were infected intranasally with Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 or the parent Ab4 virus or were kept as noninfected controls. Horses infected with Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 had reduced fever and nasal virus shedding compared to those infected with Ab4 but mounted similar adaptive immunity dominated by antibody responses. Nine months after the initial infection, all horses were challenged intranasally with Ab4. Previously noninfected horses (control/Ab4) displayed clinical signs, shed large amounts of virus, and developed cell-associated viremia. In contrast, 5/8 or 3/8 horses previously infected with Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 or Ab4, respectively, were fully protected from challenge infection as indicated by the absence of fever, clinical disease, nasal virus shedding, and viremia. All of these outcomes were significantly reduced in the remaining, partially protected 3/8 (Ab4$\Delta$ORF2/Ab4) and 5/8 (Ab4/Ab4) horses. Protected horses had EHV-1-specific IgG4/7 antibodies prior to challenge infection, and intranasal antibodies increased rapidly postchallenge. Intranasal inflammatory markers were not detectable in protected horses but quickly increased in control/Ab4 horses during the first week after infection. Overall, our data suggest that preexisting nasal IgG4/7 antibodies neutralize EHV-1, prevent viral entry, and thereby protect from disease, viral shedding, and cell-associated viremia. In conclusion, improved protection from challenge infection emphasizes further evaluation of Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 as a vaccine candidate.  IMPORTANCE Nasal equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) shedding is essential for virus transmission during outbreaks. Cell-associated viremia is a prerequisite for the most severe disease outcomes, abortion and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). Thus, protection from viremia is considered essential for preventing EHM. Ab4$\Delta$ORF2 vaccination prevented EHV-1 challenge virus replication in the upper respiratory tract in fully protected horses. Consequently, these neither shed virus nor developed cell-associated viremia. Protection from virus shedding and viremia during challenge infection in combination with reduced virulence at the time of vaccination emphasizes ORF2 deletion as a promising modification for generating an improved EHV-1 vaccine. During this challenge infection, full protection was linked to preexisting local and systemic EHV-1-specific antibodies combined with rapidly increasing intranasal IgG4/7 antibodies and lack of nasal type I interferon and chemokine induction. These host immune parameters may constitute markers of protection against EHV-1 and be utilized as indicators for improved vaccine development and informed vaccination strategies. },

abstract = {Pigs are anatomically, genetically and physiologically comparable to humans and represent a natural host for influenza A virus (IAV) infections. Thus, pigs may represent a relevant biomedical model for human IAV infections. We set out to investigate the systemic as well as the local immune response in pigs upon two subsequent intranasal infections with IAV H1N1pdm09. We detected decreasing numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes after the first infection. The simultaneous increase in the frequencies of proliferating cells correlated with an increase in infiltrating leukocytes in the lung. Enhanced perforin expression in $\alpha$$\beta$ and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells in the respiratory tract indicated a cytotoxic T cell response restricted to the route of virus entry such as the nose, the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage. Simultaneously, increasing frequencies of CD8$\alpha$$\alpha$ expressing $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells were observed rapidly after the first infection, which may have inhibited uncontrolled inflammation in the respiratory tract. Taking together, the results of this study demonstrate that experimental IAV infection in pigs mimics major characteristics of human seasonal IAV infections.},

From 555 households, 825 initial viral illness episodes occurred, resulting in 79 transmission events. The overall incidence of transmission was 1.14 events per 100 person-weeks. Risk of transmission incidence was associated with an index case age 1-4 years (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.35; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 1.40-3.96), coinfection as initial infection (IRR 1.94; 95{\%} CI 1.05-3.61) and no electricity in household (IRR 2.70; 95{\%} CI 1.41-5.00). Preventive interventions targeting preschool-age children in households in resource-limited settings may decrease the risk of transmission to vulnerable household members, such as young infants.},

abstract = {Self-collected nasal swabs offer a cheaper alternative to professional-collected swabs for influenza testing. However, the diagnostic accuracy of self-collection has not been quantitatively reviewed. We identified 14 studies that compared diagnostic accuracy of self-collected to professional-collected swabs in influenza symptomatic individuals. Self-collected swabs were found to be highly acceptable, simple and comfortable to use. Data from nine studies were meta-analyzed. Pooled sensitivity was 87{\%} (95{\%} CI: 80{\%}, 92{\%}) and specificity was 99{\%} (95{\%} CI: 98{\%}, 100{\%}), compared to professional-collected swabs in the diagnosis of influenza. Pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates were used to assess the potential bias that would be introduced in studies had self-collected rather than professional-collected samples been used. While self-collected swabbing should not replace the role of clinical testing, our findings support the use of self-collected swabs for influenza research and surveillance. This method will be an important tool for evaluating novel influenza vaccines and vaccination strategies.},

Based on the rapid increase in the rate of human infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Because no specific drugs or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available, early diagnosis and management are crucial for containing the outbreak. Here, we report a field-effect transistor (FET)-based biosensing device for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The performance of the sensor was determined using antigen protein, cultured virus, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from COVID-19 patients. Our FET device could detect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at concentrations of 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 fg/mL clinical transport medium. In addition, the FET sensor successfully detected SARS-CoV-2 in culture medium (limit of detection [LOD]: 1.6 × 10(1) pfu/mL) and clinical samples (LOD: 2.42 × 10(2) copies/mL). Thus, we have successfully fabricated a promising FET biosensor for SARS-CoV-2; our device is a highly sensitive immunological diagnostic method for COVID-19 that requires no sample pretreatment or labeling.},

abstract = {The nervous system regulates host immunity in complex ways. Vertebrate olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are located in direct contact with pathogens; however, OSNs' ability to detect danger and initiate immune responses is unclear. We report that nasal delivery of rhabdoviruses induces apoptosis in crypt OSNs via the interaction of the OSN TrkA receptor with the viral glycoprotein in teleost fish. This signal results in electrical activation of neurons and very rapid proinflammatory responses in the olfactory organ (OO), but dampened inflammation in the olfactory bulb (OB). CD8$\alpha$+ cells infiltrate the OO within minutes of nasal viral delivery, and TrkA blocking, but not caspase-3 blocking, abrogates this response. Infiltrating CD8$\alpha$+ cells were TCR$\alpha$$\beta$ T cells with a nonconventional phenotype that originated from the microvasculature surrounding the OB and not the periphery. Nasal delivery of viral glycoprotein (G protein) recapitulated the immune responses observed with the whole virus, and antibody blocking of viral G protein abrogated these responses. Ablation of crypt neurons in zebrafish resulted in increased susceptibility to rhabdoviruses. These results indicate a function for OSNs as a first layer of pathogen detection in vertebrates and as orchestrators of nasal–CNS antiviral immune responses.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused the shutdown of entire nations all over the world. In addition to mobility restrictions of people, the World Health Organization and the Governments have prescribed maintaining an inter-personal distance of 1.5 or 2 m (about 6 feet) from each other in order to minimize the risk of contagion through the droplets that we usually disseminate around us from nose and mouth. However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission. On-field studies carried out inside Wuhan Hospitals showed the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA in air samples collected in the hospitals and also in the surroundings, leading to the conclusion that the airborne route has to be considered an important pathway for viral diffusion. Similar findings are reported in analyses concerning air samples collected at the Nebraska University Hospital. On March 16th, we have released a Position Paper emphasizing the airborne route as a possible additional factor for interpreting the anomalous COVID-19 outbreaks in northern Italy, ranked as one of the most polluted areas in Europe and characterized by high particulate matter (PM) concentrations. The available information on the SARS-COV-2 spreading supports the hypothesis of airborne diffusion of infected droplets from person to person at a distance greater than two meters (6 feet). The inter-personal distance of 2 m can be reasonably considered as an effective protection only if everybody wears face masks in daily life activities.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary mode of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur through the spread of respiratory droplets. The objective of this study was to investigate droplet and splatter patterns resulting from common endoscopic endonasal procedures. STUDY DESIGN: Cadaver simulation series. SETTING: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to evaluate the quantity, size, and distance of droplets and splatter following each experimental condition. RESULTS: There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter noted in the measured surgical field in any direction after nasal endoscopy, septoplasty with microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty, cold-steel functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and all experimental conditions using an ultrasonic aspirator. Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, {\textless}1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, {\textless}1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, {\textless}1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter. The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures. The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction. Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.},

A suitable small animal model is needed to support the development of vaccines and therapies. Here we report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in golden (Syrian) hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells and areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia at 7 days after inoculation. We also found viral antigens in epithelial cells of the duodenum, and detected viral RNA in faeces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was not as efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss on days 6-7 post-inoculation or post-contact; all hamsters returned to their original weight within 14 days and developed neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden hamsters resemble those found in humans with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most lethal and untreatable central nervous system malignancy. The challenges to devise novel and effective anti-tumor therapies include difficulty in locating the precise tumor border for complete surgical resection, and rapid regrowth of residual tumor tissue after standard treatment. Repeatable and non-invasive intranasal application of neural stem cells (NSCs) was recently shown to enable clinically relevant delivery of therapy to tumors. Treatment with chemotactic NSCs demonstrated significant survival benefits when coupled with radiation and oncolytic virotherapy in preclinical models of GBM. In order to further augment the clinical applicability of this novel therapeutic platform, we postulate that the FDA-approved compound, methimazole (MT), can be safely utilized to delay the nasal clearance and improve the ability of NSCs to penetrate the olfactory epithelium for robust in vivo brain tumor targeting and therapeutic actions. METHODS: To examine the role of reversible reduction of the olfactory epithelial barrier in non-invasive intranasal delivery, we explored the unique pharmacologic effect of MT at a single dosage regimen. In our proof-of-concept studies, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), immunocytochemistry, and survival analysis were performed on glioma-bearing mice treated with a single dose of MT prior to intranasal anti-GBM therapy using an oncolytic virus (OV)-loaded NSCs. RESULTS: Based on histology and in vivo imaging, we found that disrupting the olfactory epithelium with MT effectively delays clearance and allows NSCs to persist in the nasal cavity for at least 24 h. MT pretreatment amplified the migration of NSCs to the tumor. The therapeutic advantage of this enhancement was quantitatively validated by tissue analysis and MRI tracking of NSCs loaded with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) in live animals. Moreover, we observed significant survival benefits in GBM-bearing mice treated with intranasal delivery of oncolytic virus-loaded NSCs following MT injection. Conclusion: Our work identified a novel pharmacologic strategy to accelerate the clinical application of the non-invasive NSCs-based therapeutic platform to tackle aggressive brain tumors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The response in the United States to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been hampered by a lack of aggressive testing for the infection. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing. Validation of alternative methods of specimen collection should include objective measures of the sufficiency of specimens for testing. A strong evidence base for diversifying testing modalities will improve tools to guide public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and rapidly spread throughout the world, resulting in a global public health emergency. The lack of vaccine and antivirals has brought an urgent need for an animal model. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we generated a mouse model expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) by using CRISPR/Cas9 knockin technology. In comparison with wild-type C57BL/6 mice, both young and aged hACE2 mice sustained high viral loads in lung, trachea, and brain upon intranasal infection. Although fatalities were not observed, interstitial pneumonia and elevated cytokines were seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected-aged hACE2 mice. Interestingly, intragastric inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 was seen to cause productive infection and lead to pulmonary pathological changes in hACE2 mice. Overall, this animal model described here provides a useful tool for studying SARS-CoV-2 transmission and pathogenesis and evaluating COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.},

abstract = {The human nasal epithelium is the primary site of exposure to influenza virus, the initiator of host responses to influenza and the resultant pathologies. Influenza virus may cause serious respiratory infection resulting in major complications, as well as severe impairment of the airways. Here, we elucidated the global transcriptomic changes during H3N2 infection of human nasal epithelial cells from multiple individuals. Using RNA sequencing, we characterized the differentially-expressed genes and pathways associated with changes occurring at the nasal epithelium following infection. We used in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial cell culture model derived from seven different donors who had no concurrent history of viral infections. Statistical analysis highlighted strong transcriptomic signatures significantly associated with 24 and 48 h after infection, but not at the earlier 8-h time point. In particular, we found that the influenza infection induced in the nasal epithelium early and altered responses in interferon gamma signaling, B-cell signaling, apoptosis, necrosis, smooth muscle proliferation, and metabolic alterations. These molecular events initiated at the infected nasal epithelium may potentially adversely impact the airway, and thus the genes we identified could serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for influenza infection and associated disease management.},

abstract = {Background: Influenza causes a significant annual disease burden, with characterization of the infecting virus important in clinical and public health settings. Rapid immunoassays are fast but insensitive, whereas real-time RT-PCR is sensitive but susceptible to genetic mutations and often requires multiple serial assays. The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay provides type and subtype/lineage identification of influenza A and B, including non-seasonal A viruses, in a single microarray-based assay with same day turnaround time. Objective: To evaluate key analytical performance characteristics of the FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay. Study design: Analytical sensitivity, cross-reactivity, and multi-site reproducibility were evaluated. Results: The limit of detection (LOD) for the FluChip-8G influenza A+B Assay ranged from 5.8 × 102–1.5 × 105 genome copies/mL, with most samples ∼2 × 103 genome copies/mL (∼160 genome copies/reaction). Fifty two (52) additional strains were correctly identified near the LOD, demonstrating robust reactivity. Two variant viruses (H1N1v and H3N2v) resulted in dual identification as both “non-seasonal influenza A” and A/H1N1pdm09. No reproducible cross-reactivity was observed for the 34 organisms tested, however, challenges with internal control inhibition due to crude growth matrix were observed. Lastly, samples tested near the LOD showed high reproducibility (97.0{\%} (95{\%} CI 94.7–98.7)) regardless of operator, site, reagent lot, or testing day. Conclusion: The FluChip-8G Influenza A+B Assay is an effective new method for detecting and identifying both seasonal and non-seasonal influenza viruses, as revealed by good sensitivity and robust reactivity to 52 unique strains of influenza virus. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity to non-influenza pathogens and high lab-to-lab reproducibility highlight the analytical performance of the assay as an alternative to real-time RT-PCR and sequencing-based assays. Clinical validation of the technology in a multi-site clinical study is the subject of a separate investigation.},

abstract = {Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a multi-host pathogen that can cause significant mortality in domestic, wild terrestrial and marine mammals. It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a life-threatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3™ qPCR thermocycler. Biomeme's extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.},

abstract = {Studies have found increased rates of dysosmia in patients with Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the mechanism that causes olfactory loss is unknown. The primary objective of this study was to explore local proinflammatory cytokine levels in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. Biopsies of the olfactory epithelium were taken from patients with confirmed COVID-19 as well as uninfected controls. Levels of tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1$\beta$) were assessed using ELISA and compared between groups. Average TNF-$\alpha$ levels were significantly increased in the olfactory epithelium of the COVID-19 group compared to the control group (P {\textless} 0.05). However, no differences in IL-1$\beta$ were seen between groups. Elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-$\alpha$ were seen in the olfactory epithelium in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that direct inflammation of the olfactory epithelium could play a role in the acute olfactory loss described in many patients with COVID-19.},

Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it. METHODS AND RESULTS: The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions. Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall. These procedural tricks would enhance diagnostic reliability.},

abstract = {Background: Influenza B viruses (IBVs) have never been isolated from natural-infected pigs in clinical cases, although the susceptibility of domestic pigs to experimental IBV infections had been confirmed as well as IBV-specific antibodies were detected from pigs under natural and experimental conditions. Objectives: We aimed to assess and investigate the activities for infection and circulation of IBVs in pigs. Methods: Annual active surveys for influenza have been implemented on swine populations in Taiwan since July 1998. Nasal swabs, trachea, lungs, and blood from pigs were tested using virological and serological assays for influenza. Gene sequences of influenza viral isolates were determined and characterized. Preliminary sero-epidemiological data for influenza virus were investigated. Results: Three strains of IBV were isolated and identified from natural-infected pigs in 2014. Genetic characterization revealed the highest identities ({\textgreater}99{\%}) of molecular sequence with the contemporary IBVs belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 genetic clade of Victoria lineage in the phylogenetic trees for all 8 genes. IBV-specific antibodies were detected in 31 (0.2{\%}; 95{\%}CI: 0.1{\%}-0.2{\%}) of 15 983 swine serum samples from 29 (2.8{\%}; 95{\%}CI: 1.9{\%}-3.9{\%}) of 1039 farm visits under annual active surveys from 2007 through 2017. Seropositive cases have been found sparsely in 1-5 of test prefectures every year except 2015 and 2017 as well as scattered loosely over 26 townships/districts of 11 prefectures in Taiwan cumulatively in 11 years. Conclusions: Influenza B viruse infections from humans to pigs remained sporadic and accidental currently in Taiwan but might have paved potential avenues for newly emerging zoonotic influenza in the future.},

The reasons for this are not clear and may include differences in immunogenicity. We report a Phase IV open-label study on the immunogenicity of a single dose of quadrivalent LAIV (Fluenz™ Tetra) in children during the 2015/16 season, to investigate the antibody responses to different strains. Eligible children were enrolled to receive LAIV; nasal samples were collected before and approximately 4 weeks after immunization. There was a significant increase in nasal immunoglobulin (Ig)A to the H3N2, B/Victoria lineage (B/Brisbane) and B/Yamagata lineage (B/Phuket) components, but not to the H1N1 component. The fold change in nasal IgA response was inversely proportional to the baseline nasal IgA titre for H1N1, H3N2 and B/Brisbane. We investigated possible associations that may explain baseline nasal IgA, including age and prior vaccination status, but found different patterns for different antigens, suggesting that the response is multi-factorial. Overall, we observed differences in immune responses to different viral strains included in the vaccine; the reasons for this require further investigation.},

Because of the heavy impact of COVID-19 spread, cancer treatments have necessarily been de-prioritized, thus exposing patients to increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to delayed care. In this scenario, cancer specialists need to assess critical oncology patients case by case to carefully balance risk vs benefit in treating tumors and preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report early insights into how the management of patients with sinonasal and anterior skull base cancer might be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for preoperative tests, indications for immediate care vs possible delayed treatment, and warnings relating to dural resection and intracranial dissection, given the potential neurotropism of SARS-CoV2 and practical suggestions for managing cancer care in a period of limited resources. We also postulate some thoughts on the promising role of telemedicine in multidisciplinary case discussions and posttreatment surveillance.},

abstract = {During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals are at the forefront of managing the highly infectious coronavirus. As the most common route of transmission is via aerosols and droplet inhalation, it is critical for healthcare workers to have the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) including gowns, masks and goggles. Surgical masks are not effective in preventing the influenza and SARS, so they are unlikely to be able to resist contaminated aerosols from entering the respiratory system. Therefore, it is vital to use respirators which have been proven to offer better protection against droplets, aerosols and fluid penetration and which form a tight seal around the mouth and nose. Various types of respirators are used in healthcare settings, such as half-mask filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). The most commonly used FFR is the N95 disposable respirator, which is tight fitting and has a 95{\%} or above particle filtering efficiency for a median particle size of 0.3 µm. This review discusses respirators, their purpose, types, clinical efficiency and proper donning and doffing techniques.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether children play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to other children and adults, and to gain insight into symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in children. DESIGN: Analysis of national COVID-19 notifications and prospective observational study in families with children. METHOD: Information about COVID-19 patients and their contacts was obtained from the registration systems used by the public health services. In an ongoing study, patients with COVID-19 were asked to participate if they have a family with children. On two occasions nose-throat swabs and blood were collected for PCR analysis and determination of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The notifications suggest that transmission finds place mainly between adults and to a lesser extent between parents and children. For the family study, data were available from 54 households with a total of 227 participants. In families of a confirmed COVID-19 patient, children between 1 and 11 years were less often positive in PCR and serology than older children and adults. CONCLUSION: The study gives no indications that children play an important role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Children can indeed become infected, but transmission mainly takes place between adult peers and from adult family members to children. Transmission among children or from children to adults, as is known in influenza, appears to be less common. Ongoing studies should provide important information for further decision-making on control measures, such as closure of schools.},

Primary nasal epithelial cells (pNECs) provide a useful method to study immune responses in pregnancy. pNECs were obtained by nasal brushings from pregnant and non-pregnant women with and without asthma. pNECS were infected in vitro with major group Rhinovirus 43 (RV43) and seasonal influenza (H3N2). Following infection, pNECs showed measurable quantities of interferon (IFN)-$\lambda$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-8, IP-10 and MIP1-$\alpha$. pNECs provide a safe and effective method for studying respiratory epithelial cell responses during pregnancy.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection constitutes an annual health burden across the globe. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are central in antiviral defense because of their superior capacity to produce type I IFNs in response to viruses. Dendritic cells (DCs) differ depending on their anatomical location. However, only limited host-pathogen data are available from the initial site of infection in humans. In this study, we investigated how human tonsil PDCs, likely exposed to virus because of their location, responded to IAV infection compared with peripheral blood PDCs. In tonsils, unlike in blood, PDCs are the most frequent DC subset. Both tonsil and blood PDCs expressed several genes necessary for pathogen recognition and immune response, generally in a similar pattern. MxA, a protein that renders cells resistant to IAV infection, was detected in both tonsil and blood PDCs. However, despite steady-state MxA expression and contrary to previous reports, at high IAV concentrations (typically cytopathic to other immune cells), both tonsil and blood PDCs supported IAV infection. IAVexposure resulted in PDC maturation by upregulation of CD86 expression and IFN-a secretion. Interestingly, blood PDCs secreted 10-fold more IFN-a in response to IAV compared with tonsil PDCs. Tonsil PDCs also had a dampened cytokine response to purified TLR ligands compared with blood PDCs. Our findings suggest that tonsil PDCs may be less responsive to IAV than blood PDCs, highlighting the importance of studying immune cells at their proposed site of function.},

abstract = {Objective: The main objective of this study was to analyze the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. Materials and Methods: A selection was made of 155 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity treated at the University Hospital of Geneva. HPV detection was performed at the Laboratory of Molecular Pathology using a PCR technique followed by in situ hybridization of the viral DNA. Sections were studied for the immunohistochemical expression of P16INK4a. Results: The presence of HPV-DNA was found in 3.3{\%} of the cases (95{\%} CI: 1.3{\%}–7.5{\%}). The only HPV genotype found was HR-HPV 16. In contrast, 7.7{\%} (95{\%} CI: 1.3{\%}–7.5{\%}) of the cases showed an overexpression of the P16INK4a. We found no significant differences in age, sex, or tobacco and alcohol consumption in relation to the P16INK4a or HPV positivity. Conclusions: Human papillomavirus is rarely associated with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity. Our results suggest that an overexpression of the P16INK4a protein, even in the absence of the virus, is linked to an increase in the survival of the patient.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVES: A cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among Italian tourists visiting India. We report here the epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the tourists. METHODS: Information was collected on demographic details, travel and exposure history, comorbidities, timelines of events, date of symptom onset and duration of hospitalization from the 16 Italian tourists and an Indian with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic and treatment data was abstracted from their medical records and all tourists were followed up till their recovery or discharge or death. Throat and deep nasal swab specimens were collected on days 3, 8, 15, 18, 23 and 25 to evaluate viral clearance. RESULTS: A group of 23 Italian tourists reached New Delhi, India, on February 21, 2020 and along with three Indians visited several tourist places in Rajasthan. By March 3, 2020, 17 of the 26 (attack rate: 65.4{\%}) had become positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these 17 patients, nine were symptomatic, while eight did not show any symptoms. Of the nine who developed symptoms, six were mild, one was severe and two were critically ill. The median duration between the day of confirmation for COVID-19 and RT-PCR negativity was 18 days (range: 12-23 days). Two patients died with a case fatality of 11.8 per cent. INTERPRETATION {\&} CONCLUSIONS: This study reconfirms higher rates of transmission among close contacts and therefore, public health measures such as physical distancing, personal hygiene and infection control measures are necessary to prevent transmission.},

Although herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid is rare, it produces quite a huge pressure and panic on patients. Quite a lot cosmetic practitioners have no awareness of preventing, diagnosing, and giving correct treatment in time due to lack of experience. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 24-year-old woman presented with erythema, crusted papules, pain and swelling on the nose after receiving the injection of hyaluronic acid. A swab of the discharge fluid was obtained for bacterial and viral culture, showing positive for herpes simplex virus. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent antiviral therapy with acyclovir 400 mg, 3 times daily for seven days. OUTCOMES: After a week of antiviral treatment, the clinical signs improved. CONCLUSION: Herpes reactivation after the injection of hyaluronic acid is quite rare but needed sufficient attention of cosmetic practitioners to make the proper diagnosis, prevention and treatment.},

abstract = {Objective: To analyze the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the epidemiological history, clinical symptoms, signs, laboratory examinations, chest imaging, treatment and the short-term prognosis of 31 cases of 2019-nCoV was conducted. The patients were diagnosed between January 25th, 2020 and February 21st, 2020 in 21 hospitals in 17 cities of six provinces (autonomous region) of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Hebei, Henan and Shandong. Results: The age of the 31 children with 2019-nCoV infection was 7 years and 1 month (6 months-17 years). Nine cases (29{\%}) were imported cases. Other 21 cases (68{\%}) had contact with confirmed infected adults. One case (3{\%}) had contact with asymptomatic returnees from Wuhan. Among the 31 children, 28 patients (90{\%}) were family cluster cases. The clinical types were asymptomatic type in 4 cases (13{\%}), mild type in 13 cases (42{\%}), and common type in 14 cases (45{\%}). No severe or critical type existed. The most common symptom was fever (n=20, 65{\%}), including 1 case of high fever, 9 cases of moderate fever, 10 cases of low fever. Fever lasted from 1 day to 9 days. The fever of fifteen cases lasted for ≤3 d, while in other 5 cases lasted {\textgreater}3 d. Other symptoms included cough (n=14, 45{\%}), fatigue (n=3, 10{\%}) and diarrhea (n=3, 10{\%}). Pharyngalgia, runny nose, dizziness, headache and vomiting were rare. In the early stage, the total leukocytes count in peripheral blood decreased in 2 cases (6{\%}), the lymphocytes count decreased in 2 cases (6{\%}), and the platelet count increased in 2 cases (6{\%}).Elevation of C-reactive protein (10{\%}, 3/30), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (19{\%}, 4/21), procalcitonin (4{\%},1/28), liver enzyme (22{\%}, 6/27) and muscle enzyme (15{\%}, 4/27) occurred in different proportions. Renal function and blood glucose were normal. There were abnormal chest CT changes in 14 cases, including 9 cases with patchy ground glass opacities and nodules, mostly located in the lower lobe of both lungs near the pleural area. After receiving supportive treatment, the viral nucleic acid turned negative in 25 cases within 7-23 days. Among them, 24 children (77{\%}) recovered and were discharged from hospital. No death occurred. Conclusions: In this case series, 2019-nCoV infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) in northern China are mainly caused by close family contact. Clinical types are asymptomatic, mild and common types. Clinical manifestations and laboratory examination results are nonspecific. Close contact history of epidemiology, nucleic acid detection and chest imaging are important bases for diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection. After general treatment, the short-term prognosis is good.},

abstract = {Background Human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated in 1962 and has aroused public concern recently because of a nationwide outbreak among children in 2014-2015 in the USA. The symptoms include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough and muscle pains. It might be associated with severe respiratory illness in individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions and its potential association with acute flaccid myelitis is under investigation. In Asia, EV-D68 cases have been reported in several countries. The study We aimed to understand the EV-D68 prevalence and their genetic diversity in Hong Kong children. Methods A total of 10 695 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from hospitalised patients aged {\textless}18 years were collected from September 2014 to December 2015 in two regional hospitals. NPAs tested positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) were selected for genotyping. For those identified as EV-D68, their complete coding sequences (CDSs) were obtained by Sanger sequencing. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was constructed using all EV-D68 complete coding sequences available in GenBank (n=482). Results 2662/10 695 (24.9{\%}) were tested positive with EV/RV and 882/2662 (33.1{\%}) were selected randomly and subjected to molecular classification. EV-D68 was detected in 15 (1.70{\%}) samples from patients with clinical presentations ranging from wheezing to pneumonia and belonged to subclade B3. Eight CDSs were successfully obtained. A total of 10 amino acid residue polymorphisms were detected in the viral capsid proteins, proteases, ATPase and RNA polymerase. Conclusion B3 subclade was the only subclade found locally. Surveillance of EV-D68 raises public awareness and provides the information to determine the most relevant genotypes for vaccine development.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in sinonasal inverted papilloma (SIP) and sinonasal oncocytic papilloma (SOP) from a single institution and whether p16 can serve as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. This study included 49 subjects with SIP and 36 subjects with SOP. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were used to extract genomic DNA, and HPV detection was performed by utilizing a valid nested polymerase chain reaction approach that can detect all known HPV subtypes. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of p16 in all tumor sections. The presence of HPV DNA was found in 6.1{\%} (3/49) of the SIP patients and 11.1{\%} (4/36) of the SOP patients. All identified HPV subtypes in SIP were high-risk HPV, including HPV-16 (two patients) and HPV-58 (one patient). Regarding SOP, there were three patients positive for HPV-16 and one with low-risk HPV (type 6). In total, 11/49 (22.4{\%}) SIP lesions and 10/36 (27.8{\%}) SOP lesions were considered p16 positive, with p16 staining in more than 70{\%} of tumor cells. There was only one SIP and one SOP that were positive for both HPV (high-risk HPV type 16) and p16 staining. HPV does not play an etiologic role in inverted papilloma or oncocytic papilloma of the sinonasal region. p16 immunostaining should not be used as a surrogate marker to evaluate the HPV infection status in these lesions.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitic illness of childhood associated with coronary artery dilatation, coronary artery aneurysm, arrhythmia, sudden death, and other serious cardiovascular diseases. Up to date, the etiology of KD remains unclear; however, epidemiological characteristics indicate that it may be related to as-yet-undefined pathogen infection. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 19-month-old boy had a fever of unknown origin at 38°C for 9 days without rash, runny nose and cough. DIAGNOSIS: The boy was diagnosed with incomplete KD (IKD) coincident with influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus. INTERVENTIONS: He was received treatments including human immunoglobulin (2 g/kg), aspirin (30∼50 mg/kg.d), and dipyridamole (3∼5 mg/kg.d). OUTCOMES: After 24 hours of human immunoglobulin infusion, his body temperature returned normal. After hospitalization for 6 days, his symptoms disappeared and discharged from the hospital. LESSONS: More attention should be paid to the correlation between KD and pathogen infection, especially the new influenza virus H1N1. The potential mechanism underlying viral infection-mediated KD is worthy of further investigation, which may provide scientific evidence for the pathogenesis of KD.},

abstract = {Objective: To investigate the genetic and epigenetic differences between human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and HPV-negative OPSCC. Methods: Microarray data of HPV-positive and -negative OPSCC were retrieved from NCBI GEO datasets. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified by performing differential expression analysis. A functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the biological processes and signaling pathways that DEGs and DE-miRNAs were involved in, respectively. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed to identify hub genes. miRNA-target network and miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network were each constructed in order to identify risk-marker miRNAs. An miRNA-target-pathway network was constructed in order to explore the function of identified risk-marker miRNAs. Results: Microarray data from 3 datasets (GSE39366, GSE40774, and GSE55550) was included and analyzed. The PPI network identified 3 hub genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2). MiR-107 and miR-142-3p were found to play the most significant role in both the DE-miRNA-target network as well as in the miRNA-miRNA functional synergistic network. MiR-107 was involved in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting many genes (CAV1, CDK6, MYB, and SERPINB5) and regulating the p53 signaling pathway, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the autophagy pathway. In addition, miR-142-3p was implicated in HPV-induced tumorigenesis by targeting the PPFIA1 gene and regulating transcriptional dysregulation and other cancerous pathways. Conclusion: Three genes (VCAM1, UBD, and RPA2), two miRNAs (miR-107 and miR-142-3p), and four pathways (p53, PI3K-Akt, autophagy, and transcription dysregulation in cancer) were identified to play critical roles in distinguishing HPV-positive OPSCC from HPV-negative OPSCC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability of self-collection for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses because swab collections for SARS-CoV-2 put health workers at risk of infection and require use of personal protective equipment (PPE). METHODS: In a prospective study, patients from two states in Australia attending dedicated COVID-19 collection clinics were offered the option to first self-collect (SC) nasal and throat swabs (SCNT) prior to health worker collect (HC) using throat and nasal swabs (Site 1) or throat and nasopharyngeal swabs (Site 2). Samples were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 as well as common respiratory viruses. Concordance of results between methods was assessed using Cohen's kappa ($\kappa$) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values were recorded for all positive results as a surrogate measure for viral load. RESULTS: Of 236 patients sampled by HC and SC, 25 had SARS-CoV-2 (24 by HC and 25 by SC) and 63 had other respiratory viruses (56 by HC and 58 by SC). SC was highly concordant with HC ($\kappa$ = 0.890) for all viruses including SARS-CoV-2 and more concordant than HC to positive results by any method ($\kappa$ = 0.959 vs 0.933). Mean SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and N-gene, rhinovirus and parainfluenza Ct values did not differ between HC and SCNT. CONCLUSIONS: Self-collection of nasal and throat swabs offers a reliable alternative to health worker collection for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and provides patients with easier access to testing, reduces exposure of the community and health workers to those being tested and reduces requirement for PPE.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: We compared clinical, laboratory, radiological, and outcome features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) with pneumonia, with vs without diarrhea. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, single-center analysis of 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in Wuhan Union Hospital, China, from January 19 through February 7, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and in some cases, immunoglobulins, complement, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines. Virus RNA was detected in stool samples by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 26 (31{\%}) had diarrhea. The duration of fever and dyspnea in patients with diarrhea was significantly longer than those without diarrhea (all P {\textless} .05). Stool samples from a higher proportion of patients with diarrhea tested positive for virus RNA (69{\%}) than from patients without diarrhea (17{\%}) (P {\textless} .001). As of February 19, a lower proportion of patients with diarrhea had a negative result from the latest throat swab for SARS-CoV-2 (77{\%}) than patients without diarrhea (97{\%}) (P = .010), during these patients' hospitalization. Of 76 patients with a negative result from their latest throat swab test during hospitalization, a significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea had a positive result from the retest for SARS-CoV-2 in stool (45{\%}) than patients without diarrhea (20{\%}) (P = .039). CONCLUSIONS: At a single center in Wuhan, China, 31{\%} of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia had diarrhea. A significantly higher proportion of patients with diarrhea have virus RNA in stool than patients without diarrhea. Elimination of SARS-CoV-2 from stool takes longer than elimination from the nose and throat.},

abstract = {Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus, endemic in Central and West Africa. This viral zoonosis was introduced into the United States in 2003 via African rodents imported for the pet trade and caused 37 human cases, all linked to exposure to MPXV-infected black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs have since become a useful model of MPXV disease, utilized for testing of potential medical countermeasures. In this study, we used recombinant MPXV containing the firefly luciferase gene (luc) and in vivo imaging technology to characterize MPXV pathogenesis in the black-tailed prairie dog in real time. West African (WA) MPXV could be visualized using in vivo imaging in the nose, lymph nodes, intestines, heart, lung, kidneys, and liver as early as day 6 post infection (p.i.). By day 9 p.i., lesions became visible on the skin and in some cases in the spleen. After day 9 p.i., luminescent signal representing MPXV replication either increased, indicating a progression to what would be a fatal infection, or decreased as infection was resolved. Use of recombinant luc+ MPXV allowed for a greater understanding of how MPXV disseminates throughout the body in prairie dogs during the course of infection. This technology will be used to reduce the number of animals required in future pathogenesis studies as well as aid in determining the effectiveness of potential medical countermeasures.},

abstract = {Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), one of the main circulating HCoVs worldwide, causes respiratory tract illnesses like runny nose, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Recently, a severe respiratory illness outbreak of HCoV-NL63 has been reported in a long-term care facility. Sambucus FormosanaNakai, a species of elderberry, is a traditional medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antiviral potential. The study investigated the antiviral activity of Sambucus FormosanaNakai stem ethanol extract and some phenolic acid constituents against HCoV-NL63. The extract was less cytotoxic and concentration-dependently increased anti-HCoV-NL63 activities, including cytopathicity, sub-G1 fraction, virus yield (IC50 = 1.17 $\mu$g/ml), plaque formation (IC50 = 4.67 $\mu$g/ml) and virus attachment (IC50 = 15.75 $\mu$g/ml). Among the phenolic acid constituents in Sambucus FormosanaNakai extract, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and gallic acid sustained the anti-HCoV-NL63 activity that was ranked in the following order of virus yield reduction: caffeic acid (IC50 = 3.54 $\mu$M) {\textgreater} chlorogenic acid (IC50 = 43.45 $\mu$M) {\textgreater} coumaric acid (IC50 = 71.48 $\mu$M). Caffeic acid significantly inhibited the replication of HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner, and specifically blocked virus attachment (IC50 = 8.1 $\mu$M). Therefore, the results revealed that Sambucus Formosana Nakai stem ethanol extract displayed the strong anti-HCoV-NL63 potential; caffeic acid could be the vital component with anti-HCoV-NL63 activity. The finding could be helpful for developing antivirals against HCoV-NL63.},

abstract = {Human behaviour is central to transmission of SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and changing behaviour is crucial to preventing transmission in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions. Isolation and social distancing measures, including edicts to stay at home, have been brought into place across the globe to reduce transmission of the virus, but at a huge cost to individuals and society. In addition to these measures, we urgently need effective interventions to increase adherence to behaviours that individuals in communities can enact to protect themselves and others: use of tissues to catch expelled droplets from coughs or sneezes, use of face masks as appropriate, hand-washing on all occasions when required, disinfecting objects and surfaces, physical distancing, and not touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. There is an urgent need for direct evidence to inform development of such interventions, but it is possible to make a start by applying behavioural science methods and models.},

abstract = {An essential aspect of goal-directed decision-making is selecting actions based on anticipated consequences, a process that involves the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and potentially, the plasticity of dendritic spines in this region. To investigate this possibility, we trained male and female mice to nose poke for food reinforcers, or we delivered the same number of food reinforcers non-contingently to separate mice. We then decreased the likelihood of reinforcement for trained mice, requiring them to modify action– outcome expectations. In a separate experiment, we blocked action– outcome updating via chemogenetic inactivation of the OFC. In both cases, successfully selecting actions based on their likely consequences was associated with fewer immature, thin-shaped dendritic spines and a greater proportion of mature, mushroom-shaped spines in the ventrolateral OFC. This pattern was distinct from spine loss associated with aging, and we identified no effects on hippocampal CA1 neurons. Given that the OFC is involved in prospective calculations of likely outcomes, even when they are not observable, constraining spinogenesis while preserving mature spines may be important for solidifying durable expectations. To investigate causal relationships, we inhibited the RNA-binding protein fragileXmental retardation protein (encoded by Fmr1), which constrains dendritic spine turnover. Ventrolateral OFC-selective Fmr1 knockdown recapitulated the behavioral effects of inducible OFC inactivation (and lesions; also shown here), impairing action– outcome conditioning, and caused dendritic spine excess. Our findings suggest that a proper balance of dendritic spine plasticity within the OFC is necessary for one's ability to select actions based on anticipated consequences.},

Although some other livestock animal species have been shown to be susceptible to MERS-CoV, it is not fully understood why the spread of the virus in these animal species has not been observed in the field. In this study, we used rabbits to further characterize the transmission potential of MERS-CoV. In line with the presence of MERS-CoV receptor in the rabbit nasal epithelium, high levels of viral RNA were shed from the nose following virus inoculation. However, unlike MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries, these rabbits did not develop clinical manifestations including nasal discharge and did shed only limited amounts of infectious virus from the nose. Consistently, no transmission by contact or airborne routes was observed in rabbits. Our data indicate that despite relatively high viral RNA levels produced, low levels of infectious virus are excreted in the upper respiratory tract of rabbits as compared to dromedary camels, thus resulting in a lack of viral transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: International experience with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) suggests it poses a significant risk of infectious transmission to skull base surgeons, due to high nasal viral titers and the unknown potential for aerosol generation during endonasal instrumentation. The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to obtain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. METHODS: Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2 mg per 10 mL) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during nonpowered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling after nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS: Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30 cm, extending to 66 cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all conditions tested. CONCLUSION: We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an "aerosol-generating surgery" to convey this unique risk, and this supports the need for protective personal protective equipment.},

Comparing midturbinate samples to nasopharyngeal specimens of 321 subjects, positive percentage agreement varied from 42{\%} to 94{\%} depending on both target virus and assay used. Negative percentage agreements ranged from 98{\%} to 100{\%} for both methods and sample type comparison. The Idylla™ assay showed excellent performance compared to the GeneXpert{\textregistered} assay for the detection of influenza virus. The study also showed a slightly better performance for nasopharyngeal sampling compared to the use of a midturbinate swab.},

abstract = {Here we show that treatment of the HPV16-positive tonsillar cancer cell line HN26 with DNA alkylating cancer drug melphalan-induced p53 and activated apoptosis. Melphalan reduced the levels of RNA polymerase II and cellular transcription factor Sp1 that were associated with HPV16 DNA. The resulting inhibition of transcription caused a rapid loss of the HPV16 early mRNAs encoding E6 and E7 as a result of their inherent instability. As a consequence of HPV16 E6 and E7 down-regulation, the DNA damage inflicted on the cells by melphalan caused induction of p53 and activation of apoptosis in the HN26 cells. The BARD1-negative phenotype of the HN26 cells may have contributed to the failure to repair DNA damage caused by melphalan, as well as to the efficient apoptosis induction. Finally, nude mice carrying the HPV16 positive tonsillar cancer cells responded better to melphalan than to cisplatin, the chemotherapeutic drug of choice for tonsillar cancer. We concluded that the short half-life of the HPV16 E6 and E7 mRNAs renders HPV16-driven tonsillar cancer cells particularly sensitive to DNA damaging agents such as melphalan since melphalan both inhibits transcription and causes DNA damage.},

abstract = {Over the past three months, the world has faced an unprecedented health hazard. The World Health Organization has announced a pandemic infection with an unknown species of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Spreading mainly through the droplet route, the virus causes mild symptoms in the majority of cases, the most common being: fever (80{\%}), dry cough (56{\%}), fatigue (22{\%}) and muscle pain (7{\%}); less common symptoms include a sore throat, a runny nose, diarrhea, hemoptysis and chills. A life-threatening complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection is an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which occurs more often in older adults, those with immune disorders and co-morbidities. Severe forms of the infection, being an indication for treatment in the intensive care unit, comprise acute lung inflammation, ARDS, sepsis and septic shock. The article presents basic information about etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics (with particular emphasis on the importance of tomocomputer imaging), clinical picture, treatment and prevention of the infection. It goes on to emphasize the specific risks of providing anesthesiology and intensive care services. Due to the fact that effective causal treatment is not yet available and the number of infections and deaths increases day by day, infection prevention and strict adherence to recommendations of infection control organizations remain the basis for fighting the virus.},

We aimed to describe the viral detection results across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS: A retrospective study of 301 confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, were included. Demographic characteristics of the patients were collected. Upper respiratory specimens (throat and/or nasal swabs) were obtained and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Period of viral infection and the contagious stage were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 301 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the median age was 58 years and 51.2 {\%} were male. The median period between symptoms presence and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results was 16 days (IQR, 10-23, N = 301). The median period between symptoms presence and an effective negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result was 20 days (IQR, 17-24; N = 216). Infected patient ≥65 years old stayed contagious longer (22 days vs 19 days, p = 0.015). Although two consecutive negative results were confirmed in 70 patients, 30 {\%} of them had positive viral test results for the third time. Using specimens from nasal swabs to run the RT-PCR test showed a higher positive rate than using specimens from throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale investigation with 1113 RT-PCR test results from 301 COVID-19 patients showed that the average contagious period of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was 20 days. Longer observation period and more than 2 series of negative viral test are necessary for patients ≥65 years.},

abstract = {The number of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly increased, although the WHO declared a pandemic. However, drugs that function against SARS-CoV-2 have not been established. SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor of the SARS coronavirus. SARS coronavirus and coronavirus 229E, the cause of the common cold, replicate through cell-surface and endosomal pathways using a protease, the type II transmembrane protease. To examine the effects of protease inhibitors on the replication of coronavirus 229E, we pretreated primary cultures of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells with camostat or nafamostat, each of which has been used for the treatment of pancreatitis and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation. HNE cells were then infected with coronavirus 229E, and viral titers in the airway surface liquid of the cells were examined. Pretreatment with camostat (0.1-10 $\mu$g/mL) or nafamostat (0.01-1 $\mu$g/mL) reduced the titers of coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, a significant amount of type II transmembrane protease protein was detected in the airway surface liquid of HNE cells. Additionally, interferons have been reported to have antiviral effects against SARS coronavirus. The additive effects of interferons on the inhibitory effects of other candidate drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as lopinavir, ritonavir and favipiravir, have also been studied. These findings suggest that protease inhibitors of this type may inhibit coronavirus 229E replication in human airway epithelial cells at clinical concentrations. Protease inhibitors, interferons or the combination of these drugs may become candidate drugs to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), one of the causes of the common cold, exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and $\beta$(2)-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. METHODS: Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. RESULTS: Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-$\beta$. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2'2'-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.},

Methods: The pharynx swab specimens for pathogenic detection were collected from acute respiratory infection (ARI) cases in the fever clinic of the sentinel hospital in Jinhua area from 2014 to 2017. Descriptive statistics method was used to analyze the clinical features and pathogenics characteristics of the patients infected with H3N2 influenza virus. The t test or $\chi$(2) test of independent samples were used for comparison between groups. Results: A total of 3 803 cases of acute respiratory infection (ARI) were reported in the sentinel hospital in Jinhua area from 2014 to 2017. Among them, 245 cases (6.4{\%}) of H3N2 influenza were diagnosed, including 153 males (62.4{\%}) and 92 females (37.6{\%}), aged from 0.5 to 95 years, with an average age of (50.1+15.7) years. They were divided into 5 age groups, with 107 (43.7{\%}) patients aged 60 years and older. The incidence of major diseases was 43.7{\%}. There was no significant difference in the gender in different age groups ($\chi$(2)=4.581, P=0.333). The seasonal peak of H3N2 influenza A virus infection was mainly in summer (In June-September), but was also seen in other months. In the 4 years from 2014 to 2017, there were a total of 4 peaks, which occurred in July-September, July-August, June-August, and June-August. The body temperature of most patients (73.1{\%}) was between 38.0 and 38.9 ℃. The main positive signs of H3N2 influenza A virus infection were different degrees of pharyngeal hyperemia and tonsillar enlargement. Fever ({\textgreater}38 ℃), cough, dizziness, fatigue, sore throat, headache, chills, shortness of breath, runny nose, myalgia, expectoration, nasal congestion were the main symptoms of H3N2 cases. The proportion of abnormal X-ray/CT manifestations in H3N2 influenza A virus infection cases was lower than that of other influenza viruses. 89.8{\%} of the patients were positive for H3N2 influenza A. The average lymphocyte count was (1.1±0.5) × 10(9)/L, total platelet count (157±39) × 10(9)/L in H3N2 influenza A infection group, which were lower than those in other influenza positive patients [(1.2±0.6)×10(9)/L and (165±42) × 10(9)/L], while the neutrophil count (3.6±0.8) × 10(9)/L was higher than that in other influenza positive patients (3.4±1.0) × 10(9)/L(all P{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: Patients with H3N2 influenza A in Jinhua mostly presented with throat congestion and tonsillar enlargement in varying degrees, fever ({\textgreater}38 ℃), cough and sputum production. The seasonal peak of influenza A was in summer (June-September). Elderly aged 60 years or older were the susceptible group.},

However, not many field studies investigated the association between BoHV-4 and subclinical endometritis (SCE). In the present study, the association between the intrauterine presence of BoHV-4 and SCE diagnosed during artificial insemination (AI) was examined on two dairy farms in Belgium. An immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and an enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) were used to screen the serum for anti-BoHV-4 antibodies. A SYBR green based one step real time qPCR was used to detect and quantify BoHV-4 (ORF20) in nasal, uterine and vaginal samples collected at AI. A reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) was used to detect mRNA (gB) as proof of a productive BoHV-4 infection. BoHV-4 was detected in 39.4{\%} (farm A)/23.8{\%} (farm B) of the nasal samples, 48.5{\%} (farm A)/19.0{\%} (farm B) of the uterine samples and 51.5{\%} (farm A)/42.9{\%} (farm B) of the vaginal samples. Active replication was only detected in farm A in 38.5{\%} of the BoHV-4 positive nasal samples and in 5.9{\%} positive cases of the vaginal samples. The prevalence of SCE diagnosed at AI was 45.5{\%} and 42.9{\%} in farm A and farm B, respectively. The presence of SCE was associated with a reduced pregnancy outcome at artificial insemination (AI) (P＜0.001). The occurrence of SCE at AI was not associated with the presence of latent or productive BoHV4 infections in the uterus nor in the vagina and nose (P＞0.05).},

Clinical information on airway management and expert recommendations in these patients are urgently needed. By analysing a two-centre retrospective observational case series from Wuhan, China, a panel of international airway management experts discussed the results and formulated consensus recommendations for the management of tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients. Of 202 COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency tracheal intubation, most were males (n=136; 67.3{\%}) and aged 65 yr or more (n=128; 63.4{\%}). Most patients (n=152; 75.2{\%}) were hypoxaemic (Sao(2) {\textless}90{\%}) before intubation. Personal protective equipment was worn by all intubating healthcare workers. Rapid sequence induction (RSI) or modified RSI was used with an intubation success rate of 89.1{\%} on the first attempt and 100{\%} overall. Hypoxaemia (Sao(2) {\textless}90{\%}) was common during intubation (n=148; 73.3{\%}). Hypotension (arterial pressure {\textless}90/60 mm Hg) occurred in 36 (17.8{\%}) patients during and 45 (22.3{\%}) after intubation with cardiac arrest in four (2.0{\%}). Pneumothorax occurred in 12 (5.9{\%}) patients and death within 24 h in 21 (10.4{\%}). Up to 14 days post-procedure, there was no evidence of cross infection in the anaesthesiologists who intubated the COVID-19 patients. Based on clinical information and expert recommendation, we propose detailed planning, strategy, and methods for tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.},

abstract = {Enzootic nasal adenocarcinoma (ENA) of goats, characterized by transformation of epithelial cells of the ethmoid turbinates, is caused by enzootic nasal tumor virus 2 (ENTV-2). ENTV-2 belongs to the genus Betaretrovirus and has extended its distribution globally with a high prevalence; however, the genetic diversity and genotypic distribution for ENTV-2 have not been analyzed systematically due to the limited availability of sequence data. In this study, an infection by ENTV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in Chongqing in July 2018, and the complete sequence of one strain (CQ1) was determined. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a high degree of genetic heterogeneity among ENTV-2 sequences, with the existence of two main lineages. Lineage 1 and 2 were composed of ENTV-2 from China and the UK, respectively. Although CQ1 was closely related to recent ENTV-2 strains collected in the neighboring provinces of Chongqing (Shaanxi and Sichuan), it formed a separate sublineage of lineage 1 (sublineage 1.3). This report will enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of ENTV-2 in China.},

abstract = {Background: Recently there has been a growing interest in the potential for host transcriptomic analysis to augment the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Methods: We compared nasal and blood samples for evaluation of the host transcriptomic response in children with acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, symptomatic non-RSV respiratory virus infection, asymptomatic rhinovirus infection, and virus-negative asymptomatic controls. We used nested leave-one-pair-out cross-validation and supervised principal components analysis to define small sets of genes whose expression patterns accurately classified subjects. We validated gene classification scores using an external data set. Results: Despite lower quality of nasal RNA, the number of genes detected by microarray in each sample type was equivalent. Nasal gene expression signal derived mainly from epithelial cells but also included a variable leukocyte contribution. The number of genes with increased expression in virus-infected children was comparable in nasal and blood samples, while nasal samples also had decreased expression of many genes associated with ciliary function and assembly. Nasal gene expression signatures were as good or better for discriminating between symptomatic, asymptomatic, and uninfected children. Conclsusions: Our results support the use of nasal samples to augment pathogen-based tests to diagnose viral respiratory infection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There are no approved vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and consensus on methods to assess RSV vaccine efficacy has not been established. In this study of an adjuvanted RSV vaccine, we evaluated an RSV disease endpoint using a patient-reported outcome instrument (the inFLUenza Patient-Reported Outcome instrument [FLU-PRO]) and molecular testing for virologic confirmation. METHODS: In a randomized, blinded efficacy study (NCT02508194), 1900 adult participants aged ≥60 years who had any respiratory symptom lasting ≥24 hours recorded symptoms in a FLU-PRO-based workbook for 21 days, self-collected nasal swabs on illness days 2 to 4, and had a site-collected swab obtained on (approximately) day 4. The endpoint, acute RSV-associated respiratory illness (ARA-RI), required specific symptoms with virologic confirmation. RESULTS: The FLU-PRO demonstrated reliability, ability to detect change, and validity and had high participant adherence and acceptable patient burden in the setting of an RSV prevention trial. The ARA-RI endpoint definition captured all 33 virologically confirmed RSV illnesses for which symptom data were provided, and in 32 of these, at least 1 lower respiratory symptom was reported. Sensitivity analysis with an endpoint requiring ≥2 lower respiratory symptoms captured greater symptom severity but fewer cases. Results of self- and site-collected swabs were highly correlated. Self-swabbing detected 9 additional cases that would have been missed by site swabbing only. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the reliability and validity of the ARA-RI definition and of the FLU-PRO for use in RSV studies. Self-swabbing improved RSV detection.},

The current study was designed to explore the allergen-specific immune tolerance effects of Der p1-modified dendritic cells (DCs) through IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 on an allergic rhinitis (AR) mouse model. Methods: A lentivirus was modified to express Derp1. Then, immature DCs from mice were infected with this modified lentivirus to generate a lenti-Derp1-GFP DCs. 24 mice were random divided into four groups (n = 6 each), AR mouse were sensitized by Derp1 allergens and treated with lenti-GFP DCs (GFP-DC/AR group), or lenti-Derp1-GFP DCs (Der p1-DC/AR group) and dexamethasone (Dex/AR group), mice in the control group were treated with PBS instead of Der p1 then also intraperitoneally injected with 5 × 10 6 lenti-GFP DCs/mouse. AR symptoms expressed by each mouse were recorded. The proportions of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + regulatory T cells among CD4 + T cells in the peripheral blood, and mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 were measured. Results: DCs infected with lenti-Derp1-GFP stimulated the maturation of DCs. Compared with the GFP-DC/AR group, mice in the Der p1-DC/AR group showed an ameliorated allergic response, a significant decrease in the levels of serum IgE, IgG1, and histamine, and a decrease in the expression of IL-4 and IL-13 mRNA and protein in the nasal mucosa. The expression of IL-10 increased in the Der p1-DC/AR group to a level similar to that observed in the Dex/AR group. Conclusions: These results indicate that Der p1-modified DCs have therapeutic potential for AR via downregulation of IL-4 and IL-13, and upregulation of IL-10.},

However, it is unclear whether there has been cryptic transmission before these early officially confirmed cases, we therefore retrospectively screened for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 1271 nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as the prevalence of IgM, IgG, and total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 357 matched serum samples collected from hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness between 1 December 2018 and 31 March 2020 in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The onset date of the earliest COVID-19 case in this study was 25 January 2020. Before this time point, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 was not observed, which limited the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has already spread among the population before the large-scale outbreak. Additionally, among 6662 patients with influenza-like illness from 1 December 2017 to 31 March 2020, the overall number of patients positive for influenza and other respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 period decreased significantly when compared with that in the same period of the last two years, reflecting that public health interventions can effectively control the spread of common respiratory viruses.},

abstract = {Background: Influenza B virus is a main causative pathogen of annual influenza epidemics, however, research on influenza B virus in general lags behind that on influenza A viruses, one of the important reasons is studies on influenza B viruses in animal models are limited. Here we investigated the tree shrew as a potential model for influenza B virus studies. Methods: Tree shrews and ferrets were inoculated with either a Yamagata or Victoria lineage influenza B virus. Symptoms including nasal discharge and weight loss were observed. Nasal wash and respiratory tissues were collected at 2, 4 and 6 days post inoculation (DPI). Viral titers were measured in nasal washes and tissues were used for pathological examination and extraction of mRNA for measurement of cytokine expression. Results: Clinical signs and pathological changes were also evident in the respiratory tracts of tree shrews and ferrets. Although nasal symptoms including sneezing and rhinorrhea were evident in ferrets infected with influenza B virus, tree shrews showed no significant respiratory symptoms, only milder nasal secretions appeared. Weight loss was observed in tree shrews but not ferrets. V0215 and Y12 replicated in all three animal (ferrets, tree shrews and mice) models with peak titers evident on 2DPI. There were no significant differences in peak viral titers in ferrets and tree shrews inoculated with Y12 at 2 and 4DPI, but viral titers were detected at 6DPI in tree shrews. Tree shrews infected with influenza B virus showed similar seroconversion and respiratory tract pathology to ferrets. Elevated levels of cytokines were detected in the tissues isolated from the respiratory tract after infection with either V0215 or Y12 compared to the levels in the uninfected control in both animals. Overall, the tree shrew was sensitive to infection and disease by influenza B virus. Conclusion: The tree shrew to be a promising model for influenza B virus research.},

abstract = { Ferrets represent an invaluable animal model to study influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission. To further characterize this model, we developed a differentiated primary ferret nasal epithelial cell (FNEC) culture model for investigation of influenza A virus infection and virus-host interactions. This well-differentiated culture consists of various cell types, a mucociliary clearance system, and tight junctions, representing the nasal ciliated pseudostratified respiratory epithelium. Both $\alpha$2,6-linked and $\alpha$2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) receptors, which preferentially bind the hemagglutinin (HA) of human and avian influenza viruses, respectively, were detected on the apical surface of the culture with different cellular tropisms. In accordance with the distribution of SA receptors, we observed that a pre-2009 seasonal A(H1N1) virus infected both ciliated and nonciliated cells, whereas a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus primarily infected nonciliated cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that virions were released from or associated with the apical membranes of ciliated, nonciliated, and mucin-secretory goblet cells. Upon infection, the HPAI A(H5N1) virus replicated to titers higher than those of the human A(H1N1) virus at 37°C; however, replication of the A(H5N1) virus was significantly attenuated at 33°C. Furthermore, we found that infection with the A(H5N1) virus induced higher expression levels of immune mediator genes and resulted in more cell damage/loss than with the human A(H1N1) virus. This primary differentiated FNEC culture model, recapitulating the structure of the nasal epithelium, provides a useful model to bridge in vivo and in vitro studies of cellular tropism, infectivity, and pathogenesis of influenza viruses during the initial stages of infection.  IMPORTANCE Although ferrets serve as an important model of influenza virus infection, much remains unknown about virus-host interactions in this species at the cellular level. The development of differentiated primary cultures of ferret nasal epithelial cells is an important step toward understanding cellular tropism and the mechanisms of influenza virus infection and replication in the airway milieu of this model. Using lectin staining and microscopy techniques, we characterized the sialic acid receptor distribution and the cellular composition of the culture model. We then evaluated the replication of and immune response to human and avian influenza viruses at relevant physiological temperatures. Our findings offer significant insight into this first line of defense against influenza virus infection and provide a model for the evaluation of emerging influenza viruses in a well-controlled in vitro environmental setting. },

abstract = {Natural transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been difficult to observe. However, recent work using the mouse model of murine (M)CMV demonstrated that MCMV initially infects the nasal mucosa after transmission from mothers to pups. We found that intranasal (i.n.) inoculation of C57BL/6J mice resulted in reliable recovery of replicating virus from the nasal mucosa as assessed by plaque assay. After i.n. inoculation, CD8+ T-cell priming occurred in the mandibular, deep-cervical, and mediastinal lymph nodes within 3 days of infection. Although i.n. infection induced “memory inflation” of T cells specific for the M38316–323 epitope, there were no detectable CD8+ T-cell responses against the late-appearing IE3416–423 epitope, which contrasts with intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection. MCMV-specific T cells migrated into the nasal mucosa where they developed a tissue-resident memory (TRM) phenotype and this could occur independently of local virus infection or antigen. Strikingly however, virus replication was poorly controlled in the nasal mucosa and MCMV was detectable by plaque assay for at least 4 months after primary infection, making the nasal mucosa a second site for MCMV persistence. Unlike in the salivary glands, the persistence of MCMV in the nasal mucosa was not modulated by IL-10. Taken together, our data characterize the development of local and systemic T-cell responses after intranasal infection by MCMV and define the nasal mucosa, a natural site of viral entry, as a novel site of viral persistence.},

abstract = {Background: Increasing number of hospitalized children with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is co-detected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp). The clinical characteristics and impact of Mp co-detected with other bacterial and/or viral pathogens remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection. Methods: A total of 4148 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited from January to December 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University. A variety of respiratory viruses, bacteria and Mp were detected using multiple modalities. The demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among the 110 CAP children with Mp positive, 42 (38.18{\%}) of them were co-detected with at least one other pathogen. Co-detection was more common among children aged ≤3 years. No significant differences were found in most clinical symptoms, complications, underlying conditions and disease severity parameters among various etiological groups, with the following exceptions. First, prolonged duration of fever, lack of appetite and runny nose were more prevalent among CAP children with Mp-virus co-detection. Second, Mp-virus (excluding HRV) co-detected patients were more likely to present with prolonged duration of fever. Third, patients co-detected with Mp-bacteria were more likely to have abnormal blood gases. Additionally, CAP children with Mp-HRV co-detection were significantly more likely to report severe runny nose compared to those with Mp mono-detection. Conclusion: Mp co-detection with viral and/or bacterial pathogens is common in clinical practice. However, there are no apparent differences between Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detections in terms of clinical features and disease severity.},

abstract = {To investigate the genetic variation and molecular epidemiology characteristics of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (HRSV) in Guizhou Province, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital, from December 2017 to March 2018, and inoculated to Hep-2 cells to isolate HRSV. Cells that showed cytopathic effect (CPE) were then confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and reverse transcription. The sequence of the PCR products was determined for HRSV isolates, and the genetic variation was analyzed. Out of 196 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, HRSV were isolated in 39. The second hypervariable region at the 3′ terminal of glycoprotein gene (HVR2) sequence analysis showed that subgroup A was dominant. Seventy-nine percent of the isolates belonged to subgroup A, ON1 genotype, and 21 {\%} belonged to subgroup B, BA9 genotype, which indicates that the dominant HRSV circulating in Guizhou Province was subgroup A, genotype ON1, co-circulating with a less prevalent subgroup B, genotype BA9.},

abstract = {Recently, COVID-19 has spread in more than 100 countries and regions around the world, raising grave global concerns. COVID-19 transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and close contacts, causing cluster infections. The symptoms are dominantly fever, fatigue, and dry cough, and can be complicated with tiredness, sore throat, and headache. A few patients have symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, and diarrhea. The severe disease can progress rapidly into the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Next-generation sequencing (NGS) are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Chest imaging is used for cross validation. Chest CT is highly recommended as the preferred imaging diagnosis method for COVID-19 due to its high density and high spatial resolution. The common CT manifestation of COVID-19 includes multiple segmental ground glass opacities (GGOs) distributed dominantly in extrapulmonary/subpleural zones and along bronchovascular bundles with crazy paving sign and interlobular septal thickening and consolidation. Pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rarely seen. In CT imaging, COVID-19 manifests differently in its various stages including the early stage, the progression (consolidation) stage, and the absorption stage. In its early stage, it manifests as scattered flaky GGOs in various sizes, dominated by peripheral pulmonary zone/subpleural distributions. In the progression state, GGOs increase in number and/or size, and lung consolidations may become visible. The main manifestation in the absorption stage is interstitial change of both lungs, such as fibrous cords and reticular opacities. Differentiation between COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias are also analyzed. Thus, CT examination can help reduce false negatives of nucleic acid tests.},

However, clinical characteristics of HPIV coinfection with other pathogens were unclear. This study aimed to investigate the viral and atypical bacterial etiology of LRTI in children and compare the clinical characteristics of HPIV single infection with those of coinfection. Methods: This study included 1335 patients, aged between 1 to 71 months, diagnosed with LRTI in Yuying Children's Hospital, Zhejiang, China, from December 2013 to June 2015. Nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, and respiratory pathogens were detected using Multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The clinical data of patients were collected and analyzed. Results: At least 1 pathogen was detected in 1181/1335 (88.5{\%}) patients. The pathogens identified most frequently were respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, HPIV, adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus. The coinfection rate was 24.8{\%}. HPIV coinfection with other viruses was more associated with running nose, shortness of breath, and oxygen support compared with HPIV single infection. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more related to running nose, moist rales, and longer hospital duration compared with HPIV single infection, and also to longer hospital duration compared with coinfection with other viruses. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that viral infections were highly associated with LRTI and the rate of coinfection was high. HPIV single infection was milder than coinfection with other viruses. Moreover, HPIV coinfection with atypical bacteria was more serious than HPIV single infection and coinfection with other viruses.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the CT features and clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: A total of 9 COVID-19 infected pediatric patients were included in this study. Clinical history, laboratory examination, and detailed CT imaging features were analyzed. All patients underwent the first CT scanning on the same day of being diagnosed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). A low-dose CT scan was performed during follow-up. RESULTS: All the child patients had positive results. Four patients had cough and one patient had fever. One patient presented both cough and fever. Two children presented other symptoms like sore throat and stuffy nose. One child showed no clinical symptom. Five patients had positive initial CT findings with subtle lesions like ground-glass opacity (GGO) or spot-like mixed consolidation. Three patients were reported with negative results in the initial and follow-up CT examination. One patient was reported with initial negative CT findings but turning positive during the first follow-up. All patients had absorbed lesions on follow-up CT images after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric COVID-19 patients have certain imaging and clinical features as well as disease prognosis. Children with COVID-19 tend to have normal or subtle CT findings and relatively better outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: A pituitary adenoma patient who underwent surgery in our department was diagnosed with COVID-19 and 14 medical staff were confirmed infected later. This case has been cited several times but without accuracy or entirety, we feel obligated to report it and share our thoughts on the epidemic among medical staff and performing endonasal endoscopic surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient developed a fever 3 d post endonasal endoscopic surgery during which cerebrospinal leak occurred, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection later. Several medical staff outside the operating room were diagnosed with COVID-19, while the ones who participated in the surgery were not. CONCLUSION: The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a clich{\'{e}} in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate. The COVID-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.},

abstract = {There is pressing urgency to understand the pathogenesis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus clade 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the disease COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry. The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown. Here, we leverage human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets across health and disease to uncover putative targets of SARS-CoV-2 among tissue-resident cell subsets. We identify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells within lung type II pneumocytes, ileal absorptive enterocytes, and nasal goblet secretory cells. Strikingly, we discovered that ACE2 is a human interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) in vitro using airway epithelial cells and extend our findings to in vivo viral infections. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could exploit species-specific interferon-driven upregulation of ACE2, a tissue-protective mediator during lung injury, to enhance infection.},

This narrative review evaluates the literature regarding the accuracy of these tests, and makes recommendations based on this literature. In brief, a negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab test is insufficient to rule out COVID-19.
