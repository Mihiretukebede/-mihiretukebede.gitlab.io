AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which began in December 2019, 
      is still ongoing in Korea, with >9,000 confirmed cases as of March 25, 2020. 
      COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR is currently the most reliable 
      diagnostic method for COVID-19 around the world. Korean Society for Laboratory 
      Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control propose guidelines 
      for diagnosing COVID-19 in clinical laboratories in Korea. These guidelines are 
      based on other related domestic and international guidelines, as well as expert 
      opinions and include the selection of test subjects, selection of specimens, 
      diagnostic methods, interpretation of test results, and biosafety.

AB  - Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their 
      bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li 
      was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course 
      of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of 
      coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low 
      molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor 
      Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on 
      the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and 
      repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of 
      clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu 
      suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical 
      compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical 
      management of the COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 
      patients. For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory 
      supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. 
      The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique 
      characteristics of each patient.

AB  - Circulating in China and 158 other countries and areas, the ongoing COVID-19 
      outbreak has caused devastating mortality and posed a great threat to public health. 
      However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments 
      has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this 
      fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory 
      response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing 
      of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal 
      distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, 
      and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine 
      release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, 
      SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes 
      may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 
      patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory 
      medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with droplets and contact as the 
      main means of transmission. Since the first case appeared in Wuhan, China, in 
      December 2019, the outbreak has gradually spread nationwide. Up to now, according to 
      official data released by the Chinese health commission, the number of newly 
      diagnosed patients has been declining, and the epidemic is gradually being 
      controlled. Although most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis after 
      infection, some patients developed severe and die from multiple organ complications. 
      The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans remains unclear. Immune function 
      is a strong defense against invasive pathogens and there is currently no specific 
      antiviral drug against the virus. This article reviews the immunological changes of 
      coronaviruses like SARS, MERS and other viral pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV-2. 
      Combined with the published literature, the potential pathogenesis of COVID-19 is 
      inferred, and the treatment recommendations for giving high-doses intravenous 
      immunoglobulin and low-molecular-weight heparin anticoagulant therapy to severe type 
      patients are proposed.

AB  - The three unprecedented outbreaks of emerging human coronavirus (HCoV) infections at 
      the beginning of the twenty-first century have highlighted the necessity for readily 
      available, accurate and fast diagnostic testing methods. The laboratory diagnostic 
      methods for human coronavirus infections have evolved substantially, with the 
      development of novel assays as well as the availability of updated tests for 
      emerging ones. Newer laboratory methods are fast, highly sensitive and specific, and 
      are gradually replacing the conventional gold standards. This presentation reviews 
      the current laboratory methods available for testing coronaviruses by focusing on 
      the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak going on in Wuhan. Viral pneumonias 
      typically do not result in the production of purulent sputum. Thus, a nasopharyngeal 
      swab is usually the collection method used to obtain a specimen for testing. 
      Nasopharyngeal specimens may miss some infections; a deeper specimen may need to be 
      obtained by bronchoscopy. Alternatively, repeated testing can be used because over 
      time, the likelihood of the SARS-CoV-2 being present in the nasopharynx increases. 
      Several integrated, random-access, point-of-care molecular devices are currently 
      under development for fast and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These 
      assays are simple, fast and safe and can be used in the local hospitals and clinics 
      bearing the burden of identifying and treating patients.

AB  - Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary 
      between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was 
      identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus 
      represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus 
      is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 
      the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World 
      Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic 
      in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the 
      incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 
      laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific 
      medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and 
      pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat 
      the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge 
      about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an 
      antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now 
      approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and 
      hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were 
      recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for 
      treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under 
      investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for 
      COVID-19. The first COVID-19 vaccine is not expected to be ready for clinical trials 
      before the end of the year.

AB  - The dysfunction of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been observed in 
      coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) patients, but whether RAS inhibitors, such 
      as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 
      receptor blockers (ARBs), are associated with clinical outcomes remains unknown. 
      COVID-19 patients with hypertension were enrolled to evaluate the effect of RAS 
      inhibitors. We observed that patients receiving ACEI or ARB therapy had a lower rate 
      of severe diseases and a trend toward a lower level of IL-6 in peripheral blood. In 
      addition, ACEI or ARB therapy increased CD3 and CD8 T cell counts in peripheral 
      blood and decreased the peak viral load compared to other antihypertensive drugs. 
      This evidence supports the benefit of using ACEIs or ARBs to potentially contribute 
      to the improvement of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

AB  - In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, 
      Hubei, and spread rapidly to China. The lung injury and repair caused by COVID-19 
      has many similarities with the onset and progression of interstitial lung disease 
      (ILD) . Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and some types of 
      new-onset ILD or other causes leading to acute exacerbation of ILD. Clinicians need 
      to comprehensively analyze the epidemic history, disease onset characteristics, 
      clinical manifestations, image characteristics, serological andpathogenic 
      microorganism test results to confirm diagnosis. Because of this, the article will 
      discuss the issues related to the differential diagnosis and management of COVID-19 
      and ILD, and try to provide reasonable suggestions.

AB  - On 31 December 2019, a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and caused the outbreak of the Coronavirus 
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, computed tomography (CT) findings have been 
      recommended as major evidence for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hubei, 
      China. This review focuses on the imaging characteristics and changes throughout the 
      disease course in patients with COVID-19 in order to provide some help for 
      clinicians. Typical CT findings included bilateral ground-glass opacity, pulmonary 
      consolidation, and prominent distribution in the posterior and peripheral parts of 
      the lungs. This review also provides a comparison between COVID-19 and other 
      diseases that have similar CT findings. Since most patients with COVID-19 infection 
      share typical imaging features, radiological examinations have an irreplaceable role 
      in screening, diagnosis and monitoring treatment effects in clinical practice.

AB  - The emerging COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection poses severe challenges to 
      global public health. Serum antibody testing is becoming one of the critical methods 
      for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. We investigated IgM and IgG responses 
      against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein after symptom onset in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. 130 blood samples from 38 COVID-19 
      patients were collected. The levels of IgM and IgG specific to N and S protein were 
      detected by ELISA. A series of blood samples were collected along the disease course 
      from the same patient, including 11 ICU patients and 27 non-ICU patients for 
      longitudinal analysis. N and S specific IgM and IgG (N-IgM, N-IgG, S-IgM, S-IgG) in 
      non-ICU patients increased after symptom onset. N-IgM and S-IgM in some non-ICU 
      patients reached a peak in the second week, while N-IgG and S-IgG continued to 
      increase in the third week. The combined detection of N and S specific IgM and IgG 
      could identify up to 75% of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in the first week. S-IgG 
      was significantly higher in non-ICU patients than in ICU patients in the third week. 
      In contrast, N-IgG was significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU 
      patients. The increase of S-IgG positively correlated with the decrease of 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-ICU patients. N and S specific IgM and IgG increased 
      gradually after symptom onset and can be used for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Analysis of the dynamics of S-IgG may help to predict prognosis.

AB  - Pseudoviruses are useful virological tools because of their safety and versatility, 
      especially for emerging and re-emerging viruses. Due to its high pathogenicity and 
      infectivity and the lack of effective vaccines and therapeutics, live SARS-CoV-2 has 
      to be handled under biosafety level 3 conditions, which has hindered the development 
      of vaccines and therapeutics. Based on a VSV pseudovirus production system, a 
      pseudovirus-based neutralization assay has been developed for evaluating 
      neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in biosafety level 2 facilities. The key 
      parameters for this assay were optimized, including cell types, cell numbers, virus 
      inoculum. When tested against the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, SARS-CoV-2 convalescent 
      patient sera showed high neutralizing potency, which underscore its potential as 
      therapeutics. The limit of detection for this assay was determined as 22.1 and 43.2 
      for human and mouse serum samples respectively using a panel of 120 negative 
      samples. The cutoff values were set as 30 and 50 for human and mouse serum samples, 
      respectively. This assay showed relatively low coefficient of variations with 15.9% 
      and 16.2% for the intra- and inter-assay analyses respectively. Taken together, we 
      established a robust pseudovirus-based neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 and are 
      glad to share pseudoviruses and related protocols with the developers of vaccines or 
      therapeutics to fight against this lethal virus.

AB  - Effective strategy to mitigate the ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus 
      (COVID-19) require a comprehensive understanding of humoral responses against severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the emerging virus causing 
      COVID-19. The dynamic profile of viral replication and shedding along with viral 
      antigen specific antibody responses among COVID-19 patients started to be reported 
      but there is no consensus on their patterns. Here, we conducted a serial 
      investigation on 21 individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in two medical centres from 
      Jiangsu Province, including 11 non-severe COVID-19 patients, and 5 severe COVID-19 
      patients and 5 asymptomatic carriers based on nucleic acid test and clinical 
      symptoms. The longitudinal swab samples and sera were collected from these people 
      for viral RNA testing and antibody responses, respectively. Our data revealed 
      different pattern of seroconversion among these groups. All 11 non-severe COVID-19 
      patients and 5 severe COVID-19 patients were seroconverted during hospitalization or 
      follow-up period, suggesting that serological testing is a complementary assay to 
      nucleic acid test for those symptomatic COVID-19 patients. Of note, immediate 
      antibody responses were identified among severe cases, compared to non-severe cases. 
      On the other hand, only one were seroconverted for asymptomatic carriers. The 
      SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses were well-maintained during the observation 
      period. Such information is of immediate relevance and would assist COVID-19 
      clinical diagnosis, prognosis and vaccine design.

AB  - SUMMARYIn recent decades, several new diseases have emerged in different 
      geographical areas, with pathogens including Ebola virus, Zika virus, Nipah virus, 
      and coronaviruses (CoVs). Recently, a new type of viral infection emerged in Wuhan 
      City, China, and initial genomic sequencing data of this virus do not match with 
      previously sequenced CoVs, suggesting a novel CoV strain (2019-nCoV), which has now 
      been termed severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected to originate from an animal host 
      (zoonotic origin) followed by human-to-human transmission, the possibility of other 
      routes should not be ruled out. Compared to diseases caused by previously known 
      human CoVs, COVID-19 shows less severe pathogenesis but higher transmission 
      competence, as is evident from the continuously increasing number of confirmed cases 
      globally. Compared to other emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, avian H7N9, 
      SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2 
      has shown relatively low pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility. Codon usage 
      studies suggest that this novel virus has been transferred from an animal source, 
      such as bats. Early diagnosis by real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing has 
      facilitated the identification of the pathogen at an early stage. Since no antiviral 
      drug or vaccine exists to treat or prevent SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic 
      strategies that are currently being evaluated predominantly stem from previous 
      experience with treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. In 
      this review, we address epidemiological, diagnostic, clinical, and therapeutic 
      aspects, including perspectives of vaccines and preventive measures that have 
      already been globally recommended to counter this pandemic virus.

AB  - Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic 
      infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian. The 
      scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by 
      Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade's first CoV, named 
      2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of 
      International Concern' on January 30(th), 2020 by the World Health Organization 
      (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death 
      outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been 
      noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as 
      the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable 
      source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of 
      the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal 
      reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. 
      The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better 
      diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to 
      newer areas.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the different clinical characteristics between children 
      and their families infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. 
      Clinical data from nine children and their 14 families were collected, including 
      general status, clinical, laboratory test, and imaging characteristics. All the 
      children were detected positive result after their families onset. Three children 
      had fever (22.2%) or cough (11.2%) symptoms and six (66.7%) children had no symptom. 
      Among the 14 adult patients, the major symptoms included fever (57.1%), cough 
      (35.7%), chest tightness/pain (21.4%), fatigue (21.4%) and sore throat (7.1%). 
      Nearly 70% of the patients had normal (71.4%) or decreased (28.6%) white blood cell 
      counts, and 50% (7/14) had lymphocytopenia. There were 10 adults (71.4%) showed 
      abnormal imaging. The main manifestations were pulmonary consolidation (70%), 
      nodular shadow (50%), and ground glass opacity (50%). Five discharged children were 
      admitted again because their stool showed positive result in SARS-CoV-2 PCR. 
      COVID-19 in children is mainly caused by family transmission, and their symptoms are 
      mild and prognosis is better than adult. However, their PCR result in stool showed 
      longer time than their families. Because of the mild or asymptomatic clinical 
      process, it is difficult to recognize early for pediatrician and public health 
      staff.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic (Coronavirus disease 2019) continues to expose countless 
      unanticipated problems at all levels of the world's complex, interconnected society 
      - global domino effects involving public health and safety, accessible health care, 
      food security, stability of economies and financial institutions, and even the 
      viability of democracies. These problems pose immense challenges that can 
      voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, 
      and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most 
      daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and 
      magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or 
      therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify 
      infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the 
      large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, 
      this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large 
      populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental 
      scientists over the last 20Â years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology - WBE) holds the 
      potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also 
      minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that 
      stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such 
      as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed 
      for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it 
      could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire 
      community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists 
      or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments 
      should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a 
      standardized WBE methodology - one that could be deployed within nationalized 
      monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.

AB  - At the end of December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appeared in Wuhan 
      city, China. As of April 15, 2020, >1.9 million COVID-19 cases were confirmed 
      worldwide, including >120,000 deaths. There is an urgent need to monitor and predict 
      COVID-19 prevalence to control this spread more effectively. Time series models are 
      significant in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and taking the 
      necessary measures to respond to this crisis. In this study, Auto-Regressive 
      Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the 
      epidemiological trend of COVID-19 prevalence of Italy, Spain, and France, the most 
      affected countries of Europe. The prevalence data of COVID-19 from 21 February 2020 
      to 15 April 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization website. Several 
      ARIMA models were formulated with different ARIMA parameters. ARIMA (0,2,1), ARIMA 
      (1,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) models with the lowest MAPE values (4.7520, 5.8486, and 
      5.6335) were selected as the best models for Italy, Spain, and France, respectively. 
      This study shows that ARIMA models are suitable for predicting the prevalence of 
      COVID-19 in the future. The results of the analysis can shed light on understanding 
      the trends of the outbreak and give an idea of the epidemiological stage of these 
      regions. Besides, the prediction of COVID-19 prevalence trends of Italy, Spain, and 
      France can help take precautions and policy formulation for this epidemic in other 
      countries.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread over 210 countries and territories 
      beyond China shortly. On February 29, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      denoted it in a high-risk category, and on March 11, 2020, this virus was designated 
      pandemic, after its declaration being a Public Health International Emergency on 
      January 30, 2020. World over high efforts are being made to counter and contain this 
      virus. The COVID-19 outbreak once again proves the potential of the animal-human 
      interface to act as the primary source of emerging zoonotic diseases. Even though 
      the circumstantial evidence suggests the possibility of an initial zoonotic 
      emergence, it is too early to confirm the role of intermediate hosts such as snakes, 
      pangolins, turtles, and other wild animals in the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in addition 
      to bats, the natural hosts of multiple coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 
      The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited 
      to retort this virus. Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to 
      implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and 
      monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies. 
      Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for 
      its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive 
      barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This review discusses in 
      brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, 
      the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control 
      strategies based on One-health approaches.

PG  - 1372-1378
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1775499 [doi]
AB  - Background: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak of 
      coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as pandemic and public 
      health emergency that infected more than 5 million people worldwide at the time of 
      writing this protocol. Strong evidence for the burden, admission, and outcome of 
      COVID-19 has not been published in Africa. Therefore, this protocol will be served 
      as a guideline to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the burden, 
      admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa. Methods: Published and unpublished 
      studies on the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 in Africa and written in 
      any language will be included. Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, 
      EMBASE, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, 
      Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from December 2019 to May 2020 will 
      be searched. Two independent reviewers will select, screen, extract data, and assess 
      the risk of bias. The proportion will be measured using a random-effects model. 
      Subgroup analysis will be conducted to manage hetrogeinity. The presence of 
      publication bias will be assessed using Egger's test and visual inspection of the 
      funnel plots. This systematic and meta-analysis review protocol will be reported per 
      the PRISMA-P guidelines. Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis 
      protocol will be expected to quantify the burden, admission, and outcome of COVID-19 
      in Africa. Systematic review registration: This protocol was submitted for 
      registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
      (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number: 
      CRD42020179321(https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO).

TI  - The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health.
PG  - 841-852
LID - 10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3 [doi]
AB  - The purposes of this study was to assess the youth mental health after the 
      coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) occurred in China two weeks later, and to 
      investigate factors of mental health among youth groups. A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth 
      enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of 
      COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian 
      Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and 
      univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth 
      mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% 
      the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the 
      sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate 
      logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to 
      being less educated (ORâ=â8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee 
      (ORâ=â2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptomÂ (ORâ=â1.05, 
      95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping stylesÂ (ORâ=â1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07). 
      Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to 
      have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious 
      diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. 
      Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for 
      youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and 
      occupation of the youth during the interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report neurological manifestations seen in patients hospitalized with 
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a large academic medical center in Chicago, 
      Illinois. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data records of 50 patients with 
      COVID-19 who were evaluated by the neurology services from March 1, 2020 - April 30, 
      2020. Patients were categorized into 2 groups based on timing of developing 
      neurological manifestations: the "Neuro first" group had neurological manifestations 
      upon initial assessment, and the "COVID first" group developed neurological symptoms 
      greater than 24Â h after hospitalization. The demographics, comorbidities, disease 
      severity and neurological symptoms and diagnoses of both groups were analyzed. 
      Statistical analysis was performed to compare the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 50 
      patients (48% African American and 24% Latino) were included in the analysis. Most 
      common neurological manifestations observed were encephalopathy (nÂ =Â 30), 
      cerebrovascular disease (nÂ =Â 20), cognitive impairment (nÂ =Â 13), seizures (nÂ =Â 13), 
      hypoxic brain injury (nÂ =Â 7), dysgeusia (nÂ =Â 5), and extraocular movement 
      abnormalities (nÂ =Â 5). The "COVID-19 first" group had more evidence of physiologic 
      disturbances on arrival with a more severe/critical disease course (83.3% vs 53.8%, 
      p 0.025). CONCLUSION: Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 are highly variable and 
      can occur prior to the diagnosis of or as a complication of the viral infection. 
      Despite similar baseline comorbidities and demographics, the COVID-19 patients who 
      developed neurologic symptoms later in hospitalization had more severe disease 
      courses. Differently from previous studies, we noted a high percentage of African 
      American and Latino individuals in both groups.

AB  - Patients with COVID-19 who require ICU admission might have the cytokine storm. It 
      is a state of out-of-control release of a variety of inflammatory cytokines. The 
      molecular mechanism of the cytokine storm has not been explored extensively yet. The 
      attachment of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 
      (ACE2), as its cellular receptor, triggers complex molecular events that leads to 
      hyperinflammation. Four molecular axes that may be involved in SARS-CoV-2 driven 
      inflammatory cytokine overproduction are addressed in this work. The virus-mediated 
      down-regulation of ACE2 causes a burst of inflammatory cytokine release through 
      dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ACE/angiotensin II/AT1R 
      axis), attenuation of Mas receptor (ACE2/MasR axis), increased activation of 
      [des-Arg9]-bradykinin (ACE2/bradykinin B1R/DABK axis), and activation of the 
      complement system including C5a and C5b-9 components. The molecular clarification of 
      these axes will elucidate an array of therapeutic strategies to confront the 
      cytokine storm in order to prevent and treat COVID-19 associated acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome.

TI  - The possible pathophysiology mechanism of cytokine storm in elderly adults with 
      COVID-19 infection: the contribution of "inflame-aging".
PG  - 825-839
LID - 10.1007/s00011-020-01372-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS), which is emerged in Wuhan, and recently become worldwide pandemic. 
      Strangely, ample evidences have been shown that the severity of COVID-19 infections 
      varies widely from children (asymptomatic), adults (mild infection), as well as 
      elderly adults (deadly critical). It has proven that COVID-19 infection in some 
      elderly critical adults leads to a cytokine storm, which is characterized by severe 
      systemic elevation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Then, a cytokine storm can 
      induce edematous, ARDS, pneumonia, as well as multiple organ failure in aged 
      patients. It is far from clear till now why cytokine storm induces in only COVID-19 
      elderly patients, and not in young patients. However, it seems that aging is 
      associated with mild elevated levels of local and systemic pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines, which is characterized by "inflamm-aging". It is highly likely that 
      "inflamm-aging" is correlated to increased risk of a cytokine storm in some critical 
      elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A systematic search in the 
      literature was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of 
      Science, as well as Google Scholar pre-print database using all available MeSH terms 
      for COVID-19, Coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, senescent cell, cytokine storm, 
      inflame-aging, ACE2 receptor, autophagy, and Vitamin D. Electronic database searches 
      combined and duplicates were removed. RESULTS: The aim of the present review was to 
      summarize experimental data and clinical observations that linked the 
      pathophysiology mechanisms of "inflamm-aging", mild-grade inflammation, and cytokine 
      storm in some elderly adults with severe COVID-19 infection.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a havoc situation across the globe that modern 
      society has ever seen. Despite of their paramount importance, the transmission 
      routes of SARS-Cov-2 still remain debated among various sectors. Evidences compiled 
      here strongly suggest that the COVID-19 could be transmitted via air in inadequately 
      ventilated environments. Existing experimental data showed that coronavirus survival 
      was negatively impacted by ozone, high temperature and low humidity. Here, 
      regression analysis showed that the spread of SARS-Cov-2 was reduced by increasing 
      ambient ozone concentration level from 48.83 to 94.67Â Î¼g/m(3) (p-valueÂ =Â 0.039) and 
      decreasing relative humidity from 23.33 to 82.67% (p-valueÂ =Â 0.002) and temperature 
      from -13.17 to 19Â Â°C) (p-valueÂ =Â 0.003) observed for Chinese cities during Jan-March 
      2020. Besides using these environmental implications, social distancing and wearing 
      a mask are strongly encouraged to maximize the fight against the COVID-19 airborne 
      transmission. At no other time than now are the scientists in various disciplines 
      around the world badly needed by the society to collectively confront this 
      disastrous pandemic.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global challenge. Despite 
      intense research efforts worldwide, an effective vaccine and viable treatment 
      options have eluded investigators. Therefore, infection prevention, early viral 
      detection and identification of successful treatment protocols provide the best 
      approach in controlling disease spread. In this review, current therapeutic options, 
      preventive methods and transmission routes of COVID-19 are discussed.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an illness caused due to Severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization 
      (WHO) has declared this outbreak a global health emergency and as on April 24, 2020, 
      it has spread to 213 countries, with 25,91,015 confirmed cases and 742,855 cases 
      have been recovered from COVID-19. In this dreadful situation our team has already 
      published an article in the Science of the Total Environment, which elaborates the 
      various aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this situation, it is imperative to 
      understand the possible outcome of COVID-19 recovered patients and determine if they 
      have any other detrimental illnesses by longitudinal analysis to safeguard their 
      life in future. It is necessary to follow-up these recovered patients and performs 
      comprehensive assessments for detection and appropriate management towards their 
      psychological, physical, and social realm. This urges us to suggest that it is 
      highly important to provide counselling, moral support as well as a few recommended 
      guidelines to the recovered patients and society to restore to normalcy. 
      Epidemiological, clinical and immunological studies from COVID-19 recovered patients 
      are particularly important to understand the disease and to prepare better for 
      potential outbreaks in the future. Longitudinal studies on a larger cohort would 
      help us to understand the in-depth prognosis as well as the pathogenesis of 
      COVID-19. Also, follow-up studies will help us provide more information for the 
      development of vaccines and drugs for these kinds of pandemics in the future. Hence, 
      we recommend more studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of COVID-19 
      infection and the after-effects of it to understand the characteristics of the virus 
      and to develop the necessary precautionary measures to prevent it.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a SARS-like coronavirus of likely zoonotic origin first identified in 
      December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. The virus has since 
      spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first 
      whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have 
      been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the 
      past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to 
      its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We 
      curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of 
      genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and 
      point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting 
      this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive 
      transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates 
      a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have 
      already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged 
      independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent 
      mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced 
      non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation 
      of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and 
      one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of 
      recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of 
      particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We 
      additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the 
      alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

TI  - Kawasaki-like diseases and thrombotic coagulopathy in COVID-19: delayed 
      over-activation of the STING pathway?
PG  - 1514-1522
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1785336 [doi]
AB  - We previously made the hypothesis that STING contributes to COVID-19. The present 
      review detail new arguments for over-activation of STING pathways in COVID-19, 
      following the description of hyper-coagulability and Kawasaki-like diseases in 
      children. Indeed, Kawasaki disease is induced by overreaction of innate cells 
      following exposition to various viruses, including herpes viruses which trigger 
      STING. It predisposes to diffuse vasculitis and aneurysms, whereas STING is 
      over-expressed in arterial aneurisms. The redness at the inoculation site of 
      bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin, a specific feature of Kawasaki disease, is reproduced by 
      activation of the STING pathway, which is inhibited upstream by aspirin, intravenous 
      immunoglobulins, and Vitamin-D. SARS-CoV2 binding to ACE2 can lead to excessive 
      angiotensin II signaling, which activates the STING pathway in mice. Over-activation 
      of the STING-pathway promotes hyper-coagulability through release of interferon-Î² 
      and tissue factor by monocytes-macrophages. Aspirin and dipyridamole, besides their 
      anti-platelet activity, also reduce tissue factor procoagulant activity, and aspirin 
      inhibits the STING pathway upstream of STING. Aspirin and dipyridamole may be used, 
      in combination with drugs blocking downstream the activation of the STING pathway, 
      like inhibitors of IL-6R and JAK/STAT pathways. The risk of bleeding should be low 
      as bleeding has not been reported in severe COVID-19 patients.

TI  - Profiling serum cytokines in COVID-19 patients reveals IL-6 and IL-10 are disease 
      severity predictors.

AB  - Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, it has 
      rapidly spread across many other countries. While the majority of patients were 
      considered mild, critically ill patients involving respiratory failure and multiple 
      organ dysfunction syndrome are not uncommon, which could result death. We 
      hypothesized that cytokine storm is associated with severe outcome. We enrolled 102 
      COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Renmin Hospital (Wuhan, China). All patients 
      were classified into moderate, severe and critical groups according to their 
      symptoms. 45 control samples of healthy volunteers were also included. Inflammatory 
      cytokines and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) profiles of serum samples were analyzed by 
      specific immunoassays. Results showed that COVID-19 patients have higher serum level 
      of cytokines (TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) and CRP than control 
      individuals. Within COVID-19 patients, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels are significantly 
      higher in critical group (nâ=â17) than in moderate (nâ=â42) and severe (nâ=â43) 
      group. The levels of IL-10 is positively correlated with CRP amount (râ=â0.41, 
      Pâ<â0.01). Using univariate logistic regression analysis, IL-6 and IL-10 are found 
      to be predictive of disease severity and receiver operating curve analysis could 
      further confirm this result (AUCâ=â0.841, 0.822 respectively). Our result indicated 
      higher levels of cytokine storm is associated with more severe disease development. 
      Among them, IL-6 and IL-10 can be used as predictors for fast diagnosis of patients 
      with higher risk of disease deterioration. Given the high levels of cytokines 
      induced by SARS-CoV-2, treatment to reduce inflammation-related lung damage is 
      critical.

AB  - Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in early 2020 provides a rich data 
      source for exploring the ecological determinants of this new infection, which may be 
      of relevance as the pandemic develops.Objectives: Assessing the spread of the 
      COVID-19 across China, in relation to associations between cases and ecological 
      factors including population density, temperature, solar radiation and 
      precipitation.Methods: Open-access COVID-19 case data include 18,069 geo-located 
      cases in China during January and February 2020, which were mapped onto a 0.25Â° 
      latitude/longitude grid together with population and weather data (temperature, 
      solar radiation and precipitation). Of 15,539 grid cells, 559 (3.6%) contained at 
      least one case, and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model of 
      cell-weeks. Weather parameters were taken for the preceding week given the 
      established 5-7 day incubation period for COVID-19. The dependent variable in the 
      Poisson model was incident cases per cell-week and exposure was cell population, 
      allowing for clustering of cells over weeks, to give incidence rate ratios.Results: 
      The overall COVID-19 incidence rate in cells with confirmed cases was 0.12 per 
      1,000. There was a single confirmed case in 113/559 (20.2%) of cells, while two grid 
      cells recorded over 1,000 confirmed cases. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature 
      varied from -28.0Â°C to 30.1Â°C, minimum daily temperature from -42.4Â°C to 23.0Â°C, 
      maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm(-2) and total precipitation from 0 to 
      72.6 mm. Adjusted incidence rate ratios suggested brighter, warmer and drier 
      conditions were associated with lower incidence.Conclusion: Though not demonstrating 
      cause and effect, there were appreciable associations between weather and COVID-19 
      incidence during the epidemic in China. This does not mean the pandemic will go away 
      with summer weather but demonstrates the importance of using weather conditions in 
      understanding and forecasting the spread of COVID-19.

      was successfully isolated from urine of a COVID-19 patient. The virus isolated could 
      infect new susceptible cells and was recognized by its' own patient sera. 
      Appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid transmission from urine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The degree of myocardial injury, as reflected by troponin elevation, and 
      associated outcomes among U.S. hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 
      (COVID-19) are unknown. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the 
      degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort 
      with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to 1 of 
      5 Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York City between February 27, 2020, 
      and April 12, 2020, with troponin-I (normal valueÂ <0.03Â ng/ml) measured within 24Â h 
      of admission were included (nÂ =Â 2,736). Demographics, medical histories, admission 
      laboratory results, and outcomes were captured from the hospitals' electronic health 
      records. RESULTS: The median age was 66.4 years, with 59.6% men. Cardiovascular 
      disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart 
      failure, was more prevalent in patients with higher troponin concentrations, as were 
      hypertension and diabetes. A total of 506 (18.5%) patients died during 
      hospitalization. In all, 985 (36%) patients had elevated troponin concentrations. 
      After adjusting for disease severity and relevant clinical factors, even small 
      amounts of myocardial injury (e.g., troponin I >0.03 to 0.09Â ng/ml; nÂ =Â 455; 16.6%) 
      were significantly associated with death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.75; 95%Â CI: 1.37 
      to 2.24; pÂ <Â 0.001) while greater amounts (e.g., troponin I >0.09Â ng/dl; nÂ =Â 530; 
      19.4%) were significantly associated with higher risk (adjusted HR: 3.03; 95%Â CI: 
      2.42 to 3.80; pÂ <Â 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury is prevalent among patients 
      hospitalized with COVID-19; however, troponin concentrations were generally present 
      at low levels. Patients with CVD are more likely to have myocardial injury than 
      patients without CVD. Troponin elevation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 
      is associated with higher risk ofÂ mortality.

AB  - During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding 
      recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this 
      pandemic disease. Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of 
      infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory 
      droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. While 
      uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different 
      transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to 
      warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall 
      strategy to limit infection risk indoors. Appropriate building engineering controls 
      include sufficient and effective ventilation, possibly enhanced by particle 
      filtration and air disinfection, avoiding air recirculation and avoiding 
      overcrowding. Often, such measures can be easily implemented and without much cost, 
      but if only they are recognised as significant in contributing to infection control 
      goals. We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, 
      including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, 
      cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with 
      effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social 
      distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to 
      reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, 
      patients and the general public.

AB  - In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by 
      SARS-CoV-2, multiple diagnostic tests are required for acute disease diagnosis, 
      contact tracing, monitoring asymptomatic infection rates and assessing herd 
      immunity. While PCR remains the frontline test of choice in the acute diagnostic 
      setting, serological tests are urgently needed. Unlike PCR tests which are highly 
      specific, cross-reactivity is a major challenge for COVID-19 antibody tests 
      considering there are six other coronaviruses known to infect humans. SARS-CoV is 
      genetically related to SARS-CoV-2 sharing approximately 80% sequence identity and 
      both belong to the species SARS related coronavirus in the genus Betacoronavirus of 
      family Coronaviridae. We developed and compared the performance of four different 
      serological tests to comprehensively assess the cross-reactivity between COVID-19 
      and SARS patient sera. There is significant cross-reactivity when N protein of 
      either virus is used. The S1 or RBD regions from the spike (S) protein offers better 
      specificity. Amongst the different platforms, capture ELISA performed best. We found 
      that SARS survivors all have significant levels of antibodies remaining in their 
      blood 17 years after infection. Anti-N antibodies waned more than anti-RBD 
      antibodies, and the latter is known to play a more important role in providing 
      protective immunity.

AB  - The current pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) calls urgently for effective 
      therapies. Anti-malarial medicine chloroquine (CQ) and particularly its chemical 
      analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been recommended as promising candidate 
      therapeutics that are now under either compassionate off-label use or clinical 
      trials for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. However, there are public concerns 
      and disputes about both the safety and efficacy of CQ and HCQ for this new 
      application. Given the fact that for decades HCQ has been approved as an 
      immunomodulatory drug for the long term treatment of chronic rheumatic diseases, as 
      experienced rheumatologists, we would like to share our thoughts in this regard and 
      trigger a brainstorm among clinical care providers for exchanging their diverse 
      opinions on this urgent topic.

TI  - The emerging spectrum of cardiopulmonary pathology of the coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19): Report of 3 autopsies from Houston, Texas, and review of autopsy 
      findings from other United States cities.

AB  - This paper collates the pathological findings from initial published autopsy reports 
      on 23 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from 5 centers in the United 
      States of America, including 3 cases from Houston, Texas. Findings confirm that 
      COVID-19 is a systemic disease with major involvement of the lungs and heart. Acute 
      COVID-19 pneumonia has features of a distinctive acute interstitial pneumonia with a 
      diffuse alveolar damage component, coupled with microvascular involvement with 
      intra- and extravascular fibrin deposition and intravascular trapping of 
      neutrophils, and, frequently, with formation of microthombi in arterioles. Major 
      pulmonary thromboemboli with pulmonary infarcts and/or hemorrhage occurred in 5 of 
      the 23 patients. Two of the Houston cases had interstitial pneumonia with diffuse 
      alveolar damage pattern. One of the Houston cases had multiple bilateral segmental 
      pulmonary thromboemboli with infarcts and hemorrhages coupled with, in 
      nonhemorrhagic areas, a distinctive interstitial lymphocytic pneumonitis with 
      intra-alveolar fibrin deposits and no hyaline membranes, possibly representing a 
      transition form to acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia. Multifocal acute injury 
      of cardiac myocytes was frequently observed. Lymphocytic myocarditis was reported in 
      1 case. In addition to major pulmonary pathology, the 3 Houston cases had evidence 
      of lymphocytic pericarditis, multifocal acute injury of cardiomyocytes without 
      inflammatory cellular infiltrates, depletion of splenic white pulp, focal 
      hepatocellular degeneration and rare glomerular capillary thrombosis. Each had 
      evidence of chronic cardiac disease: hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (420 
      g heart), dilated cardiomyopathy (1070 g heart), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
      (670 g heart). All 3 subjects were obese (BMIs of 33.8, 51.65, and 35.2 Kg/m(2)). 
      Overall, the autopsy findings support the concept that the pathogenesis of severe 
      COVID-19 disease involves direct viral-induced injury of multiple organs, including 
      heart and lungs, coupled with the consequences of a procoagulant state with 
      coagulopathy.

AB  - Background: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is prevalent around the world. We 
      aimed to describe epidemiological features and clinical course in Shanghai. Methods: 
      We retrospectively analysed 325 cases admitted at Shanghai Public Health Clinical 
      Center, between January 20 and February 29, 2020. Results: 47.4% (154/325) had 
      visited Wuhan within 2 weeks of illness onset. 57.2% occurred in 67 clusters; 40% 
      were situated within 53 family clusters. 83.7% developed fever during the disease 
      course. Median times from onset to first medical care, hospitalization and negative 
      detection of nucleic acid by nasopharyngeal swab were 1, 4 and 8 days. Patients with 
      mild disease using glucocorticoid tended to have longer viral shedding in blood and 
      feces. At admission, 69.8% presented with lymphopenia and 38.8% had elevated 
      D-dimers. Pneumonia was identified in 97.5% (314/322) of cases by chest CT scan. 
      Severe-critical patients were 8% with a median time from onset to critical disease 
      of 10.5 days. Half required oxygen therapy and 7.1% high-flow nasal oxygen. The case 
      fatality rate was 0.92% with median time from onset to death of 16 days. Conclusion: 
      COVID-19 cases in Shanghai were imported. Rapid identification, and effective 
      control measures helped to contain the outbreak and prevent community transmission.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the defining global health 
      crisis of our time and the greatest challenge facing the world. Meteorological 
      parameters are reportedly crucial factors affecting respiratory infectious disease 
      epidemics; however, the effect of meteorological parameters on COVID-19 remains 
      controversial. This study investigated the effects of temperature and relative 
      humidity on daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19, which has useful 
      implications for policymakers and the public. Daily data on meteorological 
      conditions, new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 were collected for 166 countries 
      (excluding China) as of March 27, 2020. Log-linear generalized additive model was 
      used to analyze the effects of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases 
      and daily new deaths of COVID-19, with potential confounders controlled for, 
      including wind speed, median age of the national population, Global Health Security 
      Index, Human Development Index and population density. Our findings revealed that 
      temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to daily new cases 
      and deaths. A 1Â Â°C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 
      1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) 
      reduction in daily new deaths, whereas a 1% increase in relative humidity was 
      associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 
      0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. The results remained 
      robust when different lag structures and the sensitivity analysis were used. These 
      findings provide preliminary evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially 
      suppressed with temperature and humidity increases. However, active measures must be 
      taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further 
      spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in China and quickly spread globally. In this 
      study, we investigated the characteristics of viral shedding from different sites 
      and the neutralizing antibody (NAb) response during the acute and convalescent 
      phases of nine children with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in their 
      nasopharyngeal swabs (9/9, 100%), stool samples (8/9, 89%), and oropharyngeal swabs 
      (3/9, 33%) but was not detected in their serum and urine samples. The median 
      duration of viral shedding detected in nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, 
      and stools was 13, 4, and 43 days respectively, and the maximum duration of viral 
      shedding detected from stools was 46 days after discharge. In children, 
      nasopharyngeal swabs appear to be a more sensitive specimen type for the diagnosis 
      of COVID-19 compared with oropharyngeal swabs. Three of eight patients produced NAbs 
      in the acute phase, and NAbs were detected in all eight patients with convalescent 
      sera. The results of this study provide valuable information for the diagnosis and 
      surveillance of COVID-19 and development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for use in children.

AB  - Remdesivir (GS-5734), a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) inhibitor that can 
      be used to treat a variety of RNA virus infections, is expected to be an effective 
      treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection. On May 1, 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 
      Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. In 
      light of the COVID-19 pandemic, this review presents comprehensive information on 
      remdesivir, including information regarding the milestones, intellectual properties, 
      anti-coronavirus mechanisms, preclinical research and clinical trials, and in 
      particular, the chemical synthesis, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmacodynamics and 
      pharmacokinetics of remdesivir. Furthermore, perspectives regarding the use of 
      remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 are also discussed.

AB  - This study attempts to document the nexus between weather, COVID-19 outbreak in 
      Wuhan and the Chinese economy. We used daily average temperature (hourly data), 
      daily new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, and RMB (Chinese currency) exchange 
      rate to represent the weather, COVID-19 outbreak and the Chinese economy, 
      respectively. The methodology of Wavelet Transform Coherence (WTC), Partial Wavelet 
      Coherence (PWC) and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) is employed to analyze the 
      daily data collected from 21st January 2020 to 31st March 2020. The results have 
      revealed a significant coherence between the series at different time-frequency 
      combinations. The overall results suggest the insignificance of an increase in 
      temperature to contain or slow down the new COVID-19 infections. The RMB exchange 
      rate and the COVID-19 showed an out phase coherence at specific time-frequency spots 
      suggesting a negative but limited impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan on the 
      Chinese export economy. Our results are contrary to many earlier studies which 
      suggest a significant role of temperature in slowing down the COVID-19 spread. These 
      results can have important policy implications for the containment of COVID-19 
      spread and macro-economic management with respect to changes in the weather.

AB  - Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals can be highly 
      infectious while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic, and that an infected person may 
      infect 5.6 other individuals on average. This situation highlights the need for 
      rapid, sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays capable of high-throughput operation 
      that can preferably utilize existing equipment to facilitate broad, large-scale 
      screening efforts. We have developed a CRISPR-based assay that can meet all these 
      criteria. This assay utilizes a custom CRISPR Cas12a/gRNA complex and a fluorescent 
      probe to detect target amplicons produced by standard RT-PCR or isothermal 
      recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), to allow sensitive detection at sites 
      not equipped with real-time PCR systems required for qPCR diagnostics. We found this 
      approach allowed sensitive and robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, with 
      a sample-to-answer time of ~50Â min, and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample. 
      CRISPR assay diagnostic results obtained nasal swab samples of individuals with 
      suspected COVID-19 cases were comparable to paired results from a CDC-approved 
      quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay performed in a state testing lab, and superior 
      to those produced by same assay in a clinical lab, where the RT-qPCR assay exhibited 
      multiple invalid or inconclusive results. Our assay also demonstrated greater 
      analytical sensitivity and more robust diagnostic performance than other recently 
      reported CRISPR-based assays. Based on these findings, we believe that a 
      CRISPR-based fluorescent application has potential to improve current COVID-19 
      screening efforts.

AB  - First isolated in China in early 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
      Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing 
      pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease has been spreading 
      rapidly across the globe, with the largest burden falling on China, Europe, and the 
      United States. COVID-19 is a new clinical syndrome, characterized by respiratory 
      symptoms with varying degrees of severity, from mild upper respiratory illness to 
      severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, aggravated by 
      thrombosis in the pulmonary microcirculation. Three main phases of disease 
      progression have been proposed for COVID-19: an early infection phase, a pulmonary 
      phase, and a hyperinflammation phase. Although current understanding of COVID-19 
      treatment is mainly derived from small uncontrolled trials that are affected by a 
      number of biases, strong background noise, and a litany of confounding factors, 
      emerging awareness suggests that drugs currently used to treat COVID-19 (antiviral 
      drugs, antimalarial drugs, immunomodulators, anticoagulants, and antibodies) should 
      be evaluated in relation to the pathophysiology of disease progression. Drawing upon 
      the dramatic experiences taking place in Italy and around the world, here we review 
      the changes in the evolution of the disease and focus on current treatment 
      uncertainties and promising new therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is nearly impossible to overestimate the burden of chronic pain, 
      which is associated with enormous personal and socioeconomic costs. Chronic pain is 
      the leading cause of disability in the world, is associated with multiple 
      psychiatric comorbidities, and has been causally linked to the opioid crisis. Access 
      to pain treatment has been called a fundamental human right by numerous 
      organizations. The current COVID-19 pandemic has strained medical resources, 
      creating a dilemma for physicians charged with the responsibility to limit spread of 
      the contagion and to treat the patients they are entrusted to care for. METHODS: To 
      address these issues, an expert panel was convened that included pain management 
      experts from the military, Veterans Health Administration, and academia. Endorsement 
      from stakeholder societies was sought upon completion of the document within a 
      one-week period. RESULTS: In these guidelines, we provide a framework for pain 
      practitioners and institutions to balance the often-conflicting goals of risk 
      mitigation for health care providers, risk mitigation for patients, conservation of 
      resources, and access to pain management services. Specific issues discussed include 
      general and intervention-specific risk mitigation, patient flow issues and staffing 
      plans, telemedicine options, triaging recommendations, strategies to reduce 
      psychological sequelae in health care providers, and resource utilization. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has strained health care systems, 
      creating a conundrum for patients, pain medicine practitioners, hospital leaders, 
      and regulatory officials. Although this document provides a framework for pain 
      management services, systems-wide and individual decisions must take into account 
      clinical considerations, regional health conditions, government and hospital 
      directives, resource availability, and the welfare of health care providers.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by 2019-nCov/SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic with 
      an urgent need for understanding the mechanisms and identifying a treatment. Viral 
      infections including SARS-CoV are associated with increased levels of reactive 
      oxygen species, disturbances of Ca(++) caused by unfolded protein response (UPR) 
      mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and is due to the exploitation of 
      virus's own protein i.e., viroporins into the host cells. Several clinical trials 
      are on-going including testing Remdesivir (anti-viral), Chloroquine and 
      Hydroxychloroquine derivatives (anti-malarial drugs) etc. Unfortunately, each drug 
      has specific limitations. Herein, we review the viral protein involvement to 
      activate ER stress transducers (IRE-1, PERK, ATF-6) and their downstream signals; 
      and evaluate combination therapies for COVID-19 mediated ER stress alterations. 
      Melatonin is an immunoregulator, anti-pyretic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and ER 
      stress modulator during viral infections. It enhances protective mechanisms for 
      respiratory tract disorders. Andrographolide, isolated from Andrographis paniculata, 
      has versatile biological activities including immunomodulation and determining 
      SARS-CoV-2 binding site. Considering the properties of both compounds in terms of 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-pyrogenic, anti-viral and ER stress modulation 
      and computational approaches revealing andrographolide docks with the SARS-CoV2 
      binding site, we predict that this combination therapy may have potential utility 
      against COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak is a sharp reminder that pandemics, like other rarely 
      occurring catastrophes, have happened in the past and will continue to happen in the 
      future. Even if we cannot prevent dangerous viruses from emerging, we should prepare 
      to dampen their effects on society. The current outbreak has had severe economic 
      consequences across the globe, and it does not look like any country will be 
      unaffected. This not only has consequences for the economy; all of society is 
      affected, which has led to dramatic changes in how businesses act and consumers 
      behave. This special issue is a global effort to address some of the 
      pandemic-related issues affecting society. In total, there are 13 papers that cover 
      different industry sectors (e.g., tourism, retail, higher education), changes in 
      consumer behavior and businesses, ethical issues, and aspects related to employees 
      and leadership.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is taking a colossal toll in human suffering and lives. A 
      significant amount of new scientific research and data sharing is underway due to 
      the pandemic which is still rapidly spreading. There is now a growing amount of 
      coronavirus related datasets as well as published papers that must be leveraged 
      along with artificial intelligence (AI) to fight this pandemic by driving news 
      approaches to drug discovery, vaccine development, and public awareness. AI can be 
      used to mine this avalanche of new data and papers to extract new insights by 
      cross-referencing papers and searching for patterns that AI algorithms could help 
      discover new possible treatments or help in vaccine development. Drug discovery is 
      not a trivial task and AI technologies like deep learning can help accelerate this 
      process by helping predict which existing drugs, or brand-new drug-like molecules 
      could treat COVID-19. AI techniques can also help disseminate vital information 
      across the globe and reduce the spread of false information about COVID-19. The 
      positive power and potential of AI must be harnessed in the fight to slow the spread 
      of COVID-19 in order to save lives and limit the economic havoc due to this horrific 
      disease.

AB  - Human life comes to a standstill as many countries shut themselves off from the work 
      due to the novel coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) that hit the world severely 
      in the first quarter of 2020. All types of industries, vehicle movement, and 
      people's activity suddenly halted, perhaps for the first time in modern history. For 
      a long time, it has been stated in various literature that the increased 
      industrialization and anthropogenic activities in the last two decades polluted the 
      atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. Since the industries and people's activities 
      have been shut off for a month or more in many parts of the world, it is expected to 
      show some improvement in the prevailing conditions in the aforementioned spheres of 
      environment. Here, with the help of remote sensing images, this work quantitatively 
      demonstrated the improvement in surface water quality in terms of suspended 
      particulate matter (SPM) in the Vembanad Lake, the longest freshwater lake in India. 
      The SPM estimated based on established turbidity algorithm from Landsat-8 OLI images 
      showed that the SPM concentration during the lockdown period decreased by 15.9% on 
      average (range: -10.3% to 36.4%, up to 8â¯mg/l decrease) compared with the 
      pre-lockdown period. Time series analysis of satellite image collections (April 2013 
      - April 2020) showed that the SPM quantified for April 2020 is the lowest for 11 out 
      of 20 zones of the Vembanad lake. When compared with preceding years, the percentage 
      decrease in SPM for April 2020 is up to 34% from the previous minima.

LID - 10.1212/NXI.0000000000000781 [doi]
LID - e781
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the COVID-19-associated GBS, the prototypic viral-triggered 
      autoimmune disease, in the context of other emerging COVID-19-triggered 
      autoimmunities, and discuss potential concerns with ongoing neuroimmunotherapies. 
      METHODS: Eleven GBS cases in four key COVID-19 hotspots are discussed regarding 
      presenting symptoms, response to therapies and cross-reactivity of COVID spike 
      proteins with nerve glycolipids. Emerging cases of COVID-19-triggered autoimmune 
      necrotizing myositis (NAM) and encephalopathies are also reviewed in the context of 
      viral invasion, autoimmunity and ongoing immunotherapies. RESULTS: Collective data 
      indicate that in this pandemic any patient presenting with an acute paralytic 
      disease-like GBS, encephalomyelitis or myositis-even without systemic symptoms, may 
      represent the first manifestation of COVID-19. Anosmia, ageusia, other cranial 
      neuropathies and lymphocytopenia are red flags enhancing early diagnostic suspicion. 
      In Miller-Fisher Syndrome, ganglioside antibodies against GD1b, instead of QG1b, 
      were found; because the COVID-19 spike protein also binds to sialic acid-containing 
      glycoproteins for cell-entry and anti-GD1b antibodies typically cause ataxic 
      neuropathy, cross-reactivity between COVID-19-bearing gangliosides and peripheral 
      nerve glycolipids was addressed. Elevated Creatine Kinase (>10,000) is reported in 
      10% of COVID-19-infected patients; two such patients presented with painful muscle 
      weakness responding to IVIg indicating that COVID-19-triggered NAM is an overlooked 
      entity. Cases of acute necrotizing brainstem encephalitis, cranial neuropathies with 
      leptomeningeal enhancement, and tumefactive postgadolinium-enhanced demyelinating 
      lesions are now emerging with the need to explore neuroinvasion and autoimmunity. 
      Concerns for modifications-if any-of chronic immunotherapies with steroids, 
      mycophenolate, azathioprine, IVIg, and anti-B-cell agents were addressed; the role 
      of complement in innate immunity to viral responses and anti-complement therapeutics 
      (i.e. eculizumab) were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging data indicate that COVID-19 
      can trigger not only GBS but other autoimmune neurological diseases necessitating 
      vigilance for early diagnosis and therapy initiation. Although COVID-19 infection, 
      like most other viruses, can potentially worsen patients with pre-existing 
      autoimmunity, there is no evidence that patients with autoimmune neurological 
      diseases stable on common immunotherapies are facing increased risks of infection.

      psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful 
      external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test 
      this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the 
      development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 
      adults completed a survey that captured COVID-related CT beliefs and broader 
      conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government 
      responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly 
      related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, 
      positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards 
      government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs 
      and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are 
      more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The 
      findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, 
      in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the 
      development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still progressing and has been 
      recorded in more than 210 countries and territories worldwide. In Bosnia and 
      Herzegovina, the first cases of COVID- 19 were detected on March 5, 2020 in the 
      entity of the Republic of Srpska and on March 9, 2020 in the entity of the 
      Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By May 16, 2020, more than 2,200 COVID-19 
      cases had been recorded in both entities, with a mortality rate of 5.8% (131 of 
      2,231 cases). The aim of this ongoing study is to present the current 
      epidemiological and sociodemographic parameters of 380 COVID-19 patients diagnosed 
      at the University Clinical Hospital Mostar (UCH Mostar) during the first two months 
      of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of those 380 patients, 60 (15.8%) required 
      hospitalization. The mortality rate was 5% (19/380). The highest mortality rate 
      (15.2%, 12/79) was recorded in the patients aged â¥65 years. In addition to this 
      single-center experience of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we discuss the 
      epidemiological mea-sures imposed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with an emphasis on the 
      restrictive measures. The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in Bosnia and 
      Herzegovina.

      neurological involvement in novel coronavirus disease-(COVID-19).
PG  - 283-292
LID - 10.17305/bjbms.2020.4860 [doi]
AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is believed to have emerged 
      from an animal source and has been spreading rapidly among humans. Recent evidence 
      shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropic properties and causes neurological 
      diseases. Here, we review the literature on neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 
      infections and the possible mechanisms of invasion of the nervous system by this 
      virus, to provide a summary and critical analysis of the early reporting of 
      neurological involvement in COVID-19. An exhaustive search of scientific articles on 
      neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, 
      Medline/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had 
      been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with 
      COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into 
      central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental 
      state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as 
      anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and 
      exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme 
      presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid 
      paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological 
      man-ifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system. In conclusion, 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple neurological syndromes in a more complex 
      presentation. Therefore, this review elucidated the involvement of the nervous 
      system in SARS-CoV-2 infection and will hopefully help improve the management of 
      COVID-19.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon stability and sequential irregularity of equity 
      and cryptocurrency markets.
PG  - 109936
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109936 [doi]
AB  - We explore the evolution of the informational efficiency in 45 cryptocurrency 
      markets and 16 international stock markets before and during COVID-19 pandemic. The 
      measures of Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) based on the Rosenstein's method and 
      Approximate Entropy (ApEn), which are robust to small samples, are applied to price 
      time series in order to estimate degrees of stability and irregularity in 
      cryptocurrency and international stock markets. The amount of regularity infers on 
      the unpredictability of fluctuations. The t-test and F-test are performed on 
      estimated LLE and ApEn. In total, 36 statistical tests are performed to check for 
      differences between time periods (pre- versus during COVID-19 pandemic samples) on 
      the one hand, as well as check for differences between markets (cryptocurrencies 
      versus stocks), on the other hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic period it was found 
      that (a) the level of stability in cryptocurrency markets has significantly 
      diminished while the irregularity level significantly augmented, (b) the level of 
      stability in international equity markets has not changed but gained more 
      irregularity, (c) cryptocurrencies became more volatile, (d) the variability in 
      stability and irregularity in equities has not been affected, (e) cryptocurrency and 
      stock markets exhibit a similar degree of stability in price dynamics, whilst 
      finally (f) cryptocurrency exhibit a low level of regularity compared to 
      international equity markets. We find that cryptos showed more instability and more 
      irregularity during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to international stock markets. 
      Thus, from an informational efficiency perspective, investing in digital assets 
      during big crises as the COVID-19 pandemic, could be considered riskier as opposed 
      to equities.

AB  - This study aimed to predict the short-term of confirmed cases of covid-19 and IBEX 
      in Spain by using SutteARIMA method. Confirmed data of Covid-19 in Spanish was 
      obtained from Worldometer and Spain Stock Market data (IBEX 35) was data obtained 
      from Yahoo Finance. Data started from 12 February 2020-09 April 2020 (the date on 
      Covid-19 was detected in Spain). The data from 12 February 2020-02 April 2020 using 
      to fitting with data from 03 April 2020 - 09 April 2020. Based on the fitting data, 
      we can conducted short-term forecast for 3 future period (10 April 2020 - 12 April 
      2020 for Covid-19 and 14 April 2020 - 16 April 2020 for IBEX). In this study, the 
      SutteARIMA method will be used. For the evaluation of the forecasting methods, we 
      applied forecasting accuracy measures, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Based 
      on the results of ARIMA and SutteARIMA forecasting methods, it can be concluded that 
      the SutteARIMA method is more suitable than ARIMA to calculate the daily forecasts 
      of confirmed cases of Covid-19 and IBEX in Spain. The MAPE value of 0.036 (smaller 
      than 0.03 compared to MAPE value of ARIMA) for confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain 
      and was in the amount of 0.026 for IBEX stock. At the end of the analysis, this 
      study used the SutteARIMA method, this study calculated daily forecasts of confirmed 
      cases of Covid-19 in Spain from 10 April 2020 until 12 April 2020 i.e. 158925; 
      164390; and 169969 and Spain Stock Market from 14 April 2020 until 16 April 2020 
      i.e. 7000.61; 6930.61; and 6860.62.

AB  - The emerging global infectious COVID-19 disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical threats to global public 
      health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China. The 
      virus has gone through various pathways of evolution. To understand the evolution 
      and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, genotyping of virus isolates is of great importance. 
      This study presents an accurate method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses 
      using complete genomes. The method employs the multiple sequence alignments of the 
      genome isolates with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) genotypes are then measured by Jaccard distances to track the 
      relationship of virus isolates. The genotyping analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from 
      the globe reveals that specific multiple mutations are the predominated mutation 
      type during the current epidemic. The proposed method serves an effective tool for 
      monitoring and tracking the epidemic of pathogenic viruses in their global and local 
      genetic variations. The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S 
      proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent 
      mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control.

AB  - Public health measures to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic, imposed also a shutdown 
      of sports facilities and swimming pools. Safety issues related to recreational 
      waters were emerging during the lockdown, rising concerns on how and when reopening 
      pools and on how improve their management while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the 
      population. The GSMS-SItI, Working Group on Movement Sciences for Health of the 
      Italian Society of Hygiene Preventive Medicine and Public Health, discussed and 
      summarized some indications for a suitable preventive approach. Several measures are 
      highlighted, including social distancing, optimized water management, airflow and 
      microclimatic parameters in the pool as well in the annexed rooms, verification of 
      sanitation procedures. The GSMS-SItI underlines that prevention should be based on 
      monitoring of the local epidemiological situation and on the constant collaboration 
      with the local health authority and the national health service.

AB  - In order to benefit the public, community workers and scientific community, we 
      hereby present a chronicle of SARS-CoV-2 that leads to the unseen precedent of 
      social distancing and lockdown owing to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Information 
      on this life-threatening pandemic of COVID-19 is sparse and discrete; and the 
      urgency is such that the dissemination of information is increasing with numerous 
      daily publications on the topic. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive review on 
      various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We scientifically compiled published 
      research, news, and reports from various sources to comprehend and summarize the 
      information and findings on Coronaviruses. The review explicitly covers the aspects 
      like genome and pedigree of SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology, prognosis, pathogenesis, 
      symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 in order to catalog the right information on 
      transmission route, and influence of environmental factors on virus transmissions, 
      for the robust understanding of right strategical steps for proper COVID-19 
      management. We have explicitly highlighted several useful information and facts 
      like: i) No established relationship between progression of SARS-CoV-2 with 
      temperature, humidity and/or both, ii) The underlying mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is not 
      fully understood, iii) Respiratory droplet size determines drop and airborne-based 
      transmission, iv) Prognosis of COVID-19 can be done by its effects on various body 
      organs, v) Infection can be stopped by restricting the binding of S protein and AE2, 
      vi) Hydroxychloroquine is believed to be better than chloroquine for COVID-19, vii) 
      Ivermectin with Vero-hSLAM cells is able to reduce infection by ~5000 time within 
      2Â days, and viii) Nafamostat mesylate can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S protein-initiated 
      membrane fusion. We have also suggested future research perspectives, challenges and 
      scope.

AB  - Human coronaviruses, especially COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic infectious disease 
      with high morbidity and mortality. Coronaviruses are associated with comorbidities, 
      along with the symptoms of it. SARS-CoV-2 is one of the highly pathogenic 
      coronaviruses that causes a high death rate compared to the SARS-CoV and MERS. In 
      this review, we focused on the mechanism of coronavirus with comorbidities and 
      impairment in multi-organ function. The main dysfunction upon coronavirus infection 
      is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. It is associated with the other 
      organ damage such as cardiovascular risk via an increased level of hypertension 
      through ACE2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, diabetes 
      mellitus, liver dysfunction, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risks such as chemosis, 
      conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia, cancer risk, venous thromboembolism, 
      tuberculosis, aging, and cardiovascular dysfunction and reproductive risk. Along 
      with this, we have discussed the immunopathology and coronaviruses at a molecular 
      level and therapeutic approaches for the coronavirus infection. The comorbidities 
      and multi-organ failure of COVID-19 have been explained at a molecular level along 
      with the base of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This review would help us to understand 
      the comorbidities associated with the coronaviruses with multi-organ damage.

TI  - Modeling Nigerian Covid-19 cases: A comparative analysis of models and estimators.
PG  - 109911
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109911 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19 remains a major pandemic currently threatening all the countries of the 
      world. In Nigeria, there were 1, 932 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 319 discharged cases 
      and 58 deaths as of 30th April 2020. This paper, therefore, subjected the daily 
      cumulative reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to nine (9) curve 
      estimation statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms. It 
      further identified the best of the thirty-six (36) models and used the same for 
      prediction and forecasting purposes. The data collected by the Nigeria Centre for 
      Disease Control for sixty-four (64) days, two (2) months and three (3), were daily 
      monitored and eventually analyzed. We identified the best models to be Quartic 
      Linear Regression Model with an autocorrelated error of order 1 (AR(1)); and found 
      the Ordinary Least Squares, Cochrane Orcutt, Hildreth-Lu, and Prais-Winsten and 
      Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimators useful to estimate the models' parameters. 
      Consequently, we recommended the daily cumulative forecast values of the LAD 
      estimator for May and June 2020 with a 99% confidence level. The forecast values are 
      alarming, and so, the Nigerian Government needs to hastily review her activities and 
      interventions towards COVID-19 to provide some tactical and robust structures and 
      measures to avert these challenges.

AB  - The COVID-19 global crisis is reshaping Canadian society in unexpected and profound 
      ways. The significantly higher morbidity and mortality risks by age suggest that 
      this is largely a "gero-pandemic," which has thrust the field of aging onto center 
      stage. This editorial emphasizes that vulnerable older adults are also those most 
      affected by COVID-19 in terms of infection risk, negative health effects, and the 
      potential deleterious outcomes on a range of social, psychological, and economic 
      contexts - from ageism to social isolation. We also contend that the pathogenic 
      analysis of this pandemic needs to be balanced with a salutogenic approach that 
      examines the positive adaptation of people, systems and society, termed COVID-19 
      resilience. This begs the question: how and why do some older adults and communities 
      adapt and thrive better than others? This examination will lead to the 
      identification and response to research and data gaps, challenges, and innovative 
      opportunities as we plan for a future in which COVID-19 has become another endemic 
      infection in the growing list of emerging and re-emerging pathogens.

AB  - Sewage can be used to determine the scale of COVID-19 outbreak. Sewage Epidemiology 
      or Waste Based Epidemiology (WBE) approach has been successfully used to track and 
      provide early warnings of outbreaks of pathogenic viruses such as Hepatitis A, 
      Poliovirus and Norovirus. In untreated wastewater COVID-19 (excreted via faeces then 
      introduced to wastewater) can survive from hours to days. Detection of COVID-19 can 
      be carried out with nucleic acid-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, used 
      for confirmation of COVID-19 patients around the globe. New cheaper and faster 
      monitoring tools are being developed to detect Covid-19 in wastewater by biosensors, 
      ELISA, or paper-based indicator methods. This will allow to reveal true scale of 
      Covid-19 outbreak associated with population link to a specific wastewater treatment 
      plant.

AB  - Due to the close relationship between the incidence of infectious diseases by 
      epidemics and environmental conditions, this research explores the temperature, 
      evaporation, precipitation and regional climate effects on the local transmission of 
      coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 inside 31 states and capital of Mexico since February 29 
      (national onset) to March 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was conducted to explore 
      the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and 
      both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional 
      meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was 
      calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion 
      days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association 
      between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC 
      and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The 
      associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically 
      significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95â¯Â°C and mean 
      precipitation around 8.74â¯mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional 
      onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and 
      higher precipitations (20.57â¯Â°C and 20.87â¯mm respectively) than the observed in the 
      tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in 
      states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered 
      (19.65â¯Â°C and 8.48â¯mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on 
      the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and 
      susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics 
      played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered 
      regions (as MichoacÃ¡n, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as 
      Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, 
      Morelos etc.).

AB  - In this study, we aimed at analyzing the associations between transmission of and 
      deaths caused by SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological variables, such as average 
      temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation. Two 
      outcome measures were considered, with the first aiming to study SARS-CoV-2 
      infections and the second aiming to study COVID-19 mortality. Daily data as well as 
      data on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 mortality obtained between December 1, 
      2019 and March 28, 2020 were collected from weather stations around the world. The 
      country's population density and time of exposure to the disease were used as 
      control variables. Finally, a month dummy variable was added. Daily data by country 
      were analyzed using the panel data model. An increase in the average daily 
      temperature by one degree Fahrenheit reduced the number of cases by approximately 
      6.4 cases/day. There was a negative correlation between the average temperature per 
      country and the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This association remained 
      strong even with the incorporation of additional variables and controls (maximum 
      temperature, average temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation) and fixed 
      country effects. There was a positive correlation between precipitation and 
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries with higher rainfall measurements showed an 
      increase in disease transmission. For each average inch/day, there was an increase 
      of 56.01 cases/day. COVID-19 mortality showed no significant association with 
      temperature.

AB  - The emergences of coronaviruses have caused a serious global public health problem 
      because their infection in humans caused the severe acute respiratory disease and 
      deaths. The outbreaks of lethal coronaviruses have taken place for three times 
      within recent two decades (SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 
      2019). Much more serious than SARS-CoV in 2002, the current SARS-CoV-2 infection has 
      been spreading to more than 213 countries, areas or territories and causing more 
      than two million cases up to date (17 April 2020). Unfortunately, no vaccine and 
      specific anti-coronavirus drugs are available at present time. Current clinical 
      treatment at hand is inadequate to suppress viral replication and inflammation, and 
      reverse organ failure. Intensive research efforts have focused on increasing our 
      understanding of viral biology of SARS-CoV-2, improving antiviral therapy and 
      vaccination strategies. The animal models are important for both the fundamental 
      research and drug discovery of coronavirus. This review aims to summarize the animal 
      models currently available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and their potential use for 
      the study of SARS-CoV-2. We will discuss the benefits and caveats of these animal 
      models and present critical findings that might guide the fundamental studies and 
      urgent treatment of SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread over many countries and regions 
      since the end of 2019, becoming the most severe public health event at present. Most 
      of the critical cases developed multiple organ dysfunction, including acute kidney 
      injury (AKI). Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) may complicate the process of severe 
      COVID-19 patients. This manuscript reviews the different aspects of blood 
      purification in critically ill patients with AKI and increased inflammatory factors, 
      and examines its potential role in severe COVID-19 treatment. Continuous renal 
      replacement therapy (CRRT) has been practiced in many sepsis patients with AKI. 
      Still, the timing and dosing need further robust evidence. In addition to the 
      traditional CRRT, the high-throughput membrane with adsorption function and cytokine 
      adsorption column are two representatives of recently emerging novel membrane 
      technologies. Their potential in removing inflammatory factors and other toxins 
      prospects for the treatment of severe COVID-19.

AB  - The present study examines the asymmetrical effect of temperature on COVID-19 
      (Coronavirus Disease) from 22 January 2020 to 31 March 2020 in the 10 most affected 
      provinces in China. This study used the Sim & Zhou' quantile-on-quantile (QQ) 
      approach to analyze how the temperature quantities affect the different quantiles of 
      COVID-19. Daily COVID-19 and, temperature data collected from the official websites 
      of the Chinese National Health Commission and Weather Underground Company (WUC) 
      respectively. Empirical results have shown that the relationship between temperature 
      and COVID-19 is mostly positive for Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui, while mostly negative 
      for Zhejiang and Shandong provinces. The remaining five provinces Guangdong, Henan, 
      Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang are showing the mixed trends. These differences 
      among the provinces can be explained by the differences in the number of COVID-19 
      cases, temperature, and the province's overall hospital facilitations. The study 
      concludes that maintaining a safe and comfortable atmosphere for patients while 
      COVID-19 is being treated may be rational.

AB  - BACKGROUND: When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were 
      home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. This study explored the 
      prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of 
      home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk 
      factors. METHOD: The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 
      universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist 
      Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data 
      on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables 
      were also collected. RESULTS: The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 
      2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk 
      factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their 
      graduating year (4(th) year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations 
      was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be 
      serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations 
      need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and 
      graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.

AB  - According to data compiled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, 
      Maryland, more than two and half million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), caused by a newly discovered virus named severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed on April 20, 2020 (Nature, 
      2020b). Since the emergence of this infectious disease in Asia (Wuhan, China) late 
      last year, it has been subsequently span to every continent of the world except 
      Antarctica (RodrÃ­guez-Morales et al., 2020). Along with a foothold in every country, 
      the current disease pandemic is disrupting practically every aspect of life all over 
      the world. As the outbreak are continuing to evolve, several research activities 
      have been conducted for better understanding the origin, functions, treatments, and 
      preventions of this novel coronavirus. This review will be a summa of the key 
      features of novel coronavirus (nCoV), the virus causing disease 2019 and the present 
      epidemic situation worldwide up to April 20, 2020. It is expected that this record 
      will play an important role to take more preventive measures for overcoming the 
      challenges faced during this current pandemic.

AB  - Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of environmental surveillance 
      through the monitoring of sewage for the assessment of viruses circulating in a 
      given community (wastewater-based epidemiology, WBE). During the COVID-19 public 
      health emergency, many reports have described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 
      stools from COVID-19 patients, and a few studies reported the occurrence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters worldwide. Italy is among the world's worst-affected 
      countries in the COVID-19 pandemic, but so far there are no studies assessing the 
      presence of SARS-CoV-2 in Italian wastewaters. To this aim, twelve influent sewage 
      samples, collected between February and April 2020 from Wastewater Treatment Plants 
      in Milan and Rome, were tested adapting, for concentration, the standard WHO 
      procedure for Poliovirus surveillance. Molecular analysis was undertaken with three 
      nested protocols, including a newly designed SARS-CoV-2 specific primer set. 
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was accomplished in volumes of 250Â ml of wastewaters 
      collected in areas of high (Milan) and low (Rome) epidemic circulation, according to 
      clinical data. Overall, 6 out of 12 samples were positive. One of the positive 
      results was obtained in a Milan wastewater sample collected a few days after the 
      first notified Italian case of autochthonous SARS-CoV-2. The study confirms that WBE 
      has the potential to be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as a sensitive tool to study spatial 
      and temporal trends of virus circulation in the population.

AB  - The novel coronavirus, later identified as SARS-CoV-2, originating from Wuhan in 
      China in November 2019, quickly spread around the world becoming a pandemic. Despite 
      the knowledge of previous coronaviruses, such as those responsible for the SARS and 
      MERS-CoV epidemic, there is no drug or prophylaxis treatment to this day. The rapid 
      succession of scientific findings on SARS-CoV-2 provides a significant number of 
      potential drug targets. Nevertheless, at the same time, the high quantity of 
      clinical data, generated by a large number of rapidly infected people, require 
      accurate tests regarding effective medical treatments. Several in vitro and in vivo 
      studies were rapidly initiated after the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19. Initial 
      clinical studies revealed the promising potential of remdesivir that demonstrated a 
      powerful and specific in vitro antiviral activity for COVID-19. Promising effects 
      appear to be attributable to hydroxychloroquine. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine 
      are being tested in ongoing randomized trials. In contrast, oseltamivir was not 
      effective and corticosteroids are not currently recommended. However, few data from 
      ongoing clinical trials are identifying low molecular weight heparins, innate immune 
      system stimulating agents, and inflammatory modulating agents as potential effective 
      agents. The authors assume that the current pandemic will determine the need for a 
      systematic approach based on big data analysis for identifying effective drugs to 
      defeat SARS-Cov-2. This work is aimed to be a general reference point and to provide 
      an overview as comprehensive as possible regarding the main clinical trials in 
      progress at the moment.

AB  - At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, designated as SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, 
      China and was identified as the causal pathogen of COVID-19. The epidemic scale of 
      COVID-19 has increased dramatically, with confirmed cases increasing across China 
      and globally. Understanding the potential affecting factors involved in COVID-19 
      transmission will be of great significance in containing the spread of the epidemic. 
      Environmental and meteorological factors might impact the occurrence of COVID-19, as 
      these have been linked to various diseases, including severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose causative 
      pathogens belong to the same virus family as SARS-CoV-2. We collected daily data of 
      COVID-19 confirmed cases, air quality and meteorological variables of 33 locations 
      in China for the outbreak period of 29 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. The 
      association between air quality index (AQI) and confirmed cases was estimated 
      through a Poisson regression model, and the effects of temperature and humidity on 
      the AQI-confirmed cases association were analyzed. The results show that the effect 
      of AQI on confirmed cases associated with an increase in each unit of AQI was 
      statistically significant in several cities. The lag effect of AQI on the confirmed 
      cases was statistically significant on lag day 1 (relative risk (RR)Â =Â 1.0009, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 1.0004, 1.0013), day 2 (RRÂ =Â 1.0007, 95% CI: 1.0003, 
      1.0012) and day 3 (RRÂ =Â 1.0008, 95% CI: 1.0003, 1.0012). The AQI effect on the 
      confirmed cases might be stronger in the temperature range of 10Â Â°CÂ â¤Â TÂ <Â 20Â Â°C than 
      in other temperature ranges, while the RR of COVID-19 transmission associated with 
      AQI was higher in the relative humidity (RH) range of 10%Â â¤Â RHÂ <Â 20%. Results may 
      suggest an enhanced impact of AQI on the COVID-19 spread under low RH.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) may alter the immune status and thus 
      increase the susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with 
      MS or neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD). However, evidence supporting 
      this notion is currently lacking. In this study, we conducted a survey on the risk 
      of COVID-19 in patients with MS and NMOSD. METHODS: The survey was conducted through 
      the Chinese Medical Network for Neuroinflammation. Patients in 10 MS centers from 8 
      cities including Wuhan were included. Information about MS and NMOSD disease 
      duration and the usage of DMDs were collected. Data of suspected cases of COVID-19 
      were obtained from hospital visits, questionnaires, and patient self-reporting. 
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was confirmed 
      through clinical evaluation by a panel of experts in conjunction with chest CT and 
      viral RNA detection. RESULTS: Eight hundred eighty-two of 1,804 (48.89%) patients 
      with MS and 2,129 of 3,060 (69.58%) patients with NMOSD were receiving DMDs. There 
      were no alterations in the patients' DMD regimen during January 15, 2020, to March 
      15, 2020, the 3-month period. None of the patients with MS treated with DMDs had 
      COVID-19. However, 2 patients with relapsing NMOSD were diagnosed with 
      COVID-19-related pneumonia. After treatment, both patients recovered from pneumonia 
      and neither patient experienced new attacks due to predisposing SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      in the following 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of COVID-19 infection was 
      observed in patients with MS or NMOSD, irrespective of whether these patients 
      received DMDs. A battery of stringent preventive measures adopted by neurologists to 
      reduce COVID-19 infection in these patients may have contributed to low risk of 
      COVID-19 infection.

AB  - As we are facing worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, we aimed to identify potential 
      pathophysiological mechanisms leading to increased COVID-19 susceptibility and 
      severity in obesity. Special emphasis will be given on increased susceptibility to 
      infections due to obesity-related low-grade chronic inflammation, higher expression 
      of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 and pathway-associated components, as well as 
      decreased vitamin D bioavailability, since all of them provide easier ways for the 
      virus to enter into host cells, replicate and stunt adequate immune responses.

AB  - As of June 10th 2020 about 7.2 million individuals have tested positive for, and 
      more than 410,000 have died due to COVID-19. In this review we outline the 
      pathophysiology that underpins the potential use of anti-rheumatic therapies for 
      severe COVID-19 infection and summarize the current evidence regarding the risk and 
      outcome of COVID-19 in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. Thus far there is 
      no convincing evidence that any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (conventional 
      synthetic, biologic or targeted synthetic) including hydroxychloroquine, may protect 
      against severe COVID-19 infection; answers about their possible usefulness in the 
      management of the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-9 infection will only 
      arise from ongoing randomized controlled trials. Evidence on COVID-19 risk and 
      outcome in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases is extremely limited; thus, 
      any conclusions would be unsafe and should be seen with great caution. At present, 
      the risk and severity (hospitalization, intensive care unit admission and death) of 
      COVID-19 infection in people with autoimmune diseases do not appear particularly 
      dissimilar to the general population, with the possible exception of hospitalization 
      in patients exposed to high glucocorticoid doses. At this stage it is impossible to 
      draw any conclusions for differences in COVID-19 risk and outcome between different 
      autoimmune diseases and between the various immunomodulatory therapies used for 
      them. More research in the field is obviously required, including as a minimum 
      careful and systematic epidemiology and appropriately controlled clinical trials.

AB  - To contain COVID-19 spread, Italy is under a global lockdown since February 21, 
      2020, except for health services and food supply. In this scenario, growing 
      apprehension concerning legal consequences is rising among health professionals due 
      to several ethical and legal questions. Even if medical ethicists may approve 
      patients' prioritization protocols, hospitals and health professionals remain highly 
      exposed to liability. The so-called smart-working may be very useful, but it may 
      harbor potential legal harms for health personnel and patients and safety. Moreover, 
      personal umbrella policies also often exclude liability arising out of the 
      transmission of a communicable disease, especially a pandemic state, is declared. 
      Under the pressure of medical associations, Italian Government political forces have 
      very recently presented an amendment to the recently released ordinances for the 
      COVID-19 emergency aimed to reduce medical liability. Presumably, similar epidemics 
      or other wide-scale similar events may happen again in an unpredictable future. 
      Therefore, more articulated legal regulations are strongly needed starting from 
      lessons learned from this epidemic.

AB  - We forecast 1,000,000 COVID-19 cases outside of China by March 31st, 2020 based on a 
      heuristic and WHO situation reports. We do not model the COVID-19 pandemic; we model 
      only the number of cases. The proposed heuristic is based on a simple observation 
      that the plot of the given data is well approximated by an exponential curve. The 
      exponential curve is used for forecasting the growth of new cases. It has been 
      tested for the last situation report of the last day. Its accuracy has been 1.29% 
      for the last day added and predicted by the 57 previous WHO situation reports (the 
      date 18 March 2020). Prediction, forecast, pandemic, COVID-19, coronavirus, 
      exponential growth curve parameter, heuristic, epidemiology, extrapolation, 
      abductive reasoning, WHO situation report.

AB  - The current pandemic (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health challenge with active development of 
      antiviral drugs and vaccines seeking to reduce its significant disease burden. Early 
      reports have confirmed that transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and 
      angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are critical targets of SARS-CoV-2 that 
      facilitate viral entry into host cells. TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are expressed in multiple 
      human tissues beyond the lung including the testes where predisposition to 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection may exist. TMPRSS2 is an androgen-responsive gene and its 
      fusion represents one of the most frequent alterations in prostate cancer. Androgen 
      suppression by androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor signaling 
      inhibitors form the foundation of prostate cancer treatment. In this review, we 
      highlight the growing evidence in support of androgen regulation of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 
      and the potential clinical implications of using androgen suppression to 
      downregulate TMPRSS2 to target SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the future directions and 
      controversies that need to be addressed in order to establish the viability of 
      targeting TMPRSS2 and/or ACE2 through androgen signaling regulation for COVID-19 
      treatment, particularly its relevance in the context of prostate cancer management.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly 
      worldwide since it was confirmed as the causative agent of COVID-19. Molecular 
      diagnosis of the disease is typically performed via nucleic acid-based detection of 
      the virus from swabs, sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). However, the 
      positive rate from the commonly used specimens (swabs or sputum) was less than 75%. 
      Immunological assays for SARS-CoV-2 are needed to accurately diagnose COVID-19. Sera 
      were collected from patients or healthy people in a local hospital in Xiangyang, 
      Hubei Province, China. The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies were then detected 
      using a SARS-CoV-2 IgM colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (GICA). Results 
      were analysed in combination with sera collection date and clinical information. The 
      GICA was found to be positive with the detected 82.2% (37/45) of RT-qPCR confirmed 
      COVID-19 cases, as well as 32.0% (8/25) of clinically confirmed, RT-qPCR negative 
      patients (4-14 days after symptom onset). Investigation of IgM-negative, 
      RT-qPCR-positive COVID-19 patients showed that half of them developed severe 
      disease. The GICA was found to be a useful test to complement existing PCR-based 
      assays for confirmation of COVID-19, and a delayed specific IgM antibody response 
      was observed among COVID-19 patients with severe progression.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused more than 
      200,000 reported COVID-19 cases in Spain resulting in more than 20,800 deaths as of 
      April 21, 2020. Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has 
      extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 
      RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities 
      within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence 
      within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation 
      concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic 
      Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average 
      recoveries of 10Â Â±Â 3.5% and 10Â Â±Â 2.1% in influent water (nÂ =Â 2) and 3.3Â Â±Â 1.6% and 
      6.2Â Â±Â 1.0% in effluent water (nÂ =Â 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, 
      the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 
      14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the 
      real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three 
      regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of 
      SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4Â Â±Â 0.2 log(10) genomic 
      copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and 
      all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12). This environmental 
      surveillance data were compared to declared COVID-19 cases at municipality level, 
      revealing that members of the community were shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their stool 
      even before the first cases were reported by local or national authorities in many 
      of the cities where wastewaters have been sampled. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 
      wastewater in early stages of the spread of COVID-19 highlights the relevance of 
      this strategy as an early indicator of the infection within a specific population. 
      At this point, this environmental surveillance could be implemented by 
      municipalities right away as a tool, designed to help authorities to coordinate the 
      exit strategy to gradually lift its coronavirus lockdown.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) became a nightmare for the world since December 
      2019. Although the disease affects people at any age; elderly patients and those 
      with comorbidities were more affected. Everyday nephrologists see patients with 
      hypertension, chronic kidney disease, maintenance dialysis treatment or kidney 
      transplant who are also high-risk groups for the COVID-19. Beyond that, COVID-19 or 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to infection may directly affect kidney 
      functions. This broad spectrum of COVID-19 influence on kidney patients and kidney 
      functions obviously necessitate an up to date management policy for nephrological 
      care. This review overviews and purifies recently published literature in a question 
      to answer format for the practicing nephrologists that will often encounter COVID-19 
      and kidney related cases during the pandemic times.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Early detection of COVID-19 and 
      immediate isolation of infected patients from the naive population are important to 
      prevent further pandemic spread of the infection. Real-time reverse transcription 
      (RT)-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA is currently the most reliable diagnostic method 
      for confirming COVID-19 worldwide. Guidelines for clinical laboratories on the 
      COVID-19 diagnosis have been recently published by Korean Society for Laboratory 
      Medicine and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, these 
      formal guidelines do not address common practical laboratory issues related to 
      COVID-19 real-time RT-PCR testing and their solutions. Therefore, this guideline is 
      intended as a practical and technical supplement to the "Guidelines for Laboratory 
      Diagnosis of COVID-19 in Korea".

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease from a 
      novel coronavirus that was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is 
      now a public health emergency and pandemic. Singapore, as a major international 
      transportation hub in Asia, has been one of the worst hit countries by the disease. 
      With the advent of local transmission, the authors share their preparation and 
      response planning for the operating room of the National Heart Centre Singapore, the 
      largest cardiothoracic tertiary center in Singapore. Protection of staff and 
      patients, environmental concerns, and other logistic and equipment issues are 
      considered.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 
      virus, is now causing a tremendous global health concern. Since its first appearance 
      in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections 
      worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early 
      virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique 
      characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the 
      viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon 
      antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV 
      interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 
      nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress 
      primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has 
      been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and 
      protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence 
      similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase 
      activities. Among the 27 viral proteins, SARS-CoV-2 orf6 demonstrated the strongest 
      suppression on both primary interferon production and interferon signalling. 
      Orf6-deleted SARS-CoV-2 may be considered for the development of intranasal 
      live-but-attenuated vaccine against COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) is globally spreading and the international 
      cooperation is urgently required in joint prevention and control of the epidemic. 
      Using the Maximum-Hasting (MH) parameter estimation method and the modified 
      Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model, the spread of the epidemic 
      under three intervention scenarios (suppression, mitigation, mildness) is simulated 
      and predicted in South Africa, Egypt, and Algeria, where the epidemic situations are 
      severe. The studies are also conducted in Nigeria, Senegal and Kenya, where the 
      epidemic situations are growing rapidly and the socio-economic are relatively 
      under-developed, resulting in more difficulties in preventing the epidemic. Results 
      indicated that the epidemic can be basically controlled in late April with strict 
      control of scenario one, manifested by the circumstance in the South Africa and 
      Senegal. Under moderate control of scenario two, the number of infected people will 
      increase by 1.43-1.55 times of that in scenario one, the date of the epidemic being 
      controlled will be delayed by about 10Â days, and Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya are in 
      accordance with this situation. In the third scenario of weak control, the epidemic 
      will be controlled by late May, the total number of infected cases will double that 
      in scenario two, and Egypt is in line with this prediction. In the end, a series of 
      epidemic controlling methods are proposed, including patient quarantine, close 
      contact tracing, population movement control, government intervention, city and 
      county epidemic risk level classification, and medical cooperation and the Chinese 
      assistance.

AB  - Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stools and sewage has recently been reported, 
      raising the hypothesis of faecal-oral transmission. If confirmed, this could have 
      far-reaching consequences for public health and for pandemic control strategies. In 
      this paper, we argue that a comprehensive and more nuanced analysis is required to 
      test this hypothesis, taking into consideration both environmental dynamics and the 
      persistence of viral infectivity. First, we examine the evidence regarding the 
      presence of the virus in stools and sewage. Then we discuss the current framework of 
      disease transmission through water and excreta and how the transmission of a 
      respiratory disease fits into it. Against this background, we propose a framework to 
      test the faecal-oral hypothesis, unpacking the different environmental routes from 
      faeces to the mouth of a susceptible person. This framework should not be seen as a 
      confirmation of the hypothesis but rather as an expanded view of its complexities, 
      which could help shaping an agenda for research into a number of unanswered 
      questions. Finally, the paper briefly discusses practical implications, based on 
      current knowledge, for containment of the pandemic.

AB  - Given the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge negative impacts it is 
      causing, researching on COVID-19-related issues is very important for designing 
      proactive and comprehensive public health interventions to fight against the 
      pandemic. We describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients detected in the two 
      phases of the epidemic in Vietnam. Data used in this paper were mainly obtained from 
      the official database of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam. Descriptive statistics 
      were carried out using Stata 16 software. As of 18 May 2020, the cumulative number 
      of COVID-19 cases detected in Vietnam was 324, 16 cases from 4 cities and provinces 
      in the first phase (during 20Â days, 0.8 cases detected per day) and 308 cases from 
      35 cities, provinces in the second phase (during 76Â days, 4.1 cases detected per 
      day). Vietnam has mobilized its entire political system to fight the COVID-19 and 
      achieved some initial successes. We found both similarities and differences between 
      the two phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam. We demonstrated that the 
      situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam is getting more complicated and 
      unpredictable.

AB  - Coronoviraus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected over two million people worldwide 
      and the number keeps growing every day. While the pulmonary complications of 
      COVID-19 are obvious, the effect of the virus on the other organs and the chronicity 
      of the organ dysfunction remain unknown. The virus causes a debilitating infection 
      with multiorgan injury and has a high mortality rate estimated to be around 3.70%. 
      Several hypotheses are formulated to explain the liver dysfunction in COVID-19 
      patients which include collateral damage from cytokine storm, drug-induced liver 
      injury, viral-induced hepatitis and hypoxia-induced damage. Through this case 
      series, we would like to highlight that liver enzyme abnormalities are often seen in 
      COVID-19 patients and would like to highlight that physicians need to serially 
      monitor biochemical testing until the liver enzymes return to baseline. Physicians 
      also need to be vigilant of liver enzyme abnormalities in these patients, especially 
      before starting new medications.

AB  - Confirmative diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections has been challenged due to 
      unsatisfactory positive rate of molecular assays. Here we identified a family 
      cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with five of six family members were 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobin serology testing positive, while molecular assays 
      only detected two of this five patients even repeated twice. We comprehensively 
      analyzed this familial cluster of cases based on the clinical characteristics, chest 
      CT images, SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection results, and serology testing results. At 
      last, two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, two were suspected of COVID-19, and 
      two were considered close contacts. Our results emphasized the significance of 
      serology testing to assist timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially for 
      COVID-19 close contacts screening.

AB  - Global efforts around the world are focused on to discuss several health care 
      strategies for minimizing the impact of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) on the 
      community. As it is clear that this virus becomes a public health threat and 
      spreading easily among individuals. Mathematical models with computational 
      simulations are effective tools that help global efforts to estimate key 
      transmission parameters and further improvements for controlling this disease. This 
      is an infectious disease and can be modeled as a system of non-linear differential 
      equations with reaction rates. This work reviews and develops some suggested models 
      for the COVID-19 that can address important questions about global health care and 
      suggest important notes. Then, we suggest an updated model that includes a system of 
      differential equations with transmission parameters. Some key computational 
      simulations and sensitivity analysis are investigated. Also, the local sensitivities 
      for each model state concerning the model parameters are computed using three 
      different techniques: non-normalizations, half normalizations, and full 
      normalizations. Results based on the computational simulations show that the model 
      dynamics are significantly changed for different key model parameters. 
      Interestingly, we identify that transition rates between asymptomatic infected with 
      both reported and unreported symptomatic infected individuals are very sensitive 
      parameters concerning model variables in spreading this disease. This helps 
      international efforts to reduce the number of infected individuals from the disease 
      and to prevent the propagation of new coronavirus more widely on the community. 
      Another novelty of this paper is the identification of the critical model 
      parameters, which makes it easy to be used by biologists with less knowledge of 
      mathematical modeling and also facilitates the improvement of the model for future 
      development theoretically and practically.

      increasing funding for the NHS. However, increased funding itself will not ease the 
      workload. With a number of our staff isolating from work due to COVID-19, we as the 
      workforce have to step out of comfort zones and work in unfamiliar specialties. 
      These are unprecedented times and are placing strains on our health service. 
      Nonetheless, we as healthcare professionals have taken oaths that we are honouring 
      and will continue to do so, till this virus is put to rest.

AB  - Chloroquine (CQ) and its analogue hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have been thrust into our 
      everyday vernacular because some believe, based on very limited basic and clinical 
      data, that they might be helpful in preventing and/or lessening the severity of the 
      pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, lacking is a temperance in 
      enthusiasm for their possible use as well as sufficient perspective on their effects 
      and side-effects. CQ and HCQ have well-known properties of being diprotic weak bases 
      that preferentially accumulate in acidic organelles (endolysosomes and Golgi 
      apparatus) and neutralize luminal pH of acidic organelles. These primary actions of 
      CQ and HCQ are responsible for their anti-malarial effects; malaria parasites rely 
      on acidic digestive vacuoles for survival. Similarly, de-acidification of 
      endolysosomes and Golgi by CQ and HCQ may block severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) integration into host cells because SARS-CoV-2 may 
      require an acidic environment for its entry and for its ability to bud and infect 
      bystander cells. Further, de-acidification of endolysosomes and Golgi may underly 
      the immunosuppressive effects of these two drugs. However, modern cell biology 
      studies have shown clearly that de-acidification results in profound changes in the 
      structure, function and cellular positioning of endolysosomes and Golgi, in 
      signaling between these organelles and other subcellular organelles, and in 
      fundamental cellular functions. Thus, studying the possible therapeutic effects of 
      CQ and HCQ against COVID-19 must occur concurrent with studies of the extent to 
      which these drugs affect organellar and cell biology. When comprehensively examined, 
      a better understanding of the Janus sword actions of these and other drugs might 
      yield better decisions and better outcomes.

AB  - The recently emerged novel coronavirus, "severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)", caused a highly contagious disease called coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus was first reported from Wuhan city in China in 
      December, 2019, which in less than three months spread throughout the globe and was 
      declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th of March, 
      2020. So far, the ongoing pandemic severely damaged the world's most developed 
      countries and is becoming a major threat for low- and middle-income countries. The 
      poorest continent, Africa with the most vulnerable populations to infectious 
      diseases, is predicted to be significantly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 
      outbreak. Therefore, in this review we collected and summarized the currently 
      available literature on the epidemiology, etiology, vulnerability, preparedness and 
      economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa, which could be useful and provide necessary 
      information on ongoing COVID-19 pandemics in the continent. We also briefly 
      summarized the concomitance of the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming.

AB  - COVID-19 declared as a global pandemic by WHO, has emerged as the most aggressive 
      disease, impacting more than 90% countries of the world. The virus started from a 
      single human being in China, is now increasing globally at a rate of 3% to 5% daily 
      and has become a never ending process. Some studies even predict that the virus will 
      stay with us forever. India being the second most populous country of the world, is 
      also not saved, and the virus is spreading as a community level transmitter. 
      Therefore, it become really important to analyse the possible impact of COVID-19 in 
      India and forecast how it will behave in the days to come. In present work, 
      prediction models based on genetic programming (GP) have been developed for 
      confirmed cases (CC) and death cases (DC) across three most affected states namely 
      Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi as well as whole India. The proposed prediction 
      models are presented using explicit formula, and impotence of prediction variables 
      are studied. Here, statistical parameters and metrics have been used for evaluated 
      and validate the evolved models. From the results, it has been found that the 
      proposed GEP-based models use simple linkage functions and are highly reliable for 
      time series prediction of COVID-19 cases in India.

AB  - The recent epidemic outbreak of a novel human coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 and 
      causing the respiratory tract disease COVID-19 has reached worldwide resonance and a 
      global effort is being undertaken to characterize the molecular features and 
      evolutionary origins of this virus. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of 
      pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving 
      people's lives and preventing epidemics. Additionally, general treatments, 
      coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments useful in fighting 
      COVID-19 are addressed. This review sets out to shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 and 
      host receptor recognition, a crucial factor for successful virus infection and 
      taking immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface 
      glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. A variety of improved or new approaches also have been 
      developed. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in 
      developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus 
      infection. Moreover, the genomic sequence of the virus responsible for COVID-19, as 
      well as the experimentally determined three-dimensional structure of the Main 
      protease (Mpro) is available. The reported structure of the target Mpro was 
      described in this review to identify potential drugs for COVID-19 using virtual high 
      throughput screening.

AB  - The ensuing COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented and daunting challenges to the 
      routine delivery of oncological and supportive care to patients with breast cancer. 
      Considerations include the infective risk of patients who are inherently 
      immunosuppressed from their malignancy and therapies, long-term oncological outcomes 
      from the treatment decisions undertaken during this extraordinary period, and 
      diverted healthcare resources to support a coordinated whole-of-society outbreak 
      response. In this review, we chronicle the repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak on 
      breast cancer management in Singapore and describe our approach to triaging and 
      prioritising care of breast tumours. We further propose adaptations to established 
      clinical processes and practices across the different specialties involved in breast 
      oncology, with references to the relevant evidence base or expert consensus 
      guidelines. These recommendations have been developed within the unique context of 
      Singapore's public healthcare sector. They can serve as a resource to guide breast 
      cancer management for future contingencies in this city-state, while certain 
      elements therein may be extrapolatable to other medical systems during this global 
      public health emergency.

TI  - Development of a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification as a 
      rapid early-detection method for novel SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have led researchers to study the 
      role of diagnostics in impediment of further spread and transmission. With the 
      recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the availability of rapid, sensitive, and 
      reliable diagnostic methods is essential for disease control. Hence, we have 
      developed a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) 
      assay for the specific detection of SARS-CoV-2. The primer sets for RT-LAMP assay 
      were designed to target the nucleocapsid gene of the viral RNA, and displayed a 
      detection limit of 10(2) RNA copies close to that of qRT-PCR. Notably, the assay has 
      exhibited a rapid detection span of 30âmin combined with the colorimetric 
      visualization. This test can detect specifically viral RNAs of the SARS-CoV-2 with 
      no cross-reactivity to related coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, 
      HCoV-OC43, and MERS-CoV as well as human infectious influenza viruses (type B, 
      H1N1pdm, H3N2, H5N1, H5N6, H5N8, and H7N9), and other respiratory disease-causing 
      viruses (RSVA, RSVB, ADV, PIV, MPV, and HRV). Furthermore, the developed RT-LAMP 
      assay has been evaluated using specimens collected from COVID-19 patients that 
      exhibited high agreement to the qRT-PCR. Our RT-LAMP assay is simple to perform, 
      less expensive, time-efficient, and can be used in clinical laboratories for 
      preliminary detection of SARS-CoV-2 in suspected patients. In addition to the high 
      sensitivity and specificity, this isothermal amplification conjugated with a 
      single-tube colorimetric detection method may contribute to the public health 
      responses and disease control, especially in the areas with limited laboratory 
      capacities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying changes of peripheral blood inflammatory cells (PBICs) in 
      COVID-19 patients are little known. Moreover, the risk factors for the underlying 
      changes of PBICs and their predicting role in severe COVID-19 patients remain 
      uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study including two cohorts: the 
      main cohort enrolling 45 patients of severe type serving as study group, and the 
      secondary cohort enrolling 12 patients of no-severe type serving as control group. 
      The PBICs analysis was based on blood routine and lymphocyte subsets. The 
      inflammatory cell levels were compared among patients according to clinical 
      classifications, disease-associated phases, as well as one-month outcomes. RESULTS: 
      Compared with patients of non-severe type, the patients of severe type suffered from 
      significantly decreased counts of lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, but increased 
      counts of neutrophils. These PBICs alterations got improved in recovery phase, but 
      persisted or got worse in aggravated phase. Compared with patients in discharged 
      group, the patients in un-discharged/died group suffered from decreased counts of 
      total T lymphocytes, CD4Â +Â T lymphocytes, CD8Â +Â T lymphocytes, as well as NK cells 
      at 2Â weeks after treatment. Clinical classification-critically severe was the 
      independently risk factor for lymphopenia (ORÂ =Â 7.701, 95%CI:1.265-46.893, 
      PÂ =Â 0.027), eosinopenia (ORÂ =Â 5.595, 95%CI:1.008-31.054, PÂ =Â 0.049), and worse 
      one-month outcome (ORÂ =Â 8.984; 95%CI:1.021-79.061, PÂ =Â 0.048). CONCLUSION: 
      Lymphopenia and eosinopenia may serve as predictors of disease severity and disease 
      progression in COVID-19 patients, and enhancing the cellular immunity may contribute 
      to COVID-19 treatment. Thus, PBICs might become a sentinel of COVID-19, and it 
      deserves attention during COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - We analyze the process of infection rate growth and decline for the recent global 
      pandemic, applying a new method to the available global data. We describe and 
      utilize an original approach based on statistical physics to predict the societal 
      transmission timescale and the universal recovery trajectory resulting from the 
      countermeasures implemented in entire societies. We compare the whole-society 
      infection growth rates for many countries and local regions, to illustrate the 
      common physical and mathematical basis for the viral spread and infection rate 
      reduction, and validate the theory and resulting correlations. We show that methods 
      traditionally considered for the numerical analysis and the control of individual 
      virus transmission (e.g. â(0) scaling) represent one special case of the theory, and 
      also compare our results to the available IHME computer model outcomes. We proceed 
      to illustrate several interesting features of the different approaches to the 
      mitigation of the pandemic, related to social isolation and "lockdown" tactics. 
      Finally, we use presently available data from many countries to make actual 
      predictions of the time needed for securing minimum infection rates in the future, 
      highlighting the differences that emerge between isolated "islands" and mobile 
      cities, and identifying the desired overall recovery trajectory.

AB  - COVID-19, the worst pandemic in 100 years, has rapidly spread to the entire world in 
      2 months since its early report in January 2020. Based on the publicly available 
      data sources, we developed a simple mathematic modeling approach to track the 
      outbreaks of COVID-19 in the US and three selected states: New York, Michigan and 
      California. The same approach is applicable to other regions or countries. We hope 
      our work can stimulate more effort in understanding how an outbreak is developing 
      and how big a scope it can be and in what kind of time framework. Such information 
      is critical for outbreak control, resource utilization and re-opening of the normal 
      daily life to citizens in the affected community.

AB  - Covid-19 was first reported in Morocco on March 2, 2020. Since then, to prevent its 
      propagation, the Moroccan government declared a state of health emergency. A set of 
      rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting 
      population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the 
      present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants 
      (mainly PM(10), NO(2) and SO(2)) in SalÃ© city (North-Western Morocco) during the 
      lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM(10), SO(2) and 
      NO(2) was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence 
      of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle 
      exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to 
      the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results 
      showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the 
      lockdown period were respectively 75%, 49% and 96% for PM(10), SO(2) and NO(2). 
      PM(10) levels were much less reduced than NO(2). The three-dimensional air mass 
      backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM(10) 
      local emission reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the 
      contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, 
      noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between 
      these two periods were evidenced.

AB  - The repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic for medical students are enormous and not 
      limited to the interruption of courses in medical schools and/or hospital training 
      rotations, the introduction of teaching exclusively online, postponement of 
      examinations, and of the new academic year, but extend beyond that. The mobility of 
      students within the framework of the International Federation of Medical Students' 
      Associations (IFMSA) is also strongly affected by the unexpected interruption of 
      this program and the deprivation of thousands of students worldwide of this fine 
      opportunity for training, exchange and sharing. The International Federation of 
      Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA) was founded in 1951 and currently maintains 
      135 National Member Organizations (NMOs) from 125 countries, representing a network 
      of 1.3 million medical students around the globe. Moroccan students, members of 
      IFMSA like students from other countries, are also concerned. Clinical and research 
      exchanges, carried out under the auspices of the IFMSA, allow all the students to 
      discover the health care and medical education systems of another country in a 
      different sociocultural environment. To maintain student motivation and deal with 
      the repercussions of cancelled exchanges, IFMSA could propose online training 
      programs, adapted to student needs during this period of confinement and 
      deconfinement from June to September 2020.

AB  - COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus and has played havoc on many countries 
      across the globe. A majority of the world population is now living in a restricted 
      environment for more than a month with minimal economic activities, to prevent 
      exposure to this highly infectious disease. Medical professionals are going through 
      a stressful period while trying to save the larger population. In this paper, we 
      develop two different models to capture the trend of a number of cases and also 
      predict the cases in the days to come, so that appropriate preparations can be made 
      to fight this disease. The first one is a mathematical model accounting for various 
      parameters relating to the spread of the virus, while the second one is a 
      non-parametric model based on the Fourier decomposition method (FDM), fitted on the 
      available data. The study is performed for various countries, but detailed results 
      are provided for the India, Italy, and United States of America (USA). The 
      turnaround dates for the trend of infected cases are estimated. The end-dates are 
      also predicted and are found to agree well with a very popular study based on the 
      classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Worldwide, the total number of 
      expected cases and deaths are 12.7Â ÃÂ 10(6) and 5.27Â ÃÂ 10(5), respectively, predicted 
      with data as of 06-06-2020 and 95% confidence intervals. The proposed study produces 
      promising results with the potential to serve as a good complement to existing 
      methods for continuous predictive monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In December 2019, an atypical pneumonia invaded the city of Wuhan, China, and the 
      causative agent of this disease turned out to be a new coronavirus. In January 2020, 
      the World Health Organization named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV and subsequently 
      it is referred to as SARS-CoV2 and the related disease as CoViD-19 (Lai etÂ al., 
      2020). Very quickly, the epidemic led to a pandemic and it is now a worldwide 
      emergency requiring the creation of new antiviral therapies and a related vaccine. 
      The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular 
      mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a 
      hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which 
      is the "entry receptor" for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li 
      etÂ al., 2003). A reverse engineering process uses the formalism of the Hill function 
      to represent the functions related to the dynamics of the biochemical interactions 
      of the viral infection process. Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density 
      that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they 
      provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the "time delay" given 
      by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation 
      period is predicted. The conclusion is that the density of the virus varies from the 
      "exposure time" to the "interaction time" (virus-cells). This model can be used both 
      to evaluate the infectious condition and to analyze the incubation period. 
      BACKGROUND: The ongoing threat of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2 pandemic is alarming 
      and strategies for combating infection are highly desired. This RNA virus belongs to 
      the Î²-coronavirus genus and is similar in some features to SARS-CoV. Currently, no 
      vaccine or approved medical treatment is available. The complex dynamics of the 
      rapid spread of this virus can be demonstrated with the aid of a computational 
      framework. METHODS: A mathematical model based on the principles of cell-virus 
      interaction is developed in this manuscript. The amino acid sequence of S proein and 
      its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function. 
      The mathematical model with delay is solved with the aid of numerical solvers and 
      the parametric values are obtained with the help of MCMC algorithm. RESULTS: A delay 
      differential equation model is developed to demonstrate the dynamics of target 
      cells, infected cells and the SARS-CoV2. The important parameters and coefficients 
      are demonstrated with the aid of numerical computations. The resulting thresholds 
      and forecasting may prove to be useful tools for future experimental studies and 
      control strategies. CONCLUSIONS: From the analysis, I is concluded that control 
      strategy via delay is a promising technique and the role of Hill function formalism 
      in control strategies can be better interpreted in an inexpensive manner with the 
      aid of a theoretical framework.

AB  - The paper aims to critically review past and emerging literature to help 
      professionals and researchers alike to better understand, manage and valorize both 
      the tourism impacts and transformational affordance of COVID-19. To achieve this, 
      first, the paper discusses why and how the COVID-19 can be a transformational 
      opportunity by discussing the circumstances and the questions raised by the 
      pandemic. By doing this, the paper identifies the fundamental values, institutions 
      and pre-assumptions that the tourism industry and academia should challenge and 
      break through to advance and reset the research and practice frontiers. The paper 
      continues by discussing the major impacts, behaviours and experiences that three 
      major tourism stakeholders (namely tourism demand, supply and destination management 
      organisations and policy makers) are experiencing during three COVID-19 stages 
      (response, recovery and reset). This provides an overview of the type and scale of 
      the COVID-19 tourism impacts and implications for tourism research.

AB  - This paper addresses the need for a swift transition from in person clinical 
      supervision to tele-supervision during the time of the COVID-19 global pandemic. 
      Five specific areas will be discussed in the effort to enhance the quality of 
      clinical supervision provided to couple and family therapists in training at this 
      time including: (1) COVID-19 and the structural changes and technological adaptation 
      of supervision; (2) culturally and contextually sensitive guidelines for clinical 
      supervision during COVID-19; (3) the supervisee's competence and the clinical 
      supervisory process; (4) the new set of boundaries and the supervisory role; (5) and 
      the supervisory alliance and supervisees' vulnerabilities in the face of COVID-19.

TI  - Chloroquine dosage regimens in patients with COVID-19: Safety risks and optimization 
      using simulations.
PG  - 104842
LID - 10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104842 [doi]
AB  - Currently no specific medicinal treatment exists against the new SARS-CoV2 and 
      chloroquine is widely used, since it can decrease the length of hospital stay and 
      improve the evolution of the associated COVID-19 pneumonia. However, several safety 
      concerns have been raised from chloroquine use due to the lack of essential 
      information regarding its dosing. The aim of this study is to provide a critical 
      appraisal of the safety information regarding chloroquine treatment and to apply 
      simulation techniques to unveil relationships between the observed serious adverse 
      events and overdosing, as well as to propose optimized dosage regimens. The dose 
      related adverse events of chloroquine are unveiled and maximum tolerated doses and 
      concentration levels are quoted. Among others, treatment with chloroquine can lead 
      to severe adverse effects like prolongation of the QT interval and cardiomyopathy. 
      In case of chloroquine overdosing, conditions similar to those produced by 
      SARS-CoV2, such as pulmonary oedema with respiratory insufficiency and circulatory 
      collapse, can be observed. Co-administration of chloroquine with other drugs for the 
      treatment of COVID-19 patients, like azithromycin, can further increase the risk of 
      QT prolongation and cardiomyopathy. For elder patients there is a high risk for 
      toxicity and dose reduction should be made. This study unveils the risks of some 
      widely used dosing regimens and binds the observed serious adverse events with 
      dosing. Based on simulations, safer alternative dosage regimens are proposed and 
      recommendations regarding chloroquine dosing are made.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely 
      used as an approach worldwide. Chinese Medicines (CMs) had been used to treat and 
      prevent viral infection pneumonia diseases for thousands of years and had 
      accumulated a large number of clinical experiences and effective prescriptions. AIM 
      OF THE STUDY: This research aimed to systematically excavate the classical 
      prescriptions of Chinese Medicine (CM), which have been used to prevent and treat 
      Pestilence (Wenbing, Wenyi, Shiyi or Yibing) for long history in China, to obtain 
      the potential prescriptions and ingredients to alternatively treat COVID-19. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the screening system based on data mining, 
      molecular docking and network pharmacology. Data mining and association network were 
      used to mine the high-frequency herbs and formulas from ancient prescriptions. 
      Virtual screening for the effective components of high frequency CMs and 
      compatibility Chinese Medicine was explored by a molecular docking approach. 
      Furthermore, network pharmacology method was used to preliminarily uncover the 
      molecule mechanism. RESULTS: 574 prescriptions were obtained from 96,606 classical 
      prescriptions with the key words to treat "Warm diseases (Wenbing)", "Pestilence 
      (Wenyi or Yibing)" or "Epidemic diseases (Shiyi)". Meanwhile, 40 kinds of CMs, 36 
      CMs-pairs, 6 triple-CMs-groups existed with high frequency among the 574 
      prescriptions. Additionally, the key targets of SARS-COV-2, namely 3CL hydrolase 
      (Mpro) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), were used to dock the main 
      ingredients from the 40 kinds by the LigandFitDock method. A total of 66 compounds 
      components with higher frequency were docked with the COVID-19 targets, which were 
      distributed in 26 kinds of CMs, among which Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma), 
      HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix), Dahuang (Rhei Radix Et Rhizome) and Chaihu (Bupleuri 
      Radix) contain more potential compounds. Network pharmacology results showed that 
      Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix Et Rhizoma) and HuangQin (Scutellariae Radix) CMs-pairs 
      could also interact with the targets involving in immune and inflammation diseases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results we obtained probably provided potential candidate CMs 
      formulas or active ingredients to overcome COVID-19. Prospectively, animal 
      experiment and rigorous clinic studies are needed to confirm the potential 
      preventive and treat effect of these CMs and compounds.

AB  - Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a 
      newly discovered highly pathogenic virus that was declared pandemic in March 2020 by 
      the World Health Organization. The virus affects the respiratory system, produces an 
      inflammatory storm that causes lung damage and respiratory dysfunction. It infects 
      humans of all ages. The Covid-19 takes a more severe course in individuals with 
      chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. 
      This category of persons exhibits weak immune activity and decreased levels of 
      endogenous antioxidants. Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling hormone 
      synthesized and secreted primarily by the pineal gland. It is a potent antioxidant 
      with immunomodulatory action and has remarkable anti-inflammatory effects under a 
      variety of circumstances. Regarding Covid-19 and metabolic syndrome, adequate 
      information about the relationship between these two comorbidities is required for 
      better management of these patients. Since Covid-19 infection and complications 
      involve severe inflammation and oxidative stress in people with obesity and 
      diabetes, we anticipated the inclusion of melatonin, as powerful antioxidant, within 
      proposed treatment protocols. In this context, melatonin is a potential and 
      promising agent to help overcome Covid-19 infection and boost the immune system in 
      healthy persons and obese and diabetic patients. This review summarizes some 
      evidence from recently published reports on the utility of melatonin as a potential 
      adjuvant in Covid-19-infected individuals with diabetes and obesity.

AB  - With the economic and practical limits of medical screening for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 
      coming sharply into focus worldwide, scientists are turning now to wastewater-based 
      epidemiology (WBE) as a potential tool for assessing and managing the pandemic. We 
      employed computational analysis and modeling to examine the feasibility, economy, 
      opportunities and challenges of enumerating active coronavirus infections locally 
      and globally using WBE. Depending on local conditions, detection in community 
      wastewater of one symptomatic/asymptomatic infected case per 100 to 2,000,000 
      non-infected people is theoretically feasible, with some practical successes now 
      being reported from around the world. Computer simulations for past, present and 
      emerging epidemic hotspots (e.g., Wuhan, Milan, Madrid, New York City, Teheran, 
      Seattle, Detroit and New Orleans) identified temperature, average in-sewer travel 
      time and per-capita water use as key variables. WBE surveillance of populations is 
      shown to be orders of magnitude cheaper and faster than clinical screening, yet 
      cannot fully replace it. Cost savings worldwide for one-time national surveillance 
      campaigns are estimated to be in the million to billion US dollar range (US$), 
      depending on a nation's population size and number of testing rounds conducted. For 
      resource poor regions and nations, WBE may represent the only viable means of 
      effective surveillance. Important limitations of WBE rest with its inability to 
      identify individuals and to pinpoint their specific locations. Not compensating for 
      temperature effects renders WBE data vulnerable to severe under-/over-estimation of 
      infected cases. Effective surveillance may be envisioned as a two-step process in 
      which WBE serves to identify and enumerate infected cases, where after clinical 
      testing then serves to identify infected individuals in WBE-revealed hotspots. Data 
      provided here demonstrate this approach to save money, be broadly applicable 
      worldwide, and potentially aid in precision management of the pandemic, thereby 
      helping to accelerate the global economic recovery that billions of people rely upon 
      for their livelihoods.

AB  - There is no data on patients with severe obesity who developed coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) after bariatric surgery. Four gastric bypass operations, performed 
      in a 2-week period between Feb 24 and March 4, 2020, in Tehran, Iran, were 
      complicated with COVID-19. The mean age and body mass index were 46âÂ±â12Â years and 
      49âÂ±â3Â kg/m(2). Patients developed their symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea, and 
      fatigue) 1, 2, 4, and 14Â days after surgery. One patient had unnoticed anosmia 2 
      days before surgery. Three patients were readmitted in hospital. All 4 patients were 
      treated with hydroxychloroquine. In two patients who required admission in intensive 
      care unit, other off-label therapies including antiretroviral and immunosuppressive 
      agents were also administered. All patients survived. In conclusion, COVID-19 can 
      complicate the postoperative course of patients after bariatric surgery. Correct 
      diagnosis and management in the postoperative setting would be challenging. Timing 
      of infection after surgery in our series would raise the possibility of hospital 
      transmission of COVID-19: from asymptomatic patients at the time of bariatric 
      surgery to the healthcare workers versus acquiring the COVID-19 infection by 
      non-infected patients in the perioperative period.

AB  - The objective of this study was to conduct a critical analysis of the social, 
      environmental and health risk factors in the Mexican indigenous population in the 
      context of the COVID-19 disease pandemic, and to propose strategies to mitigate the 
      impacts on these communities. Regarding social factors, we identified the return of 
      indigenous people to their communities, poor access to water, language barriers, and 
      limited access to the Internet, as factors that will not allow them to take the 
      minimum preventive measures against the disease. Additionally, environmental risk 
      factors associated with pollutants from biomass burning were identified. In health, 
      the lack of coverage in these areas and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, 
      hypertension, respiratory tract infections, and chronic pulmonary diseases were 
      identified. Some existing government programmes were identified that could be 
      supported to address these social, environmental and health gaps. We believe that 
      the best way to address these issues is to strengthen the health system with a 
      community-based approach. Health is the best element of cohesion for inserting 
      development and progress proposals in indigenous communities, given the 
      vulnerability to which they are exposed in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
      this review, all information is provided (as possible) on risk factors and potential 
      solutions in indigenous communities in the hope of providing solutions to this 
      pandemic and providing a reference for future studies.

PG  - 1259-1268
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1772678 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical 
      detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load specimens and the 
      limitations of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, 
      which results in failure to timely diagnose, cut off transmission, and assess 
      discharge criteria. To improve this situation, an optimized droplet digital PCR 
      (ddPCR) was used for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which showed that the limit of 
      detection of ddPCR is significantly lower than that of RT-PCR. We further explored 
      the feasibility of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 77 patients, and compared 
      with RT-PCR in terms of the diagnostic accuracy based on the results of follow-up 
      survey. 26 patients of COVID-19 with negative RT-PCR reports were reported as 
      positive by ddPCR. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, negative likelihood ratio 
      (NLR) and accuracy were improved from 40% (95% CI: 27-55%), 100% (95% CI: 54-100%), 
      100%, 16% (95% CI: 13-19%), 0.6 (95% CI: 0.48-0.75) and 47% (95% CI: 33-60%) for 
      RT-PCR to 94% (95% CI: 83-99%), 100% (95% CI: 48-100%), 100%, 63% (95% CI: 36-83%), 
      0.06 (95% CI: 0.02-0.18), and 95% (95% CI: 84-99%) for ddPCR, respectively. 
      Moreover, 6/14 (42.9%) convalescents were detected as positive by ddPCR at 5-12 days 
      post discharge. Overall, ddPCR shows superiority for clinical diagnosis of 
      SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negative reports, which could be a powerful 
      complement to the RT-PCR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel case of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19)-associated acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) in a patient with 
      aplastic anemia where there was early brain stem-predominant involvement. METHODS: 
      Evaluation of cause, clinical symptoms, and treatment response. RESULTS: A 
      59-year-old woman with a background of transfusion-dependent aplastic anemia 
      presented with seizures and reduced level of consciousness 10 days after the onset 
      of subjective fever, cough, and headache. Nasopharyngeal swab testing for severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was positive, and CT during 
      admission demonstrated diffuse swelling of the brain stem. She required intubation 
      and mechanical ventilation for airway protection, given her reduced level of 
      consciousness. The patient's condition deteriorated, and MRI on day 6 demonstrated 
      worsening brain stem swelling with symmetrical hemorrhagic lesions in the brain 
      stem, amygdalae, putamina, and thalamic nuclei. Appearances were consistent with 
      hemorrhagic ANE with early brain stem involvement. The patient showed no response to 
      steroid therapy and died on the eighth day of admission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may 
      be associated with an acute severe encephalopathy and, in this case, was considered 
      most likely to represent an immune-mediated phenomenon. As the pandemic continues, 
      we anticipate that the spectrum of neurologic presentation will broaden. It will be 
      important to delineate the full clinical range of emergent COVID-19-related 
      neurologic disease.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical features and death-related risk factors of 
      COVID-19. Methods: We enrolled 891 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Affiliated 
      Hospital of Jianghan University from December 2019 to February 2020, including 427 
      men and 464 women. Of the 891 cases, 582 were severe or critical, including 
      423(73%)severe and 159 (27%) critical cases. We compared the demographics, 
      laboratory findings, clinical characteristics, treatments and prognosis data of the 
      582 severe patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was 
      conducted to explore the risk factors associated with death in COVID-19 patients. 
      Results: The 582 severe patients included 293 males and 289 females, with a median 
      age of 64(range 24 to 106). Sixty-three patients died, including 45 males and 18 
      females, with a median age of 71(range 37 to 90). The average onset time of the 582 
      patients was 8 days, of whom 461 (79%) had fever, 358 (62%) dry cough, 274 (47%) 
      fatigue. There were 206 cases with shortness of breath (35%), 155 cases with 
      expectoration (27%), 83 cases with muscle pain or joint pain (14%), 71 cases with 
      diarrhea (12%), and 29 cases with headache (4%). Underlying diseases were present in 
      267 (46%) patients, most commonly hypertension (194, 33%), followed by diabetes (69, 
      12%), coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (37, 6%), tumor (18, 3%), and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (5, 1%). Chest CT showed bilateral lung involvement in 
      505 patients (87%). Upon admission, the median lymphocyte count of the 582 patients 
      was 0.8(IQR, 0.6-1.1)Ã10(9)/L, the median D-dimer was 0.5 (IQR, 0.4- 0.8) mg/L, the 
      median N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-proBNP) was 433 (IQR, 141- 
      806) pg/L, and the median creatinine was 70.3 (IQR, 56.9-87.9) Î¼mol/L. The death 
      group had a median lymphocyte count of 0.5 (0.4-0.8)Ã10(9)/L, D-dimer 1.1 
      (0.7-10.0)mg/L, N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide precursor 1479(893-5 087) 
      pg/ml, and creatinine 89.9(67.1-125.3) Î¼mol/L. Multivariate logistic analysis showed 
      that increased D-dimer (OR: 1.095, 95% CI: 1.045-1.148, P<0.001), increased 
      NT-proBNP (OR: 4.759, 95% CI: 2.437-9.291, P<0.001), and decreased lymphocyte count 
      (OR: 0.180, 95% CI: 0.059-0.550, P=0.003) were the risk factors of death in COVID-19 
      patients. Conclusions: The average onset time of severe COVID-19 was 8 days, and the 
      most common symptoms were fever, dry cough and fatigue. Comorbidities such as 
      hypertension were common and mostly accompanied by impaired organ functions on 
      admission. Higher D-dimer, higher NT-proBNP, and lower lymphocyte count were the 
      independent risk factors of death in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) Coronavirus cases are confirmed throughout the world and 
      millions of people are being put into quarantine. A better understanding of the 
      effective parameters in infection spreading can bring about a logical measurement 
      toward COVID-19. The effect of climatic factors on spreading of COVID-19 can play an 
      important role in the new Coronavirus outbreak. In this study, the main parameters, 
      including the number of infected people with COVID-19, population density, 
      intra-provincial movement, and infection days to end of the study period, average 
      temperature, average precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and average solar 
      radiation investigated to understand how can these parameters effects on COVID-19 
      spreading in Iran? The Partial correlation coefficient (PCC) and Sobol'-Jansen 
      methods are used for analyzing the effect and correlation of variables with the 
      COVID-19 spreading rate. The result of sensitivity analysis shows that the 
      population density, intra-provincial movement have a direct relationship with the 
      infection outbreak. Conversely, areas with low values of wind speed, humidity, and 
      solar radiation exposure to a high rate of infection that support the virus's 
      survival. The provinces such as Tehran, Mazandaran, Alborz, Gilan, and Qom are more 
      susceptible to infection because of high population density, intra-provincial 
      movements and high humidity rate in comparison with Southern provinces.

TI  - Who complies with the restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19?: Personality 
      and perceptions of the COVID-19 situation.

AB  - In 2020, many countries around the world created and enforced heavy restrictions 
      geared towards reducing the spread of the coronavirus (i.e., COVID-19). In this 
      study (NÂ =Â 263), we examined the role of personality traits (i.e., Big Five and Dark 
      Triad) and individual differences in perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic situation 
      (the situational eight: Duty, Intellect, Adversity, Mating, Positivity, Negativity, 
      Deception, and Sociality) in accounting for individual differences in compliance 
      with the governmental restrictions in Poland. We found that the way people perceived 
      the situation explained more variance in compliance than personality traits which is 
      in accordance with the hypothesis that strong situations, such as the COVID-19 
      pandemic, leave less room for dispositional tendencies in predicting behaviors than 
      situational cues. Moreover, people scoring low on agreeableness and high on aspects 
      of the Dark Triad traits (i.e., Machiavellianism, psychopathy Factor 1, and 
      narcissistic rivalry) were less likely to comply with the restrictions. 
      Additionally, we replicated and extended what is known about the associations 
      between personality and individual differences in the perception of situations when 
      the latter were assessed in relation to a strong situation and the former were 
      assessed with long and multidimensional measures.

TI  - COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: how one pandemic worsens the other.
LID - 10.1007/s11154-020-09573-6 [doi]
AB  - In light of the most challenging public health crisis of modern history, COVID-19 
      mortality continues to rise at an alarming rate. Patients with co-morbidities such 
      as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM) seem to be more 
      prone to severe symptoms and appear to have a higher mortality rate. In this review, 
      we elucidate suggested mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of 
      patients with diabetes to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe COVID-19 
      disease. The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a 
      facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host's receptor angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2 (ACE2). It can also be associated with a higher basal level of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines present in patients with diabetes, which enables a 
      hyperinflammatory "cytokine storm" in response to the virus. This review also 
      suggests a link between elevated levels of IL-6 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and 
      their role in exacerbating diabetes-induced complications and insulin resistance. If 
      further studied, these findings could help identify novel therapeutic intervention 
      strategies for patients with diabetes comorbid with COVID-19.

AB  - Despite initial findings indicating that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically 
      related belonging to the same virus species and that the two viruses used the same 
      entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), our data demonstrated that 
      there is no detectable cross-neutralization by SARS patient sera against SARS-CoV-2. 
      We also found that there are significant levels of neutralizing antibodies in 
      recovered SARS patients 9-17 years after initial infection. These findings will be 
      of significant use in guiding the development of serologic tests, formulating 
      convalescent plasma therapy strategies, and assessing the longevity of protective 
      immunity for SARS-related coronaviruses in general as well as vaccine efficacy.

      future accelerated viral infectivity similar to COVID.

AB  - This study has two goals. The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants 
      of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 that is generating a high level of deaths. 
      The second is to suggest a strategy to cope with future epidemic threats similar to 
      COVID-19 having an accelerated viral infectivity in society. Using data on sample of 
      NÂ =Â 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 
      7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in 
      North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days 
      exceeding the limits set for PM(10) (particulate matter 10Â Î¼m or less in diameter) 
      or ozone. In particular, hinterland cities with average high number of days 
      exceeding the limits set for PM(10) (and also having a low wind speed) have a very 
      high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean is about 2200 
      infected individuals, with average polluted days greater than 80 days per year), 
      whereas coastal cities also having days exceeding the limits set for PM(10) or ozone 
      but with high wind speed have about 944.70 average infected individuals, with about 
      60 average polluted days per year; moreover, cities having more than 100Â days of air 
      pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM(10)), they have a very high average 
      number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas 
      cities having less than 100Â days of air pollution per year, they have a lower 
      average number of infected people (about 1014 individuals). The findings here also 
      suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max 
      number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals or similar industrialized 
      cities can exceed the limits set for PM(10) or for ozone, considering their 
      meteorological conditions, is about 48Â days. Moreover, results here reveal that the 
      explanatory variable of air pollution in cities seems to be a more important 
      predictor in the initial phase of diffusion of viral infectivity (on 17th March 
      2020, b(1)Â =Â 1.27, pÂ <Â 0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b(2)Â =Â 0.31, pÂ <Â 0.05). 
      In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air 
      pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b'(1)Â =Â 0.81, pÂ <Â 0.001) also 
      because of the indirect effect of lockdown, whereas regression coefficient of 
      transmission based on interpersonal contacts has a stable level (b'(2)Â =Â 0.31, 
      pÂ <Â 0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is 
      due to mainly to the mechanism of "air pollution-to-human transmission" (airborne 
      viral infectivity) rather than "human-to-human transmission". Overall, then, 
      transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic 
      causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological 
      characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are 
      different for each region and/or city (e.g., complex interaction between air 
      pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral 
      infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, 
      etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study here suggest that a proactive 
      strategy to cope with future epidemics is also to apply especially an environmental 
      and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in 
      hinterland and polluting cities- (having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture 
      and number of fog days) -that seem to have an environment that foster a fast 
      transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of 
      polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air 
      pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must 
      conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to 
      COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is 
      also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in 
      terms of biology, medicine, healthcare and health sector.

AB  - Stone quarrying and crushing spits huge stone dust to the environment and causes 
      threats to ecosystem components as well as human health. Imposing emergency lockdown 
      to stop infection of COVID 19 virus on 24.03.2020 in India has created economic 
      crisis but it has facilitated environment to restore its quality. Global scale study 
      has already proved the qualitative improvement of air quality but its possible 
      impact at regional level is not investigated yet. Middle catchment of Dwarka river 
      basin of Eastern India is well known for stone quarrying and crushing and therefore 
      the region is highly polluted. The present study has attempted to explore the impact 
      of forced lockdown on environmental components like Particulate matter (PM) 10, Land 
      surface temperature (LST), river water quality, noise using image and field derived 
      data in pre and during lockdown periods. Result clearly exhibits that Maximum PM(10) 
      concentration was 189 to 278 Î¼g/m(3) in pre lockdown period and it now ranges from 
      50 to 60Â Î¼g/m(3) after 18Â days of the commencement of lockdown in selected four 
      stone crushing clusters. LST is reduced by 3-5 Â°C, noise level is dropped to <65dBA 
      which was above 85dBA in stone crusher dominated areas in pre lockdown period. 
      Adjacent river water is qualitatively improved due to stoppage of dust release to 
      the river. For instance, total dissolve solid (TDS) level in river water adjacent to 
      crushing unit is attenuated by almost two times. When entire world is worried about 
      the appropriate policies for abating environmental pollution, this emergency 
      lockdown shows an absolute way i.e. pollution source management may restore 
      environment and ecosystem with very rapid rate.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has become a severe public health 
      issue. The novelty of the virus prompts a search for understanding of how ecological 
      factors affect the transmission and survival of the virus. Several studies have 
      robustly identified a relationship between temperature and the number of cases. 
      However, there is no specific study for a tropical climate such as Brazil. This work 
      aims to determine the relationship of temperature to COVID-19 infection for the 
      state capital cities of Brazil. Cumulative data with the daily number of confirmed 
      cases was collected from February 27 to April 1, 2020, for all 27 state capital 
      cities of Brazil affected by COVID-19. A generalized additive model (GAM) was 
      applied to explore the linear and nonlinear relationship between annual average 
      temperature compensation and confirmed cases. Also, a polynomial linear regression 
      model was proposed to represent the behavior of the growth curve of COVID-19 in the 
      capital cities of Brazil. The GAM dose-response curve suggested a negative linear 
      relationship between temperatures and daily cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 
      in the range from 16.8Â Â°C to 27.4Â Â°C. Each 1Â Â°C rise of temperature was associated 
      with a -4.8951% (tÂ =Â -2.29, pÂ =Â 0.0226) decrease in the number of daily cumulative 
      confirmed cases of COVID-19. A sensitivity analysis assessed the robustness of the 
      results of the model. The predicted R-squared of the polynomial linear regression 
      model was 0.81053. In this study, which features the tropical temperatures of 
      Brazil, the variation in annual average temperatures ranged from 16.8Â Â°C to 27.4Â Â°C. 
      Results indicated that temperatures had a negative linear relationship with the 
      number of confirmed cases. The curve flattened at a threshold of 25.8Â Â°C. There is 
      no evidence supporting that the curve declined for temperatures above 25.8Â Â°C. The 
      study had the goal of supporting governance for healthcare policymakers.

AB  - Since December 2019, the coronovirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted 
      in more than 2,160,000 positive cases and more than 145,000 deaths until April 18, 
      2020. The pressure to the health services worldwide has been unprecedented. The 
      redeployment of staff and resources to treat more efficiently COVID-19 cases along 
      with the need to reduce disease transmission has affected the field of 
      electrophysiology among many others. Amendments to clinical pathways are obligatory 
      in this perspective to continue to provide the necessary health services to the 
      people who need them, although at the same time, infection control and prevention 
      are not compromised by inadvertent disease transmission or unnecessary use of 
      resources. We aim to provide a guide of the logistic aspects of electrophysiology 
      procedures derived from our tertiary cardiac center during the current COVID-19 
      pandemic.

LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1775133 [doi]
AB  - During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, logistic problems 
      associated with specimen collection limited the SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially in 
      the community. In this study, we assessed the use of posterior oropharyngeal saliva 
      as specimens for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in an automated point-of-care molecular 
      assay. Archived nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva 
      specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients were tested with the Xpert(Â®) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 
      assay. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either NPS or saliva specimens of all patients. 
      Among them, 84.5% (49/58) tested positive in both NPS and saliva, 10.3% (6/58) 
      tested positive in NPS only, and 5.2% (3/58) tested positive in saliva only. No 
      significant difference in the detection rate was observed between NPS and saliva 
      (McNemar's test pâ=â0.5078). The detection rate was slightly higher for N2 (NPS 
      94.8% and Saliva 93.1%) than that of the E gene target (Saliva: 89.7% vs 82.8%) on 
      both specimen types. Significantly earlier median Ct value was observed for NPS 
      comparing to that of saliva on both E (26.8 vs 29.7, pâ=â0.0002) and N2 gene target 
      (29.3 vs 32.3, pâ=â0.0002). The median Ct value of E gene target was significantly 
      earlier than that of the N2 gene target for both NPS (26.8 vs 29.3, pâ<â0.0001) and 
      saliva (29.7 vs 32.3, pâ<â0.0001). In conclusion, posterior oropharyngeal saliva and 
      NPS were found to have similar detection rates in the point-of-care test for 
      SARS-CoV-2 detection. Since posterior oropharyngeal saliva can be collected easily, 
      the use of saliva as an alternative specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 detection is 
      recommended.

AB  - For the first time in Homo sapiens history, possibly, most of human activities is 
      stopped by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Nearly eight billion people of this 
      world are facing a great challenge, maybe not "to be or not to be" yet, but 
      unpredictable. What happens to other major pandemics in the past, and how human 
      beings went through these hurdles? The human body is equipped with the immune system 
      that can recognize, respond and fight against pathogens such as viruses. Following 
      the innate response, immune system processes the adaptive response by which each 
      pathogen is encoded and recorded in memory system. The humoral reaction containing 
      cytokines and antibodies is expected to activate when the pathogens come back. 
      Exploiting this nature of body protection, neutralizing antibodies have been 
      investigated. Learning from past, in parallel to SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses 
      SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who caused previous pandemics, are recalled in this review. We 
      here propose insights of origin and characteristics and perspective for the future 
      of antibodies development.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the XXI 
      century. In this opinionated review, we underscore the crucial role of biosensing to 
      handle with such situations. As a matter of fact, testing accelerates life-saving 
      decisions on treatment and isolation of COVID-19 patients in an early stage, and 
      thereby, decelerating or even preventing the spread of such emerging infectious 
      diseases. Meanwhile, it is also proven that a timely and broad application of 
      testing leads to lower mortality rates in countries like Germany or South Korea. 
      Besides, biosensors are also powerful tools for effective assessment of clinical 
      progress and to provide alertness on severity or critical trends of infection. In 
      view hereof, we critically discuss the state-of-the-art biosensing devices for 
      COVID-19 testing. We spot the urgent needs and highlight innovative diagnostic 
      approaches for targeting various COVID-19 related biomarkers. Finally, we outline 
      our recommendations on biosensors and biosensing-related issues towards pandemic 
      outbreaks.

AB  - Since its outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province China, 2019-coronavirus infected disease 
      (COVID-19) had been widely spread all over the world, the control of which calls for 
      a better understanding of its epidemiology and clinical characteristics. We included 
      12 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University from 
      23 January 2020 to 11 February 2020, which were retrospectively analyzed for 
      epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features. All 
      the patients were confirmed by nucleic acid detection, the average age of whom was 
      45.25Â years (range, 23-79Â years). Most patients had a history of Wuhan traveling or 
      had contact with Wuhan travelers or infected cases. Obvious family cluster was 
      observed. Clinical manifestations included fever (12/12), fatigue (10/12), cough 
      (6/12), sore throat (4/12), headache (3/12), and diarrhea (2/12). Only three out of 
      eight patients had pneumonia manifestation on radiography. Most patients had a 
      normal white blood cell (WBC) count and normal or reduced lymphocyte (LY) count. 
      Pneumonia changes were observed in all the four patients who underwent a chest CT 
      scan. Only one elderly patient developed severe pneumonia, while all the rest were 
      mild disease and had a self-limiting course.

AB  - A newly emerged coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused severe pneumonia outbreaks in China 
      in December 2019 and has since spread to various countries around the world. To 
      trace the evolution route and probe the transmission dynamics of this virus, we 
      performed phylodynamic analysis of 247 high quality genomic sequences available in 
      the GISAID platform as of 5 March 2020. Among them, four genetic clusters, defined 
      as super-spreaders (SSs), could be identified and were found to be responsible for 
      the major outbreaks that subsequently occurred in various countries. SS1 was widely 
      disseminated in Asia and the US, and mainly responsible for outbreaks in the states 
      of Washington and California as well as South Korea, whereas SS4 contributed to the 
      pandemic in Europe. Using the signature mutations of each SS as markers, we further 
      analysed 1539 genome sequences reported after 29 February 2020 and found that 90% of 
      these genomes belonged to SSs, with SS4 being the most dominant. The relative degree 
      of contribution of each SS to the pandemic in different continents was also 
      depicted. Identification of these super-spreaders greatly facilitates development of 
      new strategies to control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - In this paper, Deep Learning-based models are used for predicting the number of 
      novel coronavirus (COVID-19) positive reported cases for 32 states and union 
      territories of India. Recurrent neural network (RNN) based long-short term memory 
      (LSTM) variants such as Deep LSTM, Convolutional LSTM and Bi-directional LSTM are 
      applied on Indian dataset to predict the number of positive cases. LSTM model with 
      minimum error is chosen for predicting daily and weekly cases. It is observed that 
      the proposed method yields high accuracy for short term prediction with error less 
      than 3% for daily predictions and less than 8% for weekly predictions. Indian states 
      are categorised into different zones based on the spread of positive cases and daily 
      growth rate for easy identification of novel coronavirus hot-spots. Preventive 
      measures to reduce the spread in respective zones are also suggested. A website is 
      created where the state-wise predictions are updated using the proposed model for 
      authorities,researchers and planners. This study can be applied by other countries 
      for predicting COVID-19 cases at the state or national level.

AB  - In the first two decades of the 21st century, there have been three outbreaks of 
      severe respiratory infections caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) 
      around the world: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) by the SARS-CoV in 
      2002-2003, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) by the MERS-CoV in June 2012, 
      and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the SARS-CoV-2 presently affecting most 
      countries In all of these, fatalities are a consequence of a multiorgan 
      dysregulation caused by pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and circulatory damage; however, 
      COVID patients may show significant neurological signs and symptoms such as 
      headache, nausea, vomiting, and sensory disturbances, the most prominent being 
      anosmia and ageusia. The neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at 
      least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed 
      in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the 
      available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of CoVs-induced 
      CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating 
      acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. We consider that 
      a widespread awareness of the significant neurotropism of CoVs might contribute to 
      an earlier recognition of the signs and symptoms of viral-induced CNS damage. 
      Moreover, a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which 
      CoVs affect CNS function and cause CNS damage could help in planning new strategies 
      for prognostic evaluation and targeted therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory therapies for pericardial diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic: 
      safety and potentiality.
PG  - 625-629
LID - 10.2459/JCM.0000000000001059 [doi]
AB  - : The COVID-19 pandemic is challenging our cardiovascular care of patients with 
      heart diseases. In the setting of pericardial diseases, there are two possible 
      different scenarios to consider: the patient being treated for pericarditis who 
      subsequently becomes infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the patient with COVID-19 who 
      develops pericarditis or pericardial effusion. In both conditions, clinicians may be 
      doubtful regarding the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
      corticosteroids, colchicine, and biological agents, such as anti-IL1 agents (e.g. 
      anakinra), that are the mainstay of therapy for pericarditis.For NSAIDs, there is no 
      clear scientific evidence linking ibuprofen and other NSAIDs to worsening of 
      COVID-19; however, it seems prudent to continue them, if necessary to control 
      pericarditis, and on the other hand, to prefer paracetamol for fever and systemic 
      symptoms related to COVID-19. Treatments with corticosteroids, colchicine, and 
      anakinra appear well tolerated in the context of COVID-19 infection and are 
      currently actively evaluated as potential therapeutic options for COVID infection at 
      different stages of the disease. On this basis, currently most treatments for 
      pericarditis do not appear contraindicated also in the presence of possible COVID-19 
      infection and should not be discontinued, and some (corticosteroids, colchicine, and 
      anakinra) can be considered to treat both conditions.

AB  - Different primers/probes sets have been developed all over the world for the nucleic 
      acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qRT-PCR) as a standard method. In our recent study, we explored the feasibility of 
      droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for clinical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection compared 
      with qRT-PCR using the same primer/probe sets issued by Chinese Center for Disease 
      Control and Prevention (CDC) targeting viral ORF1ab or N gene, which showed that 
      ddPCR could largely minimize the false negatives reports resulted by qRT-PCR [Suo T, 
      Liu X, Feng J, et al. ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 
      detection in low viral load specimens. medRxiv [Internet]. 2020;2020.02.29.20029439. 
      Available from: 
      https://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/03/06/2020.02.29.20029439.abstract]. Here, we 
      further stringently compared the performance of qRT-PCR and ddPCR for 8 primer/probe 
      sets with the same clinical samples and conditions. Results showed that none of 8 
      primer/probe sets used in qRT-PCR could significantly distinguish true negatives and 
      positives with low viral load (10(-4) dilution). Moreover, false positive reports of 
      qRT-PCR with UCDC-N1, N2 and CCDC-N primers/probes sets were observed. In contrast, 
      ddPCR showed significantly better performance in general for low viral load samples 
      compared to qRT-PCR. Remarkably, the background readouts of ddPCR are relatively 
      lower, which could efficiently reduce the production of false positive reports.

AB  - We formulate a deterministic epidemic model for the spread of Corona Virus Disease 
      (COVID-19). We have included asymptomatic, quarantineÂ andÂ isolation compartments in 
      the model, as studies have stressed upon the importance of these population groups 
      on the transmission of the disease. We calculate the basic reproduction number 
      [Formula: see text] and show that for [Formula: see text] the disease dies out and 
      for [Formula: see text] the disease is endemic. Using sensitivity analysis we 
      establish that [Formula: see text] is most sensitive to the rate of quarantine and 
      isolation and that a high level of quarantine needs to be maintained as well as 
      isolation to control the disease. Based on this we devise optimal quarantine and 
      isolation strategies, noting that high levels need to be maintained during the early 
      stages of the outbreak. Using data from the Wuhan outbreak, which has nearly run its 
      course we estimate that [Formula: see text] which while in agreement with other 
      estimates in the literature is on the lower side.

AB  - In December 2019, COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. The current study aimed to 
      explore the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 complicated by hypertension. In 
      this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 110 discharged patients with 
      COVID-19 at Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 25 to February 20, 
      2020. All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of 
      hypertension. Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried 
      out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 
      57.7Â years (range, 25-86Â years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main 
      underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. 
      Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly 
      lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96Â ÃÂ 10(9)/L vs 1.26Â ÃÂ 10(9)/L), 
      and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in 
      the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or 
      ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5Â years vs 
      69.2Â years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 
      (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 
      (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a 
      significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities 
      such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in 
      patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of 
      COVID-19 patients with hypertension.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel human-infecting coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in 
      China. In a few months, SARS-CoV-2 has caused thousands of disease cases and deaths 
      in several countries. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that SARS-CoV-2 clusters with 
      SARS-CoV in the Sarbecovirus subgenus and viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 were 
      identified from bats and pangolins. Coronaviruses have long and complex genomes with 
      high plasticity in terms of gene content. To date, the coding potential of 
      SARS-CoV-2 remains partially unknown. We thus used available sequences of bat and 
      pangolin viruses to determine the selective events that shaped the genome structure 
      of SARS-CoV-2 and to assess its coding potential. By searching for signals of 
      significantly reduced variability at synonymous sites (dS), we identified six 
      genomic regions, one of these corresponding to the programmed -1 ribosomal 
      frameshift. The most prominent signal of dS reduction was observed within the E 
      gene. A genome-wide analysis of conserved RNA structures indicated that this region 
      harbors a putative functional RNA element that is shared with the SARS-CoV lineage. 
      Additional signals of reduced dS indicated the presence of internal ORFs. Whereas 
      the presence ORF9a (internal to N) was previously proposed by homology with a well 
      characterized protein of SARS-CoV, ORF3h (for hypothetical, within ORF3a) was not 
      previously described. The predicted product of ORF3h has 90% identity with the 
      corresponding predicted product of SARS-CoV and displays features suggestive of a 
      viroporin. Finally, analysis of the putative ORF10 revealed high dN/dS (3.82) in 
      SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. In the SARS-CoV lineage, the ORF is predicted 
      to encode a truncated protein and is neutrally evolving. These data suggest that 
      ORF10 encodes a functional protein in SARS-CoV-2 and that positive selection is 
      driving its evolution. Experimental analyses will be necessary to validate and 
      characterize the coding and non-coding functional elements we identified.

TI  - Drinking to cope with the pandemic: The unique associations of COVID-19-related

AB  - The 2019 Coronavirus pandemic has brought about significant and unprecedented 
      changes to the modern world, including stay-at-home orders, high rates of 
      unemployment, and more than a hundred thousand deaths across the United States. 
      Derived from the self-medication hypothesis, this research explored how perceived 
      threat and psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic are associated 
      with drinking behavior among an American sample of adults. We also evaluated whether 
      links between COVID-19-related perceived threat and psychological distress with 
      drinking behavior are different for men and women. Participants (NÂ =Â 754; 50% women) 
      completed an online Qualtrics Panels study between April 17th and 23rd, 2020. 
      Results suggested that psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic was 
      consistently related to alcohol use indices, and moderation results indicated this 
      pattern was significant only among women for number of drinks consumed during the 
      recent heaviest drinking occasion and number of drinks consumed on a typical 
      evening. COVID-related distress' link to frequency of drinking and heavy drinking 
      episodes was not different for men and women. Our results suggest that continued 
      monitoring, particularly among women, should be conducted as this pandemic continues 
      to evolve to identify the long-term public health impacts of drinking to cope with 
      COVID-19 distress.

TI  - Rapid response in the COVID-19 pandemic: a Delphi study from the European Pediatric 
      Dialysis Working Group.
PG  - 1669-1678
LID - 10.1007/s00467-020-04584-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a global health emergency. Since children are less 
      than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based 
      practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert 
      knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was 
      conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric 
      Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were 
      analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were 
      identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (nâ=â4), changes 
      in use of current therapeutics (nâ=â3), preventive measurements of transmission and 
      management of COVID-19 (nâ=â3), and changes in standard clinical care (nâ=â3). 
      Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to 
      availability of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As limited quantitative evidence is 
      available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative 
      expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi 
      exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established 
      network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to 
      COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis. Such rapid sharing of 
      knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for 
      medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems 
      such as those of Europe and the US.

AB  - Coronaviruses cause severe human viral diseases including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. 
      Most recently SARS-CoV-2 virus (causing COVID-19) has led to a pandemic with no 
      successful therapeutics. The SARS-CoV-2 infection relies on trimeric spike (S) 
      proteins to facilitate virus entry into host cells by binding to ACE2 receptor on 
      host cell membranes. Therefore, blocking this interaction with antibodies are 
      promising agents against SARS-CoV-2. Here we describe using humanized llama antibody 
      VHHs against SARS-CoV-2 that would overcome the limitations associated with 
      polyclonal and monoclonal combination therapies. From two llama VHH libraries, 
      unique humanized VHHs that bind to S protein and block the S/ACE2 interaction were 
      identified. Furthermore, pairwise combination of VHHs showed synergistic blocking. 
      Multi-specific antibodies with enhanced affinity and avidity, and improved S/ACE2 
      blocking are currently being developed using an in-silico approach that also fuses 
      VHHs to Fc domains. Importantly, our current bi-specific antibody shows potent 
      S/ACE2 blocking (KD - 0.25 nM, IC100ââ¼â36.7ânM, IC95ââ¼â12.2ânM, IC50ââ¼â1ânM) which 
      is significantly better than individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Overall, this design 
      would equip the VHH-Fcs multiple mechanisms of actions against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we 
      aim to contribute to the battle against COVID-19 by developing therapeutic 
      antibodies as well as diagnostics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We observe changes of the main lymphocyte subsets 
      (CD16(+)CD56ãCD19ãCD3ãCD4ãand CD8) in COVID-19-infected patients and explore whether 
      the changes are associated with disease severity. METHODS: One-hundred and 
      fifty-four cases of COVID-19-infected patients were selected and divided into 3 
      groups (moderate group, severe group and critical group). The flow cytometry assay 
      was performed to examine the numbers of lymphocyte subsets. RESULTS: CD3(+), CD4(+) 
      and CD8Â +Â T lymphocyte subsets were decreased in COVID-19-infected patients. 
      Compared with the moderate group and the sever group, CD3(+), CD4(+) and CD8(+) T 
      cells in the critical group decreased greatly (PÂ <Â 0.001, PÂ =Â 0.005 or PÂ =Â 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Reduced CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts may reflect the 
      severity of the COVID-19. Monitoring T cell changes has important implications for 
      the diagnosis and treatment of severe patients who may become critically ill.

AB  - Taiwan experienced two waves of imported infections with Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). This study aimed at investigating the genomic variation of severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Taiwan and compared their 
      evolutionary trajectories with the global strains. We performed culture and 
      full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains followed by phylogenetic analysis. A 
      382-nucleotides deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was found in a Taiwanese 
      strain isolated from a patient on February 4, 2020 who had a travel history to 
      Wuhan. Patients in the first wave also included several sporadic, local transmission 
      cases. Genomes of 5 strains sequenced from clustered infections were classified into 
      a new clade with ORF1ab-V378I mutation, in addition to 3 dominant clades ORF8-L84S, 
      ORF3a-G251V and S-D614G. This highlighted clade also included some strains isolated 
      from patients who had a travel history to Turkey and Iran. The second wave mostly 
      resulted from patients who had a travel history to Europe and Americas. All 
      Taiwanese viruses were classified into various clades. Genomic surveillance of 
      SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan revealed a new ORF8-deletion mutant and a virus clade that may 
      be associated with infections in the Middle East, which contributed to a better 
      understanding of the global SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is causing wide-spread interruptions in 
      medical education. With little warning, clinical rotations were cancelled and 
      medical students were sent home. While pre-clinical students transitioned to online 
      curricula, clinical students were left without discreet educational goals. 
      Simultaneously, medical doctors were scrambling to maintain competence in the face 
      of rapidly evolving COVID-19 information. Here, we describe an education program 
      that integrates medical students into interdisciplinary teams to review emerging 
      COVID-19 research that directly answers questions sent in by medical doctors.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has become the largest pandemic that has affected 210 
      countries. Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, 
      from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or 
      vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via 
      lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is 
      observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made 
      the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move 
      are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. 
      Many environmental indices such as lowering NO(2) and CO(2) emissions and reduction 
      in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean 
      air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was 
      experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including 
      urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a 
      special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. 
      Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via 
      introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an 
      outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is 
      still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with 
      aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, 
      temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, 
      therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly 
      recommended. However, the self-revival rate of nature shall continue during 
      post-lockdown period and a master plan must be adapted by national and international 
      (mostly political) bodies to revive the Mother Nature completely.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization characterized the Coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) as a pandemic on March 11th. Many clinical trials on COVID-19 have been 
      registered, and we aim to review the study characteristics and provide guidance for 
      future trials to avoid duplicated effort. METHODS: Studies on COVID-19 registered 
      before March 3rd, 2020 on eight registry platforms worldwide were searched and the 
      data of design, participants, interventions, and outcomes were extracted and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-three studies were identified and 380 
      (96.7%) were from mainland China, while 3 in Japan, 3 in France, 2 in the US, and 3 
      were international collaborative studies. Two hundred and sixty-six (67.7%) aimed at 
      therapeutic effect, others were for prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, etc. Two 
      hundred and two studies (51.4%) were randomized controlled trials. Two third of 
      therapeutic studies tested Western medicines including antiviral drugs (17.7%), stem 
      cell and cord blood therapy (10.2%), chloroquine and derivatives (8.3%), 16 (6.0%) 
      on Chinese medicines, and 73 (27.4%) on integrated therapy of Western and Chinese 
      medicines. Thirty-one studies among 266 therapeutic studies (11.7%) used mortality 
      as primary outcome, while the most designed secondary outcomes were symptoms and 
      signs (47.0%). Half of the studies (45.5%) had not started recruiting till March 
      3rd. CONCLUSION: Inappropriate outcome setting, delayed recruitment and insufficient 
      numbers of new cases in China implied many studies may fail to complete. Strategies 
      and protocols of the studies with robust and rapid data sharing are warranted for 
      emergency public health events, helping the timely evidence-based decision-making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) has been spreading 
      worldwide, and tracking laboratory indexes during the diagnosis and treatment of 
      patients with severe COVID-19 can provide a reference for patients in other 
      countries and regions. METHODS: We closely tracked the epidemiological history, 
      diagnosis and treatment process, as well as dynamic changes in routine blood 
      indicators, of a severe COVID-19 patient who was hospitalized for 26Â days. RESULTS: 
      Our study found that the patient's condition worsened in the first week after 
      admission, white blood cells (WBCs), neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
      eosinophils, red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), 
      platelets (PLT) and platelet lymphocyte ratio (PLR) decreased. On the 7th day of 
      admission, the levels of these cells decreased to their lowest values, though the 
      red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level remained 
      at high values. From 8 to 14Â days of admission, the patient's condition improved, 
      hypoxemia was corrected, and mechanical ventilation was discontinued. The number of 
      WBCs, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and lymphocytes increased gradually, and 
      the erythrocyte parameters stopped declining and stabilized in a certain range; CRP 
      decreased rapidly. On the 20th day of admission, the nucleic acid test was negative, 
      WBC, neutrophil, CRP, NLR and PLR decreased gradually, and monocyte, lymphocyte, and 
      eosinophil counts increased. Although RBCs and hemoglobin (Hb) levels continued to 
      decrease, RDW gradually increased, indicating the recovery of hematopoiesis. In 
      addition, it should be noted that monocytes and eosinophils were at extremely low 
      levels within 10Â days after admission; the recovery time of eosinophils was 
      approximately 12Â days after admission, which was earlier than other parameters, 
      which might be of great value in judging the progress of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Dynamic changes in routine blood parameters might be helpful for the prognosis of 
      COVID-19 patients and evaluation of the treatment effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive 
      symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. METHOD: To provide a 
      preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the 
      current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult 
      individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official 
      lockdown was established across the country. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of the 
      sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet 
      and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of 
      lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a 
      routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity 
      to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors 
      of lower levels of depressive symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Cross-sectional nature and use 
      of sample of convenience. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that "simple" coping 
      behaviors may protect against anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 
      pandemic and lockdown.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned against the use of Hydroxychloroquine 
      or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital or a clinical trial setting due to 
      the risk of QT interval prolongation, ventricular tachycardia and the increased risk 
      of these complications when combined with some antibiotics such as azithromycin. 
      Several studies have reported no benefit of Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when 
      used alone or with a macrolide in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Despite these 
      warnings, in several developing countries the official guidelines for treatment of 
      Covid-19 patients at the primary care level recommend Hydroxychloroquine and 
      azithromycin, among other treatments, as the first-choice for mild symptomatic 
      Covid-19 patients, asymptomatic contacts or for prophylaxis. In our opinion there is 
      a primum non nocere dilemma during this Covid-19 pandemic. In order to solve this 
      bioethical problem, we strongly recommend that a randomized controlled trial in a 
      primary care setting be carried out as a matter of urgency in these areas of the 
      world.

AB  - The morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is reaching 3 Million landmark causing and a 
      serious public health concern globally and it is enigmatic how several antiviral and 
      antibody treatments were not effective in the different period across the globe. 
      With the drastic increasing number of positive cases around the world WHO raised the 
      importance in the assessment of the risk of spread and understanding genetic 
      modifications that could have occurred in the SARS-CoV-2. Using all available deep 
      sequencing data of complete genome from all over the world (NCBI repository), we 
      identified several hundreds of point mutations or SNPs in SARS-CoV-2 all across the 
      genome. This could be the cause for the constant change and differed virulence with 
      an increase in mortality and morbidity. Among the 12 different countries (one 
      sequence from each country) with complete genome sequencing data, we noted the 47 
      key point mutations or SNPs located along the entire genome that might have impact 
      in the virulence and response to different antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. In this 
      regard, key viral proteins of spike glycoprotein, Nsp1, RdRp and the ORF8 region got 
      heavily mutated within these 3 months via person-to-person passage. We also discuss 
      what could be the possible cause of this rapid mutation in the SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - In the absence of a vaccine the medical and scientific community is looking 
      intensely at utilizing a pre or post exposure drug that could decrease viremia. The 
      search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of 
      any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of 
      SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the 
      approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all 
      interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one 
      repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, 
      some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 
      prophylaxis around the world. Among the included studies, all but three were 
      randomized and parallel and most of them (74%, 23/31) were double-blinded to 
      quadruple-blinded studies. We found a great diversity in dosing and nearly all the 
      possible scientifically reasonable regimens are under evaluation. This diversity 
      offers benefits as well as challenges. Importantly, the final analysis of these 
      trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regard to the 
      clinical design, it will be crucial to carefully read and evaluate the results of 
      each study in regards to the clinical design rather than quickly glancing a 140 
      characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug 
      against a disease.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the practice medicine on a global 
      scale during the year 2020. With fewer patients presenting to hospitals with the 
      diagnosis of STEMI, healthcare workers are wondering what is causing this decline. 
      This piece presents data from two medical centers and addresses several possible 
      causes to explain this phenomenon. It was found that there was a statistically 
      significant decrease from January to March 2020 in number of presenting STEMI 
      diagnoses.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze how meteorological conditions such as temperature, 
      humidity and rainfall can affect the spread of COVID-19 in five Brazilian (SÃ£o 
      Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, BrasÃ­lia, Manaus and Fortaleza) cities. The cities selected 
      were those with the largest number of confirmed cases considering data of April 13. 
      Variables such as number of cumulative cases, new daily cases and contamination rate 
      were employed for this study. Our results showed that higher mean temperatures and 
      average relative humidity favored the COVID-19 transmission, differently from 
      reports from coldest countries or periods of time under cool temperatures. Thus, 
      considering the results obtained, intersectoral policies and actions are necessary, 
      mainly in cities where the contamination rate is increasing rapidly. Thus, 
      prevention and protection measures should be adopted in these cities aiming to 
      reduce transmission and the possible collapse of the health system.

      (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically 
      stable patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was an online survey conducted in 
      COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei 
      province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. 
      RESULTS: A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 
      43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a 
      family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, Pâ¯=â¯0.01), suffering from severe 
      COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, Pâ¯=â¯0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent 
      social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were 
      independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL 
      than those without. CONCLUSION: Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable 
      patients with COVID-19. Regular screening and appropriate treatment of depression 
      are urgently warranted for this population.

AB  - Responding to the ongoing novel coronavirus (agent of COVID-19) outbreak, China 
      implemented "the largest quarantine in human history" in Wuhan on 23 January 2020. 
      Similar quarantine measures were imposed on other Chinese cities within days. Human 
      mobility and relevant production and consumption activities have since decreased 
      significantly. As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded 
      significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and 
      Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 
      for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel 
      restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we 
      reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly 
      associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic-on average, the air quality 
      index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO(2), PM(2.5), 
      PM(10), NO(2), and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, 
      respectively. (2) Mechanism analysis illustrated that the lockdowns of 44 cities 
      reduced human movements by 69.85%, and a reduction in the AQI, PM(2.5), and CO was 
      partially mediated by human mobility, and SO(2), PM(10), and NO(2) were completely 
      mediated. (3) Our findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of 
      green production and consumption.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
      caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 has caused tremendous suffering 
      and huge economic losses. We hypothesized that extreme measures of partial-to-total 
      shutdown might have influenced the quality of the global environment because of 
      decreased emissions of atmospheric pollutants. We tested this hypothesis using 
      satellite imagery, climatic datasets (temperature, and absolute humidity), and 
      COVID-19 cases available in the public domain. While the majority of the cases were 
      recorded from Western countries, where mortality rates were strongly positively 
      correlated with age, the number of cases in tropical regions was relatively lower 
      than European and North American regions, possibly attributed to faster 
      human-to-human transmission. There was a substantial reduction in the level of 
      nitrogen dioxide (NO(2): 0.00002Â molÂ m(-2)), a low reduction in CO 
      (<0.03Â molÂ m(-2)), and a low-to-moderate reduction in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD: 
      ~0.1-0.2) in the major hotspots of COVID-19 outbreak during February-March 2020, 
      which may be attributed to the mass lockdowns. Our study projects an increasing 
      coverage of high COVID-19 hazard at absolute humidity levels ranging from 4 to 
      9Â gÂ m(-3) across a large part of the globe during April-July 2020 due to a high 
      prospective meteorological suitability for COVID-19 spread. Our findings suggest 
      that there is ample scope for restoring the global environment from the ill-effects 
      of anthropogenic activities through temporary shutdown measures.

AB  - Immunocompromised patients may be at increased risk to develop COVID-19 during the 
      2019 Î²-coronavirus infection. We present the unique opportunity we had to monitor 
      the liver, IL-6 and immune cell course before, during and after COVID-19 in a boy 
      with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and type 1 diabetes (T1D). CD4 and CD8 T cells 
      frequencies decreased because of prednisolone, followed by a plateauing increase 
      whereas CD19CD20 B cell increased strongly and was unaffected by COVID-19 infection. 
      Moreover, the percentage of activated CD8 T cells expressing HLA-DR (CD8HLA-DR) 
      increased during COVID-19 and subsided after its clearance. Total regulatory T cells 
      (Tregs: CD4CD25CD127FOXP3) remained stable. Although activated Tregs 
      (CD4CD45RAFOXP3) strongly increased upon prednisolone, it decreased afterwards. 
      Furthermore, regulatory B cells (Bregs: CD19CD20CD24CD38) declined sharply owing to 
      prednisolone. Serum IL-6 remained undetectable at all times. We demonstrated for the 
      first time immune monitoring in a child with AIH and T1D before, during and after 
      COVID-19. We hypothesize that continuing with low level of prednisolone without 
      azathioprine may have abrogated activated Tregs, Bregs and IL-6 production and 
      therefore permitting the activation of CD8 T cells, clearing the virus.

PG  - 837-842
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1756700 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and 
      more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 
      remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region 
      suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that 
      promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured 
      SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) 
      or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original 
      clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 
      positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters 
      shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids 
      (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in 
      the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the 
      unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong 
      selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the 
      loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of 
      these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants 
      as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.

AB  - Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic for treatment resistant schizophrenia 
      but adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. The current COVID-19 
      pandemic may raise specific concerns for clinicians prescribing clozapine for 
      patients who need it. We report on two actively psychotic patients with treatment 
      resistant schizophrenia who required admission to our inner-London acute psychiatric 
      unit during the COVID-19 pandemic and who were treated with clozapine. One was a 
      young patient who developed COVID-19 symptoms and tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 
      virus while receiving clozapine and the other was an aging man who tested negative 
      for the SARS-CoV-2 virus but had contact with COVID-19 during initiation of 
      clozapine treatment. Both responded to clozapine treatment and were safely 
      discharged from hospital without any complication. These cases suggest that, in the 
      absence of complications, exposure to COVID-19 per se and the onset of mild symptoms 
      in those infected may not warrant withdrawal or postponement of clozapine treatment 
      when this is indicated.

AB  - Coronavirus pneumonia is accompanied by rapid virus replication, where a large 
      number of inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine storm may lead to acute lung 
      injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. The uncontrolled 
      release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6, is 
      associated with ARDS. This constituted the first study to report on the variability 
      in physicochemical properties of Î²-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom 
      Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative 
      stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective 
      properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial 
      (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models 
      of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of Î±-glucans 
      and correspondingly less Î²-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying 
      immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-ÎºB 
      activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving 
      more effective at lower doses. In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, 
      the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production 
      (TNF-Î±, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-Î² and IL-10. The CL extract 
      attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract 
      attenuated late apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate significant physicochemical 
      differences between Lentinan extracts, which produce differential in vitro 
      immunomodulatory and pulmonary cytoprotective effects that may also have positive 
      relevance to candidate COVID-19 therapeutics targeting cytokine storm.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the attack rates, and identify the risk factors of 
      COVID-19 infection. Based on a retrospective cohort study, we investigated 11,580 
      contacts of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong Province from 10 January to 15 March 2020. 
      All contacts were tested by RT-PCR to detect their infection of SARS-COV-2. Attack 
      rates by characteristics were calculated. Logistic regression was used to estimate 
      the risk factors of infection for COVID-19. A total of 515 of 11,580 contacts were 
      identified to be infected with SARS-COV-2. Compared to young adults aged 20-29 
      years, the infected risk was higher in children (RR: 2.59, 95%CI: 1.79-3.76), and 
      old people aged 60-69 years (RR: 5.29, 95%CI: 3.76-7.46). Females also had higher 
      infected risk (RR: 1.66, 95%CI: 1.39-2.00). People having close relationship with 
      index cases encountered higher infected risk (RR for spouse: 20.68, 95%CI: 
      14.28-29.95; RR for non-spouse family members: 9.55, 95%CI: 6.73-13.55; RR for close 
      relatives: 5.90, 95%CI: 4.06-8.59). Moreover, contacts exposed to index case in 
      symptomatic period (RR: 2.15, 95%CI: 1.67-2.79), with critically severe symptoms 
      (RR: 1.61, 95%CI: 1.00-2.57), with symptoms of dizzy (RR: 1.58, 95%CI: 1.08-2.30), 
      myalgia (RR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.15-1.94), and chill (RR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.05-1.92) had 
      higher infected risks. Children, old people, females, and family members are 
      susceptible of COVID-19 infection, while index cases in the incubation period had 
      lower contagiousness. Our findings will be helpful for developing targeted 
      prevention and control strategies to combat the worldwide pandemic.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: U.S. commercial drivers are entrenched in a stressogenic profession, 
      and exposures to endemic chronic stressors shape drivers' behavioral and 
      psychosocial responses and induce profound health and safety disparities. To gain a 
      complete understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic will affect commercial driver 
      stress, health, and safety over time, and to mitigate these impacts, research and 
      prevention efforts must be grounded in theoretical perspectives that contextualize 
      these impacts within the chronic stressors already endemic to profession, the 
      historical and ongoing forces that have induced them, and the potentially 
      reinforcing nature of the resulting afflictions. METHODS: Extant literature reveals 
      how an array of macro-level changes has shaped downstream trucking industry 
      policies, resulting in stressogenic work organization and workplace characteristics. 
      Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates existing stressors 
      and introduces novel stressors, with potentially exacerbatory impacts on health and 
      safety disparities. RESULTS: As COVID-19 exerts an array of multi-level stressors on 
      commercial drivers, syndemic frameworks can provide the appropriate theoretical lens 
      to guide research and prevention. Syndemic frameworks can provide the grounding to 
      allow foregoing commercial driver COVID-19 research to transcend the limitations of 
      prevailing research frameworks by contextualizing COVID-19 stressors holistically 
      within the complex system of endemic chronic stressors and interrelated health and 
      safety afflictions. Syndemic-informed prevention efforts can then be implemented 
      that simultaneously tackle multiple afflictions and the macro-level forces that 
      result in the emergence of commercial drivers' health and safety disparities over 
      time. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial drivers cannot 
      be adequately understood or acted upon in isolation from the endemic chronic 
      stressors and interrelated health and safety disparities that characterize the 
      profession. Instead, commercial driver COVID-19 research and prevention needs 
      syndemic frameworks to holistically understand the impacts of COVID-19 on commercial 
      driver stress, health, and safety, and to identify high-leverage preventive actions.

AB  - The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV first appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. 
      While most of the initial cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, 
      person-to-person transmission has been verified. Given that a vaccine cannot be 
      developed and deployed for at least a year, preventing further transmission relies 
      upon standard principles of containment, two of which are the isolation of known 
      cases and the quarantine of persons believed at high risk of exposure. This note 
      presents probability models for assessing the effectiveness of case isolation and 
      quarantine within a community during the initial phase of an outbreak with 
      illustrations based on early observations from Wuhan.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÂ 2 (SARSâCoVâ2) is a novel 
      Î²Â coronavirus that is the etiological agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVIDâ19) that at the time of writing (JuneÂ 16, 2020) has infected almost 6Â million 
      people with some 450,000Â deaths. These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 
      80%) cases of COVIDâ19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases 
      (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need 
      recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVIDâ19 infection appears to occur 
      globally between 0.1Â andÂ 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of 
      lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other 
      comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes 
      of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) 
      represent the primary causes of lethality during COVIDâ19 infection. Increasing 
      evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the 
      coagulation system including marked elevation of Dâdimer that correlate negatively 
      with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the 
      development of DIC provoked by SARSâCoVâ2 infection may represent a secondary 
      antiâphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism 
      and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for 
      coagulopathy during the course of COVIDâ19 infection. Diagnostic and therapeutic 
      implications of this are also discussed.

AB  - This study aims to present the correlation between sunlight exposure and Covid-19 
      statuses in Jakarta, Indonesia. The secondary data analysis was derived from 
      surveillance data for Covid-19 from government authorities, including the Ministry 
      of Health, the Meteorological, Climatological, and Geophysical Agency, and the local 
      government of Jakarta. Three statuses related to Covid-19 were examined in the 
      study: incidence, death, and recovered. Meanwhile, sunlight exposure was presented 
      as daily duration of it. Only the number of recovered patients correlated 
      significantly with sunlight exposure (p-valueÂ =Â .025; rÂ =Â 0.350). This study's 
      findings showed that sunlight exposure was associated with recovery from Covid-19.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced a world-wide collapse 
      of social and economic infrastructure, as well as constrained our freedom of 
      movement. This respiratory tract infection is nefarious in how it targets the most 
      distal and highly vulnerable aspect of the human bronchopulmonary tree, 
      specifically, the delicate yet irreplaceable alveoli that are responsible for the 
      loading of oxygen upon red cell hemoglobin for use by all of the body's tissues. In 
      most symptomatic individuals, the disease is a mild immune-mediated syndrome, with 
      limited damage to the lung tissues. About 20% of those affected experience a disease 
      course characterized by a cataclysmic set of immune activation responses that can 
      culminate in the diffuse and irreversible obliteration of the distal alveoli, 
      leading to a virtual collapse of the gas-exchange apparatus. Here, in Part I of a 
      duology on the characterization and potential treatment for COVID-19, we define 
      severe COVID-19 as a consequence of the ability of the severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to trigger what we now designate for the first 
      time as a 'Prolific Activation of a Network-Immune-Inflammatory Crisis', or 'PANIC' 
      Attack, in the alveolar tree. In Part II we describe an immunotherapeutic hypothesis 
      worthy of the organization of a randomized clinical trial in order to ascertain 
      whether a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent is capable of 
      abolishing 'PANIC'; thereby preventing or mitigating severe COVID-19, with 
      monumental ramifications for world health, and the global pandemic that continues to 
      threaten it.

AB  - Recently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide public 
      health threat. Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of 
      COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted 
      infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with 
      confirmed cases during January 21-February 27 were collected and considered as the 
      specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the 
      spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche 
      models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for 
      identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three 
      megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected 
      communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well 
      as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been 
      preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various 
      influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 
      100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method 
      was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the 
      potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local 
      hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for 
      sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more 
      residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for 
      relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe 
      epidemics in similar megacities in the world.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The present research aimed to determine the relation between the use 
      of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inh) and angiotensinogen receptor 
      blockers (ARBs) and in-hospital mortality of hypertensive patients diagnosed with 
      Covid-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In this retrospective study, we included 
      113 consecutive hypertensive patients admitted due to Covid-19 infection. In all 
      patients, Covid-19 infection was confirmed with using reverse-transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction. All patients were on ACE inh/ARBs or other 
      antihypertensive therapy unless no contraindication was present. The primary outcome 
      of the study was the in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: In total, 113 
      hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using ACE 
      inh/ARBs. During in-hospital follow up, 30.9% [nÂ =Â 35 patients] of patients died. 
      The frequency of admission to the ICU and endotracheal intubation were significantly 
      higher in patients using ACE inh/ARBs. In a multivariable analysis, the use of ACE 
      inh/ARBs was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 
      1.11-18.18; p=Â .032). Kaplan-Meir curve analysis displayed that patients on ACE 
      inh/ARBs therapy had higher incidence of in-hospital death than those who were not. 
      CONCLUSION: The present study has found that the use of ACE inh/ARBs therapy might 
      be associated with an increased in-hospital mortality in patients who were diagnosed 
      with Covid-19 pneumonia. It is likely that ACE inh/ARBs therapy might not be 
      beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that 
      there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the 
      results of the study.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in the city 
      of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in late 2019. Since then, the virus has spread 
      globally and caused a pandemic. Assays that can measure the antiviral activity of 
      antibodies or antiviral compounds are needed for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and drug 
      development. Here, we describe in detail a microneutralization assay, which can be 
      used to assess in a quantitative manner if antibodies or drugs can block entry 
      and/or replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Â© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health 
      service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the 
      mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three methods were used to 
      assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre 
      traffic were compared across two time periods: the "comparison period" (1 to 28 
      September 2019), and during the early weeks of the "COVID-19 pandemic" (19 March to 
      15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all 
      patients who started an assessment during the comparison (nÂ =Â 1650) and the COVID-19 
      period (nÂ =Â 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 
      introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating 
      therapists were examined. RESULTS: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 
      90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared 
      to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 
      sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% 
      vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety 
      symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety 
      and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of 
      symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the 
      impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had 
      higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were 
      concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the 
      effect of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant 
      increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases 
      in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of 
      movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing 
      clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.

AB  - In spite of the relatively high morbidity and mortality, there is no approved 
      medication yet for COVID-19. There are more than 200 ongoing trials on different 
      drugs or vaccines, but new medications may take until 2021 to develop. Defining the 
      optimal number of patients to be included in a study is a considerable challenge in 
      these interventional researches. Ethical considerations prompt researchers to 
      minimize the number of patients included in a trial. This gains particular 
      importance when the disease is rare or lethal which is particularly so in the case 
      of COVID-19. It is of paramount importance to explore some of the available tools 
      that could help accelerate the adoption of any or some of the many proposed 
      modalities for the treatment of diseases. These tools should be effective, yet 
      efficient, for rapid testing of such treatments. Sequential analysis has not been 
      frequently used in many clinical trials where it should have been used. None of the 
      authors in published literature, as far as we know, used sequential analysis 
      techniques to test potential drugs for COVID-19. In addition to its usefulness when 
      the results of new forms of treatment are quickly needed, other important benefit of 
      sequential analysis includes the ability to reach a similar conclusion about the 
      utility of a new drug without unduly exposing more patients to the side effect of 
      the old drug, in particularly, for the treatment of a rare disease.

AB  - It is likely that genetic factors play a role in the susceptibility to, and recovery 
      from, COVID-19. A survey of ongoing twin research could produce findings likely to 
      help in the prevention and management of this pandemic. This survey is followed by a 
      review of research comparing selected features of asthmatic and nonasthmatic twins, 
      links between twin mammals and COVID-19, and relationships between twin delivery and 
      the three 'Rs'. The final section of this article presents newsworthy twin-related 
      items, some associated with COVID-19. They include a summary of the Rainman Twins 
      film, a study of anal prints, the 'Twins' Irish pub, newborn twins 'Covid and 
      Corona', the death of a surgeon who separated conjoined twins, and Twinco, a 
      twin-based supply company.

AB  - After the initial outbreak in China, the diffusion in Italy of SARS-CoV-2 is 
      exhibiting a clear regional trend with more elevated frequency and severity of cases 
      in Northern areas. Among multiple factors possibly involved in such geographical 
      differences, a role has been hypothesized for atmospheric pollution. We provide 
      additional evidence on the possible influence of air quality, particularly in terms 
      of chronicity of exposure on the spread viral infection in Italian regions. Actual 
      data on Covid-19 outbreak in Italian provinces and corresponding long-term air 
      quality evaluations, were obtained from Italian and European agencies, elaborated 
      and tested for possible interactions. Our elaborations reveal that, beside 
      concentrations, the chronicity of exposure may influence the anomalous variability 
      of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Data on distribution of atmospheric pollutants (NO(2), O(3), 
      PM(2.5) and PM(10)) in Italian regions during the last 4 years, days exceeding 
      regulatory limits, and years of the last decade (2010-2019) in which the limits have 
      been exceeded for at least 35 days, highlight that Northern Italy has been 
      constantly exposed to chronic air pollution. Long-term air-quality data 
      significantly correlated with cases of Covid-19 in up to 71 Italian provinces 
      (updated April 27, 2020) providing further evidence that chronic exposure to 
      atmospheric contamination may represent a favourable context for the spread of the 
      virus. Pro-inflammatory responses and high incidence of respiratory and cardiac 
      affections are well known, while the capability of this coronavirus to bind 
      particulate matters remains to be established. Atmospheric and environmental 
      pollution should be considered as part of an integrated approach for sustainable 
      development, human health protection and prevention of epidemic spreads but in a 
      long-term and chronic perspective, since adoption of mitigation actions during a 
      viral outbreak could be of limited utility.

AB  - In early March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 as a 
      pandemic, and in late March 2020 partial lockdown was ordered by the SÃ£o Paulo state 
      government. The aim of this study was to assess impacts on air quality in SÃ£o Paulo 
      - Brazil, during the partial lockdown implemented to provide social distancing 
      required due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have analyzed data from four air quality 
      stations in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil to assess air pollutant concentration variations 
      during the partial lockdown. Data were compared to the five-year monthly mean and to 
      the four-week before the partial lockdown. Overall, drastic reductions on NO (up to 
      -77.3%), NO(2) (up to -54.3%), and CO (up to -64.8%) concentrations were observed in 
      the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. By 
      contrast, an increase of approximately 30% in ozone concentrations was observed in 
      urban areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic, probably related to nitrogen 
      monoxide decreases. Although the partial lockdown has contributed to a positive 
      impact on air quality, it is important to take into account the negative impacts on 
      social aspects, considering the deaths caused by COVID-19 and also the dramatic 
      economic effects.

AB  - The effect of lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on air 
      pollution in four Southern European cities (Nice, Rome, Valencia and Turin) and 
      Wuhan (China) was quantified, with a focus on ozone (O(3)). Compared to the same 
      period in 2017-2019, the daily O(3) mean concentrations increased at urban stations 
      by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during 
      the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O(3) concentrations is mainly explained by an 
      unprecedented reduction in NO(x) emissions leading to a lower O(3) titration by NO. 
      Strong reductions in NO(2) mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, 
      ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO 
      declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in 
      Europe. Reductions in PM(2.5) and PM(10) at urban stations were overall much smaller 
      both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM 
      reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and 
      commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the 
      activities at home in some of the cities. The NO(x) concentrations during the 
      lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in 
      all cities. The lockdown effect on O(3) production was ~10% higher than the weekend 
      effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the 
      same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference). This study 
      highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as 
      O(3) even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results 
      are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution.

AB  - Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay on anal 
      swabs was recently reported to be persistently positive even after throat testing 
      was negative during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection. However, data about the consistent performance of RT-PCR assay on throat 
      and anal swabs remain limited in paediatric patients. Here, we retrospectively 
      reviewed RT-PCR-testing results of 212 paediatric patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 
      infection at Wuhan Children's Hospital. The diagnostic potential of these two types 
      of specimens showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs. 
      52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test Pâ=â0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive 
      consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, Pâ<â0.0001) in paediatric patients. Furthermore, 
      viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant 
      difference (Pâ=â0.9511) and correlation (Pearson râ=â0.0434, Pâ=â0.8406), and 
      exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different 
      types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic 
      tolerance, respectively. These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and 
      anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      correlated with different immune state in paediatric patients.

AB  - COVID-19 is a severe pandemic which has caused a devastating amount of loss in lives 
      around the world, and yet we still don't know how to appropriately treat this 
      disease. We know very little about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which 
      induces the COVID-19. However, COVID-19 does share many similar symptoms with SARS 
      and influenza. Previous scientific discoveries learned from lab animal models and 
      clinical practices shed light on possible pathogenic mechanisms in COVID-19. In the 
      past decades, accumulated scientific findings confirmed the pathogenic role of free 
      radicals damage in respiratory virus infection. Astonishingly very few medical 
      professionals mention the crucial role of free radical damage in COVID-19. This 
      hypothesis aims to summarize the crucial pathogenic role of free radical damage in 
      respiratory virus induced pneumonia and suggest an antioxidative therapeutic 
      strategy for COVID-19.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) known as COVID-19 has 
      emerged as a major threat to human existence. COVID-19 seems to have undergone 
      adaptive evolution through an intermediate host, most likely bats. The flu leads to 
      severe pneumonia that causes respiratory and multi-organ failure. The absence of any 
      known treatment procedures, drugs, or vaccines has created panic around the World. 
      The need is to develop rapid testing kits, drugs and vaccines. However, these 
      proposals are time-consuming processes. At present social distancing along with 
      previously known traditional medicines can act as quick and short-term alternatives 
      for treating this viral flu.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the ongoing dynamics of COVID-19 in India after its 
      emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. We discuss the effect of nationwide 
      lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
      Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active 
      COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible 
      inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts 
      that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will 
      occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value 
      of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a 
      relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the 
      post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a 
      non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to 
      prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public 
      health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is 
      a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and 
      administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies.

AB  - Clinical and epidemiological evidence has been advanced for human-to-human 
      transmission of the novel coronavirus rampaging the world since late 2019. Outliers 
      in the human-to-human transmission are yet to be explored. In this study, we 
      examined the spatial density and leaned statistical credence to the global debate. 
      We constructed spatial variations of clusters that examined the nexus between 
      COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases. We rely on publicly available data 
      on confirmed cases and death across Africa to unravel the unobserved factors, that 
      could be responsible for the spread of COVID-19. We relied on the dynamic system 
      generalised method of moment estimation procedure and found a ~0.045 Covid19 deaths 
      as a result of confirmed cases in Africa. We accounted for cross-sectional 
      dependence and found a basis for the strict orthogonal relationship. Policy measures 
      were discussed.

TI  - Effect of lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic on air quality of the megacity Delhi, 
      India.

AB  - Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for 
      three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due 
      to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically 
      slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to 
      be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air 
      pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the 
      air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special 
      reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant 
      parameters (PM(10), PM(2.5), SO(2), NO(2), CO, O(3) and NH(3)) for 34 monitoring 
      stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) 
      to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The 
      results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. 
      Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM(10) and PM(2.5) have witnessed 
      maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the 
      last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM(10) and 
      PM(2.5) is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO(2) 
      (-52.68%) and CO (-30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% 
      to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing 
      lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in 
      Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the 
      study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed 
      the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source 
      control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment.

TI  - Providing nutritional care to cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: an 
      Italian perspective.
PG  - 3987-3989
LID - 10.1007/s00520-020-05557-z [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has drastically changed practices inside hospitals, which 
      include oncology routines. In oncology, malnutrition was and certainly still is a 
      frequent problem associated with an increase in treatment-related toxicity, a 
      reduced response to cancer treatment, an impaired quality of life, and a worse 
      overall prognosis. Even in this situation of healthcare crisis, nutritional support 
      in cancer care is an essential element. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there 
      is a concrete high risk to see a dramatic worsening of cancer patients' nutritional 
      status, who are left without adequate clinical and nutritional support. The 
      consequences are already reasonably foreseeable and will have a severe negative 
      impact after the emergency. Therefore, we believe that it is essential to try to 
      continue, as far as possible, the activity of clinical nutrition in oncology, by 
      revolutionizing the setting and the approach to patients. For this purpose, the 
      Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics Unit and the Medical Oncology Unit of our hospital, 
      one of the largest community hospital in Lombardy that has been involved in the 
      COVID-19 outbreak management since its inception, have reorganized the clinical 
      routine activity in strict collaboration since the very beginning of the emergency, 
      to better face up to the challenge, while preserving cancer patients' needs.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate whether cotton mask worn by 
      respiratory infection person could suppress respiratory droplet levels compared to 
      medical mask. We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected 
      cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed 
      triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. Four 
      1-hour repeated measurements (two measurements for bedroom the others for car) of 
      particles with a size range of 20-1000Â nm measured by number concentrations 
      (NC(0.02)(-)(1)), temperature and relatively humidity, and cough/sneeze counts per 
      hour were conducted for each volunteer. The paired t-tests were used for 
      within-group comparisons in a bedroom and in a car. The results showed that there 
      was no significant difference in NC(0.02)(-)(1) or cough/sneeze counts between 
      volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car. We concluded 
      that the cotton mask could be a potential substitute for medical mask for 
      respiratory infection person in microenvironment with air conditioning. Healthy 
      people may daily use cotton mask in the community since cotton mask is washable and 
      reusable.

TI  - Charged PVDF multilayer nanofiber filter in filtering simulated airborne novel 
      coronavirus (COVID-19) using ambient nano-aerosols.
PG  - 116887
LID - 10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116887 [doi]
AB  - The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), average size 100Â nm, can be aerosolized by cough, 
      sneeze, speech and breath of infected persons. The airborne carrier for the COVID-19 
      can be tiny droplets and particulates from infected person, fine suspended mists 
      (humidity) in air, or ambient aerosols in air. To-date, unfortunately there are no 
      test standards for nano-aerosols (â¤100 nm). A goal in our study is to develop air 
      filters (e.g. respirator, facemask, ventilator, medical breathing filter/system) 
      with 90% capture on 100-nm airborne COVID-19 with pressure drop of less than 30Â Pa 
      (3.1Â mm water). There are two challenges. First, this airborne bio-nanoaerosol 
      (combined virus and carrier) is amorphous unlike cubic NaCl crystals. Second, unlike 
      standard laboratory tests on NaCl and test oil (DOP) droplets, these polydispersed 
      aerosols all challenge the filter simultaneously and they are of different sizes and 
      can interact among themselves complicating the filtration process. For the first 
      time, we have studied these two effects using ambient aerosols (simulating the 
      bio-nanoaerosols of coronavirus plus carrier of different shapes and sizes) to 
      challenge electrostatically charged multilayer/multimodule nanofiber filters. This 
      problem is fundamentally complicated due to mechanical and electrostatic 
      interactions among aerosols of different sizes with induced charges of different 
      magnitudes. The test filters were arranged in 2, 4, and 6 multiple-modules stack-up 
      with each module having 0.765Â g/m(2) of charged PVDF nanofibers (mean diameter 
      525Â Â±Â 191Â nm). This configuration minimized electrical interference among 
      neighboring charged nanofibers and reduced flow resistance in the filter. For 
      ambient aerosol size>80Â nm (applicable to the smallest COVID-19), the electrostatic 
      effect contributes 100-180% more efficiency to the existing mechanical efficiency 
      (due to diffusion and interception) depending on the number of modules in the 
      filter. By stacking-up modules to increase fiber basis weight in the filter, a 
      6-layer charged nanofiber filter achieved 88%, 88% and 96% filtration efficiency 
      for, respectively, 55-nm, 100-nm and 300-nm ambient aerosol. This is very close to 
      attaining our set goal of 90%-efficiency on the 100-nm ambient aerosol. The pressure 
      drop for the 6-layer nanofiber filter was only 26Â Pa (2.65Â mm water column) which 
      was below our limit of 30Â Pa (3.1Â mm water). For the test multi-module filters, a 
      high 'quality factor' (efficiency-to-pressure-drop ratio) of about 0.1 to 
      0.13Â Pa(-1) can be consistently maintained, which was far better than conventional 
      filters. Using the same PVDF 6-layer charged nanofiber filter, laboratory tests 
      results using monodispersed NaCl aerosols of 50, 100, and 300Â nm yielded filtration 
      efficiency, respectively, 92%, 94% and 98% (qualified for 'N98 standard') with same 
      pressure drop of 26Â Pa. The 2-6% discrepancy in efficiency for the NaCl aerosols was 
      primarily attributed to the absence of interaction among aerosols of different sizes 
      using monodispersed NaCl aerosols in the laboratory. This discrepancy can be further 
      reduced with increasing number of modules in the filter and for larger 300-nm 
      aerosol. The 6-layer charged nanofiber filter was qualified as a 'N98 respirator' 
      (98% capture efficiency for 300-nm NaCl aerosols) but with pressure drop of only 
      2.65-mm water which was 1/10 below conventional N95 with 25-mm (exhaling) to 35-mm 
      (inhaling) water column! The 6-layer charged PVDF nanofiber filter provides good 
      personal protection against airborne COVID-19 virus and nano-aerosols from pollution 
      based on the N98 standard, yet it is at least 10X more breathable than a 
      conventional N95 respirator.

TI  - Assessing the risk of seizures with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy for 
      COVID-19 in persons with epilepsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this systematic review is to assess the published literature 
      for seizure risk with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine therapy in persons with and 
      without epilepsy. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for 
      treatment against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine is one 
      proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, the 
      package insert states that these medications may provoke seizures in patients with 
      epilepsy, and this has resulted in increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy 
      community. METHODS: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 
      27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine and seizure 
      or epilepsy, convulsions, or status epilepticus. Selected studies were reviewed, and 
      the adverse drug reaction was classified. RESULTS: Only eleven out of 31 studies 
      were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. For chloroquine, eligible studies 
      were- one prospective study(n = 109), two case series(n = 6), and six case reports. 
      The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient with a 
      seizure, who was after taking 1000 mg. For hydroxychloroquine, there was one 
      prospective observational study(n = 631) and one case report. The clinical trials 
      failed to find any significant relation between seizures and chloroquine or 
      hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSION: Although the package insert describes an increased 
      risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not 
      supported by class I evidence. Clinicians, therefore, need to understand that data 
      regarding this specific topic is limited to case series and case reports. There is 
      no substantial evidence to suggest that these medications can increase seizure risk.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a health crisis - it is a full-blown economic and 
      social crisis that is impacting the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. 
      This commentary examines the mutually dependent relationship between health security 
      and universal health coverage (UHC), and how the longstanding underinvestment in 
      both renders us all vulnerable. It also discusses the vulnerability of services for 
      sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) in times of crisis, which is 
      compounded when these services are not included and well integrated into national 
      UHC packages. It concludes with a call for stronger political leadership for UHC and 
      SRHR as the global community strives to "build back better" after COVID-19.

TI  - Virus strain from a mild COVID-19 patient in Hangzhou represents a new trend in 
      SARS-CoV-2 evolution potentially related to Furin cleavage site.
PG  - 1474-1488
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1781551 [doi]
AB  - The mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome during COVID-19 dissemination are 
      unclear. In 788 COVID-19 patients from Zhejiang province, we observed decreased rate 
      of severe/critical cases compared with patients in Wuhan. For mechanisms 
      exploration, we isolated one strain of SARS-CoV-2 (ZJ01) from a mild COVID-19 
      patient. Thirty-five specific gene mutations were identified. Phylogenetic and 
      relative synonymous codon usage analysis suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential 
      evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 global virus strains based on 
      the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247 while ZJ01 has T at both sites. The 
      prediction of the Furin cleavage site (FCS) and sequence alignment indicated that 
      the FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 mutations identified 
      near the FCS (F1-2) caused changes in the structure and electrostatic distribution 
      of the S surface protein, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. 
      Single-cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that the Furin 
      expression was especially higher in glands, liver, kidneys, and colon. The 
      evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical 
      symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 caused mild flu-like symptoms, further 
      showing its potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home 
      quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We 
      investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their 
      impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 
      residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 
      2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress 
      Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying 
      COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated 
      anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. 
      RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. 
      Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least 
      moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation 
      modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between 
      general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and 
      depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: 
      Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from 
      only one country. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model 
      of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global 
      anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally 
      clinically important in driving excessive internet use.

AB  - The first COVID-19 case in Brazil was confirmed on February 25, 2020. On March 16, 
      the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro 
      and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this 
      work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by 
      comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone 
      concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the 
      same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. 
      Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among 
      the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant 
      reductions (30.3-48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. 
      NO(2) also showed reductions while PM(10) levels were only reduced in the first 
      lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was 
      observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and 
      need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due 
      to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 
      2019, NO(2) and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower. Meteorological 
      interferences, mainly the transport of pollutants from the industrial areas might 
      have also impacted the results.

TI  - Antirheumatic Disease Therapies for the Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review 
      and Meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1002/art.41469 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antirheumatic disease therapies have been used to treat coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications. We conducted a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis to describe the current evidence. METHODS: A search of published and 
      preprint databases in all languages was performed. Included studies described one or 
      more relevant clinical outcomes in five or more people who were infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 and were treated with antirheumatic disease therapy between 01/01/2019 
      and 05/29/2020. Pairs of reviewers screened articles and extracted data and assessed 
      risk of bias. A meta-analysis of effect sizes using the random-effects models was 
      performed when possible. RESULTS: The search identified 3,935 articles, of which 45 
      were included (4 randomized controlled trials, 29 cohort studies, and 12 case 
      series). All studies evaluated hospitalized patients and 29 out of 45 had been 
      published in a peer-reviewed journal. In a meta-analysis of three cohort studies 
      with a low risk of bias, hydroxychloroquine use was not significantly associated 
      with mortality (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      0.83-2.42). In a meta-analysis of two cohort studies with some concerns/high risk of 
      bias, anakinra use was associated with lower mortality (pooled HR 0.2, 95% CI 
      0.1-0.4). Evidence was inconclusive with regard to other antirheumatic disease 
      therapies and the majority of other studies had a high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: In 
      this systematic review and meta-analysis, hydroxychloroquine use was not associated 
      with benefit or harm with regard to COVID-19 mortality. The evidence supporting the 
      effect of other antirheumatic disease therapies in COVID-19 is currently 
      inconclusive.

AB  - There is some evidence that Covid 19 pneumonia is associated with prothrombotic 
      status and increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep venous thrombosis 
      and pulmonary embolism). Over a two-week period we admitted in our Unit 25 patients 
      with Covid-19 pneumonia, of these pulmonary embolism was diagnosed using computed 
      tomography angiography in 7. We report on clinical and biochemical features of these 
      patients. They were all males, with a mean age of 70.3Â years (range 58-84); 
      traditional risk factors for venous thromboembolism were identified in the majority 
      of patients with pulmonary embolism, however not differently from those without 
      pulmonary embolism. Clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism patients was usually 
      characterized by persistence or worsening of respiratory symptoms, with increasing 
      oxygen requirement. D-dimer levels were several fold higher than the upper threshold 
      of normal; in patients in whom PE was recognized during hospital stay, a rapid and 
      relevant increase of D-dimer levels was observed. Computed tomographic findings 
      ranged from massive acute pulmonary embolism to a segmental or sub-segmental 
      pattern; furthermore, thrombosis of sub-segmental pulmonary arteries within lung 
      infiltrates were occasionally seen, suggesting local mechanisms. Six out of 7 
      patients were treated with unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin with 
      clinical benefit within few days; one patient needed systemic thrombolysis (death 
      from hemorrhagic complication).

AB  - Since the first report of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in late December 2019, 
      the pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      has now widely spread to more than 187 countries and regions. However, it is unclear 
      whether there has been cryptic transmission before these early officially confirmed 
      cases, we therefore retrospectively screened for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 1271 
      nasopharyngeal swab samples, as well as the prevalence of IgM, IgG, and total 
      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in 357 matched serum samples collected from 
      hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness between 1 December 2018 and 31 
      March 2020 in Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. The onset date of the earliest COVID-19 case 
      in this study was 25 January 2020. Before this time point, the presence of 
      SARS-CoV-2 was not observed, which limited the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 has 
      already spread among the population before the large-scale outbreak. Additionally, 
      among 6662 patients with influenza-like illness from 1 December 2017 to 31 March 
      2020, the overall number of patients positive for influenza and other respiratory 
      viruses during the COVID-19 period decreased significantly when compared with that 
      in the same period of the last two years, reflecting that public health 
      interventions can effectively control the spread of common respiratory viruses.

AB  - Presently, COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to researchers, scientists, health 
      professionals, and administrations around the globe from its detection to its 
      treatment. The whole world is witnessing a lockdown like situation because of 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Persistent efforts are being made by the researchers to obtain 
      the possible solutions to control this pandemic in their respective areas. One of 
      the most common and effective methods applied by the researchers is the use of 
      CT-Scans and X-rays to analyze the images of lungs for COVID-19. However, it 
      requires several radiology specialists and time to manually inspect each report 
      which is one of the challenging tasks in a pandemic. In this paper, we have proposed 
      a deep learning neural network-based method nCOVnet, an alternative fast screening 
      method that can be used for detecting the COVID-19 by analyzing the X-rays of 
      patients which will look for visual indicators found in the chest radiography 
      imaging of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global 
      pandemic in early 2020. The infection has been associated with a wide range of 
      clinical symptoms. In the severely affected patients, it has caused dysregulation of 
      immune responses including over-secretion of inflammatory cytokines and imbalances 
      in the proportion of naÃ¯ve helper T cells, memory helper T cells and regulatory T 
      cells. Identification of the underlying mechanism of such aberrant function of 
      immune system would help in the prediction of disease course and selection of 
      susceptible patients for more intensive cares. In the current review, we summarize 
      the results of studies which reported alterations in cytokine levels and immune cell 
      functions in patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses.

TI  - Risk of the Brazilian health care system over 5572 municipalities to exceed health 
      care capacity due to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

AB  - The spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has challenged governments to 
      develop public policies to reduce the load of the COVID-19 on health care systems, 
      which is commonly referred to as "flattening the curve". This study aims to address 
      this issue by proposing a spatial multicriteria approach to estimate the risk of the 
      Brazilian health care system, by municipality, to exceed the health care capacity 
      because of an influx of patients infected with the COVID-19. We estimated this risk 
      for 5572 municipalities in Brazil using a combination of a multicriteria 
      decision-making approach with spatial analysis to estimate the exceedance risk, and 
      then, we examined the risk variation by designing 5 control intervention scenarios 
      (3 scenarios representing reduction on social contacts, and 2 scenarios representing 
      investment on health care system). For the baseline scenario using an average 
      infection rate across Brazil, we estimated a mean Hospital Bed Capacity (HBC) value 
      of -16.73, indicating that, on average, the Brazilian municipalities will have a 
      deficit of approximately 17 beds. This deficit is projected to occur in 3338 
      municipalities with the north and northeast regions being at the greatest risk of 
      exceeding health care capacity due to the COVID-19. The intervention scenarios 
      indicate across all of Brazil that they could address the bed shortage, with an 
      average of available beds between 23 and 32. However, when we consider the shortages 
      at a municipal scale, bed exceedances still occur for at least 2119 municipalities 
      in the most effective intervention scenario. Our findings are essential to identify 
      priority areas, to compare populations, and to provide options for government 
      agencies to act. This study can be used to provide support for the creation of 
      effective health public policies for national, regional, and local intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is the second of a 2-part article that discusses essential case 
      management practices and strategies amidst the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in 
      support of managing during a crisis such as a global pandemic. Part II continues to 
      describe reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and their leaders 
      to meet the needs of patients/support systems during the crisis. It focuses on the 
      increased need for end-of-life care, impact on workers' compensation case management 
      practice, and the self-care needs of the professional case manager. PRIMARY PRACTICE 
      SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case management practice settings across the 
      continuum of health and human services, with special focus on acute care. 
      FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in a crisis case 
      managers and other health care professionals never faced something like it before. 
      At the same time, it has provided opportunities for innovation and creativity 
      including use of digital and telecommunication technology in new ways to ensure the 
      continued delivery of health and human services to those who need them regardless of 
      location. It has also resulted in the development of necessary and impactful 
      partnerships within and across different health care organizations and diverse 
      professional disciplines. Most importantly, this pandemic has required special 
      attention to the increased need of patients for timely palliative and end-of-life 
      care. In addition, it has prompted a focus on the safety, health, and well-being of 
      case managers and other health care professionals, resulting in expanded workers' 
      compensation case management practice coupled with the need for self-care and 
      resilience. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers 
      are integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles and 
      responsibilities are even more necessary during the uncertainty of a global pandemic 
      such as COVID-19. So far, the experience of this crisis has resulted in a deliberate 
      need to ensure the safety of both, those who are the recipients of health care 
      services and those who are responsible for the provision of care. Self-care and 
      resilience of health care professionals and case managers, especially due to the 
      complex dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic, have advanced a desirable and necessary 
      view of remote/virtual practice and as a strategy for enhancing the person's health 
      and well-being. This pandemic has forced the development of impactful partnerships 
      and collaborations among the diverse contexts of health care organizations and 
      support service providers. These contexts of care delivery have also emphasized the 
      necessary legal and ethical practice of case managers and the other involved 
      parties. Experts agree that the innovative care delivery methods practiced during 
      the pandemic will undoubtedly remain as desirable beyond the current crisis period.

AB  - Since its first appearance in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the new coronavirus 
      (COVID-19) has evolved a global pandemic within three months, with more than 4.3 
      million confirmed cases worldwide until mid-May 2020. As many countries around the 
      world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced 
      lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has 
      brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the 
      reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental 
      measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution 
      and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations 
      from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO(2) column density from 
      Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations 
      across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants 
      associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due 
      to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the 
      pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) 
      in tropospheric NO(2) was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass 
      burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM(10), PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), and CO 
      concentrations have been decreased by 26-31%, 23-32%, 63-64%, 9-20%, and 25-31%, 
      respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same 
      periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban 
      and rural sites across the country. Quantifying the reductions in major and health 
      harmful air pollutants is crucial for health-related research and for air-quality 
      and climate-change studies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of serological total 
      antibody tests combined with RT-PCR for detection of SARS-COV-2. We conducted a 
      retrospective study in which 375 patients were enrolled during the outbreak of 
      SARS-COV-2 from 25th January to 16th March 2020. Patients were divided into a 
      COVID-19 group (n = 141) and a control group (n = 234). Serum samples and throat 
      swabs were collected from 375 patients for total antibody testing against SARS-COV-2 
      and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. The results indicated that diagnostic sensitivity 
      and specificity were 95.7 % and 98.7 %, 92.2 % and 100 % by total antibody tests and 
      RT-PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of total antibody tests 
      combined with RT-PCR were 98.6 % and 98.7 %. The sensitivity of the combined method 
      was significantly higher than RT-PCR (X(2) = 5.16, P < 0.05), and similar to that of 
      total antibody tests (X(2) = 1.15, P> 0.05). This study supported the advantage of 
      the combined method for detection of SARS-COV-2 with a high degree of sensitivity 
      and specificity, as a useful tool for accurate diagnosis and timely treatment of 
      suspected patients, epidemiological investigation, as well as monitoring ongoing 
      outbreaks of infections with SARS-COV-2.

TI  - COVID-19: Development of a robust mathematical model and simulation package with 
      consideration for ageing population and time delay for control action and 
      resusceptibility.
PG  - 132599
LID - 10.1016/j.physd.2020.132599 [doi]
AB  - The current global health emergency triggered by the pandemic COVID-19 is one of the 
      greatest challenges we face in this generation. Computational simulations have 
      played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such 
      simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and 
      is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational 
      simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other 
      epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified 
      SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and 
      resusceptibility, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend 
      prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; 
      death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also 
      considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay 
      on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as 
      resusceptibility with temporal immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical 
      symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model aims to reflect better on the 
      current scenario and case data reported, such that the spread of the disease and the 
      efficiency of the control action taken can be better understood. The model is 
      verified using two case studies based on the real-world data in South Korea and 
      Northern Ireland.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, may be transmitted via 
      airborne droplets or contact with surfaces onto which droplets have deposited. In 
      this study, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to survive in the dark, at two different 
      relative humidity values and within artificial saliva, a clinically relevant matrix, 
      was investigated. SARS-CoV-2 was found to be stable, in the dark, in a dynamic small 
      particle aerosol under the four experimental conditions we tested and viable virus 
      could still be detected after 90 minutes. The decay rate and half-life was 
      determined and decay rates ranged from 0.4 to 2.27 % per minute and the half lives 
      ranged from 30 to 177 minutes for the different conditions. This information can be 
      used for advice and modelling and potential mitigation strategies.

TI  - Could herbal medicine (Soshihotang) be a new treatment option for COVID-19?: a 
      narrative review.
PG  - 100480
LID - 10.1016/j.imr.2020.100480 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the world struggles under the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      pandemic, a variety of antiviral agents and symptomatic treatments are being 
      administered to patients and urgent clinical trials are underway. Under these 
      circumstances, it is important to explore various possibilities for the treatment of 
      COVID-19 including herbal medicines. Among various herbal medicines, Soshihotang 
      (SSHT, Xiao Chai Hu Tang in Chinese) has been prescribed to treat various viral 
      diseases and is used in combination with other herbal medicines depending on the 
      patient's symptoms. METHODS: For conducting the present review, we searched 
      electronic databases focusing on the antiviral effect of SSHT in experimental and 
      clinical study until April 2020. The search keywords included SSHT, constituents of 
      SSHT, and antiviral effect. We also searched for materials related to topic directly 
      from websites and published books. Based on these search results, we summarized the 
      results of the included materials in the form of a narrative review. RESULTS: In a 
      number of recent clinical studies, treatment with SSHT improved the infection status 
      of the respiratory and hepatobiliary systems, and experimental studies demonstrated 
      the antiviral effect of SSHT and its components. Furthermore, SSHT are being used in 
      China-where COVID-19 outbreak first took place-and offer a new option to treat 
      COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Based on the present evidences, it is believed that SSHT is 
      likely to be a new therapeutic option for COVID-19. Conducting further studies might 
      provide improved understanding regarding the use of SSHT in treating COVID-19.

AB  - Media reports can modify people's knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, and 
      thus changing the public attitudes and behaviors. However, how the media reports 
      affect the development of COVID-19 epidemic is a key public health issue. Here the 
      Pearson correlation and cross-correlation analyses are conducted to find the 
      statistically significant correlations between the number of new hospital 
      notifications for COVID-19 and the number of daily news items for twelve major 
      websites in China from January 11th to February 6th 2020. To examine the implication 
      for transmission dynamics of these correlations, we proposed a novel model, which 
      embeds the function of individual behaviour change (media impact) into the intensity 
      of infection. The nonlinear least squares estimation is used to identify the 
      best-fit parameter values in the model from the observed data. To determine impact 
      of key parameters with media impact and control measures for the later outcome of 
      the outbreak, we also carried out the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These 
      findings confirm the importance of the responses of individuals to the media 
      reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public 
      under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating epidemic COVID-19, the media 
      publicity should be focused on how to guide people's behavioral changes by experts, 
      and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take 
      effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease.

AB  - Based on the rapid spread of the CoViD-2019, a lockdown was declared in the whole 
      Northern Italy by the Government. The application of increasingly rigorous 
      containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the 
      Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave 
      also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air 
      pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the 
      partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the 
      Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements 
      following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of 
      pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM(10), PM(2.5), BC, 
      benzene, CO, and NO(x)). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO(2) only in 
      the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the 
      significant decrease in NO(2) in the TL, the O(3) exhibited a significant increase, 
      probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more 
      accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan 
      than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O(3) in a more 
      significant way.

AB  - Nowadays, COVID-19 has put a significant responsibility on all of us around the 
      world from its detection to its remediation. The globe suffer from lockdown due to 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers are doing their best to discover the nature of 
      this pandemic and try to produce the possible plans to control it. One of the most 
      effective method to understand and control the evolution of this pandemic is to 
      model it via an efficient mathematical model. In this paper, we propose to model 
      COVID-19 pandemic by fractional order SIDARTHE model which did not appear in the 
      literature before. The existence of a stable solution of the fractional order 
      COVID-19 SIDARTHE model is proved and the fractional order necessary conditions of 
      four proposed control strategies are produced. The sensitivity of the fractional 
      order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model to the fractional order and the infection rate 
      parameters are displayed. All studies are numerically simulated using MATLAB 
      software via fractional order differential equation solver.

TI  - Ventilation/perfusion SPECT/CT findings in different lung lesions associated with 
      COVID-19: a case series.
PG  - 2453-2460
LID - 10.1007/s00259-020-04920-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this series of cases is to show the aspects of 
      ventilation/perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography combined with 
      computed tomography (V/Q SPECT/CT) in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, 
      with the worsening of respiratory symptoms raising the suspicion of a pulmonary 
      embolism. Patients did not benefit from CT angiography for various reasons: a 
      contraindication, unavailability of the CT angiography, or a low clinical 
      probability for pulmonary embolism. METHODS: We retrospectively describe the results 
      of the V/Q SPECT/CT of five patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in the 
      nuclear medicine departments of the Centre Cardiologique du Nord and of the 
      Delafontaine hospital in Saint-Denis (Ile-de-France, France) between April 2, 2020, 
      and April 10, 2020. These patients had persistent dyspnea or chest pain suggesting 
      pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: The V/Q SPECT/CT allowed to diagnose a pulmonary 
      embolism in one of these five patients. We also noted several characteristics of the 
      perfusion and ventilation depending on the lung lesions on the CT scan. The areas 
      affected by COVID-19 were most often responsible for ventilatory anomalies with a 
      relatively preserved perfusion. In more advanced cases of pneumonia, with alveolar 
      fillings, the perfusion was also reduced or absent in accordance with large 
      ventilation defects. In addition, the healthy parenchyma appeared to benefit from an 
      uptake in ventilation and perfusion. CONCLUSION: V/Q SPECT/CT can play a role in the 
      management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for the diagnosis of embolic 
      complications with meticulous hygienic precautions. The different characteristics of 
      the ventilatory and perfusion anomalies related to COVID-19 pneumonia will be 
      confirmed with the next cases. In addition, in this pandemic context and facing a 
      significant infectious risk, the utility of ventilation will also have to be 
      specified.

TI  - Social determinants of health: the role of effective communication in the COVID-19 
      pandemic in developing countries.
PG  - 1788263
LID - 10.1080/16549716.2020.1788263 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many countries with 
      increasing morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, many of the actions and policies 
      adopted in countries are linked to the social determinants of health (SDH). The SDH 
      are critical determinants of health and health inequalities that are not directly 
      within the health sector. Policies such as social distancing, good hygiene, avoiding 
      large gatherings, cancelling of social and sports events, using personal protective 
      equipment, schools and restaurants closure, country lockdown, etc. are not 
      necessarily within the health sector but have been promoted to prevent and attenuate 
      COVID-19 infection rates significantly. The SDH that serve to reduce morbidity will 
      forestall or substantially reduce the pressure on many weak health systems in 
      developing countries that cannot cope with increased hospitalisation and intensive 
      health care. This paper argues that one of the most critical social determinants of 
      health (i.e. effective crisis and risk communication), is crucial in many developing 
      countries, including those with fewer confirmed coronavirus cases. We note that the 
      effectiveness of many of the other SDH in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 
      pandemic hinges on effective communication, especially crisis and risk 
      communication. Although many countries are adopting different communication 
      strategies during the COVID-19 crisis, effective crisis and risk communication will 
      lead to building trust, credibility, honesty, transparency, and accountability. The 
      peculiarity of many developing countries in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic 
      and ethnic diversity is an essential consideration in ensuring effective crisis and 
      risk communication. Developing countries facing significant poverty and disease 
      burden cannot afford to handle the burgeoning of COVID-19 infections and must take 
      preventive measures seriously. Thus, we submit that there is a need to intensify SDH 
      actions and ensure that no one is left behind when communicating crisis and risk to 
      the population to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

LID - 10.1097/BOR.0000000000000725 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is of special 
      concern for patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) and those who 
      care for them because of the potential for worse outcomes. This article analyzes 
      peer-reviewed research on the epidemiology and outcomes of COVID-19 in those with 
      IMID. RECENT FINDINGS: Published literature on approximately 1400 patients was 
      included from rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology. Data suggest that 
      those who are older and have comorbidities have poorer outcomes. This is consistent 
      with the reports from the general population of patients with COVID-19. Adjusted 
      analyses from the largest published studies demonstrate independent effects of 
      systemic glucocorticoids, as well as age and comorbidities with poorer COVID-19 
      outcomes (SECURE-IBD registry, nâ=â525; COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance 
      registry, nâ=â600); biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
      drug therapy has not been associated with more severe outcomes. These early results 
      will require validation in population-based studies as more data becomes available. 
      SUMMARY: Current data suggest that similar to the general population, age, and 
      comorbidities are risk factors for poorer COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IMID. 
      Additional research is needed to quantify outcomes and risk across rheumatic disease 
      types, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drugs.

LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109993 [doi]
AB  - Among the many efforts done by the scientific community to help coping with the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most important has been the creation of models to 
      describe its propagation, as these are expected to guide the deployment of 
      containment and health policies. These models are commonly based on exogenous 
      information, as e.g. mobility data, whose limitedness always compromise the 
      reliability of obtained results. In this contribution we propose a different 
      approach, based on extracting relationships between the evolution of the disease in 
      different regions through information theoretical metrics. In a way similar to what 
      is commonly done in neuroscience, propagation is understood as information transfer, 
      and the resulting propagation patterns are represented and studied as functional 
      networks. By applying this methodology to the dynamics of COVID-19 in several 
      countries and regions thereof, we were able to reconstruct static and time-varying 
      propagation graphs. We further discuss the advantages, promises and open research 
      questions associated with this functional approach.

AB  - It is essential to know the environmental parameters within which the severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can survive to understand its global 
      dispersal pattern. We found that 60.0% of the confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) occurred in places where the air temperature ranged from 5Â Â°C to 
      15Â Â°C, with a peak in cases at 11.54Â Â°C. Moreover, approximately 73.8% of the 
      confirmed cases were concentrated in regions with absolute humidity of 3Â g/m(3) to 
      10Â g/m(3). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be spreading toward higher latitudes. Our findings 
      suggest that there is an optimal climatic zone in which the concentration of 
      SARS-CoV-2 markedly increases in the ambient environment (including the surfaces of 
      objects). These results strongly imply that the COVID-19 pandemic may spread 
      cyclically and outbreaks may recur in large cities in the mid-latitudes in autumn 
      2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a 
      pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals 
      during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs 
      unclear. METHOD: We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary 
      concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood 
      disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents 
      without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL 
      heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on 
      April 1(st) 2020. RESULTS: Psychological distress was heightened in the mood 
      disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and 
      depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those 
      with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of 
      depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were 
      particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to 
      those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to 
      lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and 
      linked to higher levels of distress. LIMITATIONS: Mood disorder was self-reported 
      and was not clinically verified. CONCLUSIONS: Current psychological distress levels 
      are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive 
      situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.

AB  - Concerns regarding the comorbidity as a significant risk factor for Coronavirus 
      Disease-2019 (COVID-19), gave rise to an urgent need for studies evaluating patients 
      with chronic conditions such as autoinflammatory diseases (AIDs). We prepared a 
      web-based survey investigating the clinical findings and contact histories among 
      pediatric patients with AIDs. Confirmed COVID-19 cases, patients with contact 
      history and those with symptoms which were highly suggestive of COVID-19 were called 
      via phone or recruited to a video or face to face appointment. Data of AIDs were 
      obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. Laboratory and screening 
      findings were confirmed by our national health registry website. There were 404 
      patients (217 female) eligible for the enrollment. During pandemic, 375 (93%) were 
      on colchicine treatment and 48 (11.8%) were receiving biologic treatment. 
      Twenty-four out of 404 patients were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 suspicion. 
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) was identified through 
      rhinopharyngeal swabs in seven patients, six of whom were only on colchicine 
      treatment. Only one patient with no finding of any severe respiratory complications 
      was hospitalized. All of seven patients recovered completely. Among patients on 
      biologic drugs, neither a symptom nor a positive polymerase chain reaction test for 
      COVID 19 was detected. In conclusion, pediatric patients with AIDs, those receiving 
      biologic treatment and/or colchicine, may not be at increased risk for neither being 
      infected nor the severe disease course.

TI  - A Pragmatic Approach to Inpatient Diabetes Management during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaa342 [doi]
LID - dgaa342
AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 has presented new challenges to hospital personnel 
      providing care for infected patients with diabetes who represent more than 20% of 
      critically ill patients in intensive care units. Appropriate glycemic management 
      contributes to a reduction in adverse clinical outcomes in acute illness but also 
      requires intensive patient interactions for bedside glucose monitoring, intravenous 
      and subcutaneous insulin administration, as well as rapid intervention for 
      hypoglycemia events. These tasks are required at a time when minimizing patient 
      interactions is recommended as a way of avoiding prolonged exposure to COVID-19 by 
      health care personnel who often practice in settings with limited supplies of 
      personal protective equipment. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance 
      for clinicians for reconciling recommended standards of care for infected 
      hospitalized patients with diabetes while also addressing the daily realities of an 
      overwhelmed health care system in many areas of the country. The use of modified 
      protocols for insulin administration, bedside glucose monitoring, and medications 
      such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine that may affect glycemic control are 
      discussed. Continuous glucose monitoring systems have been proposed as an option for 
      reducing time spent with patients, but there are important issues that need to be 
      addressed if these are used in hospitalized patients. On-site and remote glucose 
      management teams have potential to provide guidance in areas where there are 
      shortages of personnel who have expertise in inpatient glycemic management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the highest number of cases in the world as of April 13, 2020, New 
      York City (NYC) became the epicenter of the global coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) pandemic. The data regarding palliative team involvement in patients with 
      COVID-19, however, remains scarce. We aimed to investigate outcomes of palliative 
      team involvement for the patients with COVID-19 in NYC. METHODS: Consecutive 225 
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 requiring hospitalization in our urban academic 
      medical center in NYC were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with 
      a palliative care consult (palliative group: 14.2% [n = 32]) versus those with no 
      palliative care consult (no palliative group: 85.8% [n = 193]). RESULTS: The 
      palliative group was older and had more comorbidities. During the hospital course, 
      the palliative group had more intensive care unit stays, rapid response team 
      activations, and more use of vasopressors (P < .05). Patients with palliative care 
      had higher rates of invasive mechanical ventilation than those without (46.9% vs 
      10.4%, P < .001). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed in 12 patients (6.5% 
      vs 5.2%, P = .77) and death rate was 100% in both subsets. Notably, initial code 
      status was not different between the 2 groups, however, code status at discharge was 
      significantly different between them (P < .001). The rate of full code decreased by 
      70% in the palliative group and by 47.5% in the no palliative care group from 
      admission to the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients hospitalized 
      for COVID-19 benefit from palliative team consults by helping to clarify advanced 
      directives and minimize futile resuscitative efforts.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) chilblains is a well-reported cutaneous pattern of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Through this narrative 
      review, we provide an evidence-based overview of idiopathic and secondary 
      chilblains, distinguishing features of COVID-19 chilblains, and a systematic 
      clinical approach to history, examination, investigations, and treatment. In the 
      absence of cold or damp exposure, COVID-19 should be considered as a cause of acute 
      chilblains. The timing of onset of COVID-19 chilblains relative to active SARS-CoV-2 
      viremia remains unclear. Patients with suspected COVID-19 chilblains should thus 
      follow public health guidelines for COVID-19 testing and self-isolation.

TI  - COVID-19 outcomes in MS: Observational study of early experience from NYU Multiple 
      Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and related 
      disorders with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. METHODS: From March 16 
      to April 30, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS 
      Comprehensive Care Center were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected 
      COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by 
      review of in-patient hospital records. RESULTS: We identified 76 patients (55 with 
      relapsing MS, of which 9 had pediatric onset; 17 with progressive MS; and 4 with 
      related disorders). Thirty-seven underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. 
      Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) 
      including anti-CD20 therapies (n = 34, 44.7%) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 
      modulators (n = 10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, 
      but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding 
      with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 
      critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or 
      with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, 
      progressive disease, and a nonambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an 
      increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with 
      MS with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors 
      associated with critical illness were similar to the general at-risk patient 
      population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this 
      preliminary sample.

TI  - The need for fully bio-based facemasks to counter coronavirus outbreaks: A 
      perspective.
PG  - 139611

LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139611 [doi]
AB  - The onset of coronavirus pandemic has sparked a shortage of facemasks in almost all 
      nations. Without this personal protective equipment, healthcare providers, essential 
      workers, and the general public are exposed to the risk of infection. In light of 
      the aforementioned, it is critical to balance the supply and demand for masks. 
      COVID-19 will also ensure that masks are always considered as an essential commodity 
      in future pandemic preparedness. Moreover, billions of facemasks are produced from 
      petrochemicals derived raw materials, which are non-degradable upon disposal after 
      their single use, thus causing environmental pollution and damage. The sustainable 
      way forward is to utilise raw materials that are side-stream products of local 
      industries to develop facemasks having equal or better efficiency than the 
      conventional ones. In this regard, wheat gluten biopolymer, which is a by-product or 
      co-product of cereal industries, can be electrospun into nanofibre membranes and 
      subsequently carbonised at over 700Â Â°C to form a network structure, which can 
      simultaneously act as the filter media and reinforcement for gluten-based masks. In 
      parallel, the same gluten material can be processed into cohesive thin films using 
      plasticiser and hot press. Additionally, lanosol, a naturally-occurring substance, 
      imparts fire (V-0 rating in vertical burn test), and microbe resistance in gluten 
      plastics. Thus, thin films of flexible gluten with very low amounts of lanosol 
      (<10Â wt%) can be bonded together with the carbonised mat and shaped by thermoforming 
      to create the facemasks. The carbon mat acting as the filter can be attached to the 
      masks through adapters that can also be made from injection moulded gluten. The 
      creation of these masks could simultaneously be effective in reducing the 
      transmittance of infectious diseases and pave the way for environmentally benign 
      sustainable products.

TI  - IL-1 induces throboxane-A2 (TxA2) in COVID-19 causing inflammation and 
      micro-thrombi: inhibitory effect of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra).
LID - 10.23812/20-34-4EDIT-65 [doi]
AB  - IL-1 induces a significant number of metabolic and hematological changes. In 
      experimental animals, IL-1 treatments cause hypotension due to rapid reduction of 
      systemic blood pressure, reduced vascular resistance, increased heart rate and 
      leukocyte aggregations. IL-1 causes endothelial dysfunction, the triggering factor 
      of which may be of a different nature including pathogen infection. This 
      dysfunction, which includes macrophage intervention and increased protein 
      permeability, can be mediated by several factors including cytokines and arachidonic 
      acid products. These effects are caused by the induction of IL-1 in various 
      pathologies, including those caused by pathogenic viral infections, including 
      SARS-CoV-2 which provokes COVID-19. Activation of macrophages by coronavirus-19 
      leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases and other 
      proteolytic enzymes that can cause thrombi formation and severe respiratory 
      dysfunction. Patients with COVID-19, seriously ill and hospitalized in intensive 
      care, present systemic inflammation, intravascular coagulopathy with high risk of 
      thrombotic complications, and venous thromboembolism, effects mostly mediated by 
      IL-1. In these patients the lungs are the most critical target organ as it can 
      present an increase in the degradation products of fibrin, fibrinogen and D-dimer, 
      with organ lesions and respiratory failure. It is well known that IL-1 induces 
      itself and another very important pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF, which also 
      participates in hemodynamic states, including shock syndrome in COVID-19. Both IL-1 
      and TNF cause pulmonary edema, thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to hypotension 
      and resistance of systemic blood pressure, IL-1 causes leukopenia and 
      thrombocytopenia. The formation of thrombi is the main complication of the 
      circulatory system and functionality of the organ, and represents an important cause 
      of morbidity and mortality. IL-1 causes platelet vascular thrombogenicity also on 
      non-endothelial cells by stimulating the formation of thromboxane A2 which is 
      released into the inflamed environment. IL-1 is the most important immune molecule 
      in inducing fever, since it is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid which 
      increases from vascular endothelial organs of the hypothalamus. The pathogenesis of 
      thrombosis, vascular inflammation and angigenesis involves the mediation of the 
      activation of the prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor. In 1986, in an interesting 
      article (Conti P, Reale M, Fiore S, Cancelli A, Angeletti PU, Dinarello CA. In vitro 
      enhanced thromboxane B2 release by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages 
      after treatment with human recombinant interleukin 1. Prostaglandins. 1986 
      Jul;32(1):111-5), we reported for the first time that IL-1 induces thromboxane B2 
      (TxB2) releases in activated neutrophils and macrophages. An increase in thromboxane 
      can induce leukocyte aggregation and systemic inflammation, which would account for 
      the dramatic thrombi formation and organ dysfunction. Hence, IL-1 stimulates 
      endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion, and TxB2 production. All these events are 
      supported by the large increase in neutrophils that adhere to the lung and the 
      decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, ecosanoids such as TxA2 (detected as TxB2) have 
      a powerful action on vascular inflammation and platelet aggregation, mediating the 
      formation of thrombi. The thrombogenesis that occurs in COVID-19 includes platelet 
      and cell aggregation with clotting abnormalities, and anti-clotting inhibitor agents 
      are used in the prevention and therapy of thrombotic diseases. Prevention of or 
      induction of TxA2 avoids thrombi formation induced by IL-1. However, in some serious 
      vascular events where TxA2 increases significantly, it is difficult to inhibit, 
      therefore, it would be much better to prevent its induction and generation by 
      blocking its inductors including IL-1. The inhibition or lack of formation of IL-1 
      avoids all the above pathological events which can lead to death of the patient. The 
      treatment of innate immune cells producing IL-1 with IL-1 receptor antagonist 
      (IL-1Ra) can avoid hemodynamic changes, septic shock and organ inflammation by 
      carrying out a new therapeutic efficacy on COVID-19 induced by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 3 million people and caused more than 240,000 
      death globally. Among the COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of people with other 
      chronic diseases, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary heart disease 
      is much higher than others. More strikingly, the survival rate of diabetic patients 
      is also much lower than in non-diabetic patients. In addition to the general damage 
      of high glucose to cells and tissues, a recent discovery that high glucose activates 
      interferon regulatory factor 15 promotes influenza virus -induced cytokine storm. 
      This discovery may shed light on the high incidence of diabetes in COVID-19. Several 
      diabetes prevention strategies together with recent significant data-driven diabetes 
      prediction approaches, which may help COVID-19 treatments, have been proposed.

TI  - COVID-19 created chaos across the globe: Three novel quarantine epidemic models.
PG  - 109928
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109928 [doi]
AB  - The latest version of human coronavirus said to be COVID-19 came out as a sudden 
      pandemic disease within human population and in the absence of vaccination and 
      proper treatment till date, it daunting threats heavily to human lives, infecting 
      more than 12, 11, 214 people and death more than 67, 666 people in 208 countries 
      across the globe as on April 06, 2020, which is highly alarming. When no treatment 
      or vaccine is available till date and to avoid COVID-19 to be transmitted in the 
      community, social distancing is the only way to prevent the disease, which is well 
      taken into account in our novel epidemic models as a special compartment, that is, 
      home isolation. Based on the transmitting behavior of COVID-19 in the human 
      population, we develop three quarantine models of this pandemic taking into account 
      the compartments: susceptible population, immigrant population, home isolation 
      population, infectious population, hospital quarantine population, and recovered 
      population. Local and global asymptotic stability is proved for all the three 
      models. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to establish the analytical 
      results with suitable examples. Our research reveals that home isolation and 
      quarantine to hospitals are the two pivot force-control policies under the present 
      situation when no treatment is available for this pandemic.

AB  - In December 2019, Wuhan, China suffered a serious outbreak of a novel coronavirus 
      infectious disease (COVID) caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-related 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV 2). To quickly identify the pathogen, we designed and screened 
      primer sets, and established a sensitive and specific qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV 2; 
      the lower limit of detection (LOD) was 14.8 (95% CI: 9.8-21) copies per reaction. We 
      combined this qRT-PCR assay with an automatic integration system for nucleic acid 
      extraction and amplification, thereby establishing an automatic integrated gene 
      detection system (AIGS) for SARS-CoV 2. Cross reactive analysis performed in 20 
      other respiratory viruses and 37 nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed a 100% specificity 
      of the assay. Using two fold diluted SARS-CoV 2 culture, the LOD of AIGS was 
      confirmed to be 365 copies/ml (95% CI: 351-375), which was Comparable to that of 
      conventional q RT-PCR (740 copies/ml, 95% CI: 689-750). Clinical performances of 
      AIGS assay were assessed in 266 suspected COVID-19 clinical respiratory tract 
      samples tested in parallel with a commercial kit. The clinical sensitivity of the 
      AIGS test was 97.62% (95% CI: 0.9320-0.9951) based on the commercial kit test 
      result, and concordance analysis showed a high agreement in SARS-CoV-2 detection 
      between the two assays, Pearson R was 0.9623 (95% CI: 0.9523-0.9703). The results 
      indicated that this AIGS could be used for rapid detection of SARS-CoV 2. With the 
      advantage of simple operation and less time consuming, AIGS could be suitable for 
      SARS-CoV2 detection in primary medical institutions, thus would do a great help to 
      improve detection efficiency and control the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - The Coronavirus (2019-Cov-2) infection Covid-19 is highly contagious caused by 
      single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) with nucleocapsid and spreading widely all across 
      the world and responsible for more than 3.6 million morbidity and 0.25 million 
      mortality No specific treatment is available till date. The clinical symptoms are 
      mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ 
      failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 
      (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. 
      Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and 
      shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the 
      survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar 
      to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results 
      by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved 
      by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is 
      estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 
      15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body 
      defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis. If 
      we go into hypoxic hypercapnic state no hyper coagulation takes place. Hence 
      Bhramari by enhancing the expression of Nitric Oxide and increased Carbon dioxide by 
      extended exhalation and alkaline pH prevents coagulopathies and morbidity due to 
      Covid-19.

TI  - Flattening the curve of mental ill-health: the importance of primary prevention in 
      managing the mental health impacts of COVID-19.
PG  - 200185

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced 
      this century. The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and 
      economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, appear to be impacting on 
      people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is 
      likely that many countries will experience a 'wave' of COVID-19 related mental 
      disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as 
      social isolation; unemployment; housing and income stress; intimate partner 
      violence; work-related trauma; and grief and loss. The 'two-pronged' approach used 
      to deal with COVID-19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental 
      health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new-onset 
      cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response 
      to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is 
      particularly important to 'flatten the curve' and avoid a surge in incidence of 
      mental disorders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions 
      designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. 
      These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning 
      programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among 
      others.

TI  - The Smallpox Epidemics in America in the 1700s and the Role of the Surgeons: Lessons 
      to be Learned During the Global Outbreak of COVID-19.
PG  - 2837-2841
LID - 10.1007/s00268-020-05670-4 [doi]
AB  - Today's COVID-19 pandemic offers many similarities with previous pandemics hitting 
      our country. In particular, the smallpox epidemics during the 1700s threatened the 
      lives of multitudes and created panic and fear in the society, similar to the 
      situation caused by the coronavirus. Remedies that were instituted, especially 
      inoculations, were met with opposition and even violence when first introduced. The 
      newspapers were filled with headlines reflecting the disputes. There was a "six feet 
      rule" during the smallpox epidemics, although it had a different meaning than today. 
      Politicians and other leaders of the society were engaged in the war against the 
      infection. Boston became involved in the fight against the smallpox by Dr. Zabdiel 
      Boylston's and Rev. Cotton Mather's introduction of inoculations. When George 
      Washington realized the benefits of the procedure and ordered mass inoculations of 
      the Continental Army, it became an important factor in winning not only the fight 
      against smallpox but the Revolutionary War as well. Looking back at history, 
      realizing that we have survived previous outbreaks of devastating diseases, can 
      provide hope during the current pandemic.

TI  - Air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the Yangtze River Delta 
      Region: An insight into the impact of human activity pattern changes on air 
      pollution variation.
PG  - 139282

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has spreaded rapidly across the world. To control the rapid 
      dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise 
      social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air 
      pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To 
      investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD 
      Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to 
      investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results 
      show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial 
      operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, 
      leading to lowered SO(2), NO(x), PM(2.5) and VOCs emissions by approximately 16-26%, 
      29-47%, 27-46% and 37-57% during the Level I and Level II response periods 
      respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the 
      improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM(2.5), NO(2) and SO(2) decreased by 
      31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during 
      the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction 
      and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with 
      primary emissions reduction of 15%-61%, the daily average PM(2.5) concentrations 
      range between 15 and 79Â Î¼gÂ m(-3), which shows that background and residual 
      pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual 
      pollution of PM(2.5) comes from industry (32.2-61.1%), mobile (3.9-8.1%), dust 
      (2.6-7.7%), residential sources (2.1-28.5%) in YRD and 14.0-28.6% contribution from 
      long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the 
      extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air 
      pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with 
      trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be 
      further taken into account.

TI  - Clinical Research in Hepatology in the COVID-19 Pandemic and Post-Pandemic Era: 
      Challenges and the Need for Innovation.
LID - 10.1002/hep.31491 [doi]
AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has drastically altered all facets of clinical care and 
      research. Clinical research in hepatology has had a rich tradition in several 
      domains, including the discovery and therapeutic development for diseases such as 
      hepatitis B and C, and studying the natural history of many forms of chronic liver 
      disease. NIH, foundation and industry funding has provided important opportunities 
      to advance the academic careers of young investigators while they strived to make 
      contributions to the field. Instantaneously, however, all non-essential research 
      activities were halted when the pandemic started, forcing those involved in clinical 
      research to re-think their research strategy, including a shift to COVID-19 research 
      while endeavoring to maintain their pre-existing agenda. Strategies to maintain the 
      integrity of ongoing studies, including patient follow up, safety assessments and 
      continuation of investigation products, have included a shift to telemedicine, 
      remote safety laboratory monitoring, and shipping of investigational products to 
      study subjects. As a re-vamp of research is being planned, unique issues that face 
      the research community include maintenance of infrastructure, funding, completion of 
      studies in the pre-determined time frame and the need to re-program career path 
      timelines. Real world databases, biomarker and long term follow up studies, and 
      research involving special groups (children, the homeless and other marginalized 
      populations) are likely to face unique challenges. The implementation of 
      telemedicine has been dramatically accelerated and will serve as a backbone for the 
      future of clinical research. As we move forward, innovation in clinical trial design 
      will be essential for conducting optimized clinical research.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 can infect the placenta and is not associated with specific placental 
      histopathology: a series of 19 placentas from COVID-19-positive mothers.
LID - 10.1038/s41379-020-0639-4 [doi]
AB  - Congenital infection of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be exceptionally rare despite many 
      cases of COVID-19 during pregnancy. Robust proof of placental infection requires 
      demonstration of viral localization within placental tissue. Only two of the few 
      cases of possible vertical transmission have demonstrated placental infection. None 
      have shown placental expression of the ACE2 or TMPRSS2 protein, both required for 
      viral infection. We examined 19 COVID-19 exposed placentas for histopathologic 
      findings, and for expression of ACE2, and TMPRSS2 by immunohistochemistry. Direct 
      placental SARS-CoV-2 expression was studied by two methods-nucleocapsid protein 
      expression by immunohistochemistry, and RNA expression by in situ hybridization. 
      ACE2 membranous expression in the syncytiotrophoblastÂ (ST) of the chorionic villi is 
      predominantly in a polarized pattern with expression highest on the stromal side of 
      theÂ ST. In addition, cytotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblast express ACE2. No 
      ACE2 expression was detected in villous stroma, Hofbauer cells, or endothelial 
      cells. TMPRSS2 expression was only present weakly in the villous endothelium and 
      rarely in the ST. In 2 of 19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in the placenta 
      focally in the ST and cytotrophoblast. There was no characteristic histopathology 
      present in our cases including the two placental infections. We found that the 
      placenta is capable of being infected but that this event is rare. We propose one 
      explanation could be the polarized expression of ACE2 away from the maternal blood 
      and pronounced paucity of TMPRSS2 expression in trophoblast.

AB  - Here, in Part II of a duology on the characterization and potential treatment for 
      COVID-19, we characterize the application of an innovative treatment regimen for the 
      prevention of the transition from mild to severe COVID-19, as well as detail an 
      intensive immunotherapy intervention hypothesis. We propose as a putative randomized 
      controlled trial that high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin (HDMTX-LR) rescue can 
      abolish 'PANIC', thereby 'left-shifting' severe COVID-19 patients to the group 
      majority of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, who are designated as having mild, even 
      asymptomatic, disease. HDMTX-LR is endowed with broadly pleiotropic properties and 
      is a repurposed, generic, inexpensive, and widely available agent which can be 
      administered early in the course of severe COVID-19 thus rescuing the critical and 
      irreplaceable gas-exchange alveoli. Further, we describe a preventative treatment 
      intervention regimen for those designated as having mild to moderate COVID-19 
      disease, but who exhibit features which herald the transition to the severe variant 
      of this disease. Both of our proposed hypothesis-driven questions should be urgently 
      subjected to rigorous assessment in the context of randomized controlled trials, in 
      order to confirm or refute the contention that the approaches characterized herein, 
      are in fact capable of exerting mitigating, if not abolishing, effects upon 
      SARS-CoV-2 triggered 'PANIC Attack'. Confirmation of our immunotherapy hypothesis 
      would have far-reaching ramifications for the current pandemic, along with yielding 
      invaluable lessons which could be leveraged to more effectively prepare for the next 
      challenge to global health.

      production. For this study, changes in the air quality index (AQI) and the 
      concentrations of six air pollutants (PM(2.5), PM(10), CO, SO(2), NO(2), and O(3)) 
      were evaluated during the Covid-19 control period in northern China. Overall, the 
      air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation 
      and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the transportation sector was linked 
      to the NO(2) emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries 
      were the major cause for the reductions of PM(2.5) and CO. The reduction in SO(2) 
      concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in 
      emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O(3) actually increased, 
      possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO(2) and as 
      a result greater O(3) production. These results also highlight need to control 
      emissions from the residential sector.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This paper aims to examine the CT imaging 
      characteristics of COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated CT images obtained between 10 
      January 2019 and 16 February 2020 at Taihe Hospital. Scans were conducted 2-6 times 
      per patient and the re-testing interval was 2-7Â days. Ninety-five patients with 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were included in this study and we 
      retrospectively analysed their CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: Ninety-five 
      patients underwent 2-3 SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests and received a definitive 
      diagnosis of COVID-19. Fifty-three were male and 42 were female, and their mean age 
      was 42Â Â±Â 12Â years (range: 10Â months to 81Â years). Sixty-nine patients (72.6%) 
      experienced fever, fatigue, and dry cough, while 15 (15.8%) had poor appetite and 
      fatigue, and 11 (11.6%) had a dry cough and no fever. On CT imaging, early stage 
      patients (nÂ =Â 53, 55.8%) showed peripheral subpleural ground-glass opacities; these 
      were mainly local patches (22/53, 41.5%), while some lesions were accompanied by 
      interlobular septal thickening. Thirty-four (35.8%) patients were classified in the 
      'progression stage' based on CT imaging; these patients typically showed lesions in 
      multiple lung segments and lobes (21/34ï¼61.8%), and an uneven increase in 
      ground-glass opacity density accompanied by consolidation and grid-like or cord-like 
      shadows(30.5%). Two patients (2.1%) showed a severe presentation on CT. These showed 
      diffuse bilateral lung lesions, mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation with 
      cord-like interstitial thickening and air bronchograms, entire lung involvement with 
      a "white lung" presentation, and mild pleural effusion. Six patients in remission 
      (6.3%), visible lesion absorption, fibrotic lesions. Based on clinical signs, 71 
      (74.7%), 22 (23.2%), and 2 (2.1%) patients had mild or moderate, severe, and 
      critical disease, respectively. Within the follow-up period, 93 patients recovered 
      and were discharged, including the 53 early stage patients and 34 progression stage 
      patients. The length of hospitalisation was 7-28Â days (mean: 10Â Â±Â 3.5Â days). On 
      discharge, lesions were significantly reduced in area and had in many cases 
      completely disappeared, while slight pulmonary fibrosis was present in some 
      patients. One severe stage patient was still hospitalised at the end of the 
      follow-up period and the other severe stage patient died. The overall mortality rate 
      was 1.05%. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the CT imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is 
      important for early lesion detection, determining the nature of lesions, and 
      assessing disease severity.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of 31 hemodialysis patients with 2019 novel coronavirus: a 
      retrospective study.

AB  - AIM: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has become pandemic. It brings serious 
      threat to hemodialysis (HD) patients. Therefore, we carried out a study on the 
      clinical characteristics of HD patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      analyzed the data of 31âHD patients with COVID-19. The clinical features of patients 
      include epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging test, treatment and 
      prognosis. RESULTS: 61.3% were severe, and 38.7% were mild. 83.9% had a close 
      contact history with COVID-19 patients. The average age was 62.3Â years comprising of 
      58.1% men and 41.9% women. Ninety percent had chronic diseases except ESRD. Clinical 
      symptoms include cough (85%), fever (43%), and shortness of breath (48.4%), etc. 
      Complications included ARDS (25.8%), AHF (22.6%), and septic shock (16.1%), etc. 
      64.5% of patients had remission, and 35.5% of patients had no remission with 6.5% 
      deaths. Compared with the baseline before infection, HD patients with COVID-19 had 
      lower lymphocytes, albumin and glucose, and higher D-dimer, albumin, phosphorus, 
      lactate dehydrogenase, and CRP. There was no significant correlation between the 
      neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio and the severity of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Compared 
      with the reported general population, the HD patients are susceptible to COVID-19 
      infection, especially older men and those with other underlying diseases. Moreover, 
      HD patients have more severe infection and inflammation with less symptoms and worse 
      outcome. COVID-19 infection can cause dialysis patients lower immunity, stronger 
      inflammation, malnutrition, and internal environment disorder. 
      Neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio does not reflect the severity of the HD patients with 
      COVID-19.

      patients with severe COVID-19: a retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1111/joim.13162 [doi]
AB  - among patients with COVID-19 who require treatment in intensive care for acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality rates have been reported between 16 
      - 78% (1). In patients who are discharged alive, an increased risk of sequelae from 
      COVID-19 is anticipated (2). The hyperinflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is 
      pivotal in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and is accompanied by an upregulated 
      expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6) that correlates with disease severity (3). 
      Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor originally licensed for 
      the use in rheumatoid arthritis, is also approved for treatment of chimeric antigen 
      receptor T cell-related cytokine release syndromes and secondary hemophagocytic 
      syndromes that share important features with the hyperinflammatory phase in 
      COVID-19. Several small studies from China and Europe have reported promising 
      results of the treatment with tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19, preventing the 
      need for admission to an intensive care unit and improving clinical outcomes (4,5). 
      We aimed to evaluate the impact of treatment with tocilizumab compared to routine 
      care on important clinical outcomes in critically ill patients admitted to an 
      intensive care unit with ARDS due to COVID-19.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown and social distancing mandates have disrupted 
      the consumer habits of buying as well as shopping. Consumers are learning to 
      improvise and learn new habits. For example, consumers cannot go to the store, so 
      the store comes to home. While consumers go back to old habits, it is likely that 
      they will be modified by new regulations and procedures in the way consumers shop 
      and buy products and services. New habits will also emerge by technology advances, 
      changing demographics and innovative ways consumers have learned to cope with 
      blurring the work, leisure, and education boundaries.

      and the community. In our country, in a short time span, the demand for critical 
      care beds exceeded supply. A new sequestered hospital completely dedicated to 
      intensive care (IC) for isolated COVID-19 patients needed to be designed, 
      constructed, and deployed. Along with this new initiative, the new concept of 
      "Pandemic Radiology Unit" was implemented as a practical solution to the emerging 
      crisis, born out of a critical and urgent acute need. The present article describes 
      logistics, planning, and practical design issues for such a pandemic radiology and 
      critical care unit (e.g., space, infection control, safety of healthcare workers, 
      etc.) adopted in the IC Hospital Unit for the care and management of COVID-19 
      patients.

TI  - When the COVID-19 pandemic changed the follow-up landscape of chronic kidney 
      disease: a survey of real-world nephrology practice.
PG  - 733-739
LID - 10.1080/0886022X.2020.1798783 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) require specialized 
      management. However, the current situation of CKD management is unclear during the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to investigate the influence 
      of the COVID-19 on kidney patients' follow-ups. METHODS: In April 2020, we included 
      patients who underwent kidney biopsy from January 2017 to December 2019 in a 
      referral center of China, and then initiated a survey via telephone on different 
      aspects of follow-up during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected and analyzed 
      demographic data, diagnoses, follow-up conditions, and telemedicine experience. 
      RESULTS: We reached 1190 CKD patients with confirmed kidney biopsies, and included 
      1164 patients for analysis after excluding those on dialysis. None of our patients 
      have had COVID-19, although more than 50% of them were complicated with other 
      comorbidities, and over 40% were currently using immunosuppressive treatments. 
      Face-to-face clinic visits were interrupted in 836 (71.82%) participants. Medicine 
      adjustments and routine laboratory examinations were delayed or made irregular in 
      about 60% of patients. To continue their follow-ups, 255 (21.90%) patients utilized 
      telemedicine, and about 80% of them were satisfied with the experience. The 
      proportion of telemedicine users was significantly higher in patients with 
      immunosuppressive treatments than those without (31.88% vs. 17.12%, pâ<â0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The risk of COVID-19 was mitigated in patients with CKD and other 
      co-existing risk factors when proper protection was utilized. The routine medical 
      care was disrupted during the pandemic, and telemedicine could be a reasonable 
      alternative method.

TI  - Guidelines for Surgical Tracheostomy and Tracheostomy Tube Change During the 
      COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review Article.
PG  - 398-401
LID - 10.1007/s12070-020-01893-y [doi]
AB  - The novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) has unfolded into a pandemic and is 
      continuing to propagate at a frightening speed. The aim of this article is to share 
      our protocol for performing a safe surgical tracheostomy in this COVID-19 era. 
      Tracheostomy procedures have a high risk of aerosol generation. To standardize 
      institutional safety measures with tracheostomy, we advocate using a dedicated 
      tracheostomy protocol applicable to all patients including those suspected of having 
      COVID-19. We also did explore the current literature and recommendations for 
      tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and studied the previous data from severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the virus responsible for the 
      SARS outbreak of 2003. We have prepared a protocol for performing a safe surgical 
      tracheotomy in patients affected by COVID-19. Surgeons who might be involved in 
      performing the tracheostomies should become familiar with these guidelines.

      survey.
PG  - e13428
LID - 10.1111/tid.13428 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The risk of COVID-19 is expected to be higher among solid organ 
      transplant. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 
      and the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the personal hygiene and expectations 
      of in heart and lung transplant recipients. METHODS: A telephone survey of heart 
      (n=69) and lung (n=41) transplant patients and a group of controls (n=41) was 
      conducted concerning personal hygiene before and after the outbreak; the impact on 
      subjective expectations regarding graft outcome; symptoms possibly associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection; diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: 79% of the patients declared 
      they increased the use of face masks and hand washing. Behavior at home regarding 
      self-isolation did not change. About half the patients said they were afraid of the 
      virus. A higher percentage of LTX were convinced that SARS-CoV-2 could have a 
      negative impact on the outcome of their graft. 28% declared that they were afraid to 
      come to the hospital for routine examinations and asked to postpone. Nine LTX and 
      five HTX patients experienced symptoms that could have been associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, but none of them underwent a nasopharyngeal swab. Only one LTX 
      was diagnosed with the infection. CONCLUSIONS: In our study we observed a low 
      incidence of COVID-19 in heart and lung transplant patients (0.9%), similar to that 
      of the general population of our Region. Isolation measures were already observed 
      before the pandemic and were further strengthened in most cases. Particular 
      attention should also be paid to new psychological and physical complications 
      indirectly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - A new SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus has 
      caused a pandemic known as COVID-19. Among coronaviruses, the main protease (M(pro)) 
      is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the 
      processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific 
      cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and 
      therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the 
      SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The 
      present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for 
      SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from 
      plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 
      M(pro), SARS-CoV M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro) were studied using molecular docking. 
      Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding 
      affinity (-9.28Â kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24Â kcal/mol). The molecular 
      binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as 
      hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) shows identities 
      of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro) respectively at 
      the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) 
      between SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and SARS-CoV M(pro) was found to be 0.517Â Ã and 0.817Â Ã 
      between SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro). Bonducellpin D exhibited 
      broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV M(pro) and MERS-CoV M(pro) and 
      therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in 
      vitro and in vivo studies.

AB  - Chinese cities have been placed upon lockdown in early 2020 in an attempt to contain 
      the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), as increasingly huge demands are being placed upon 
      Chinese and international health professionals to address this pandemic. 
      Surprisingly, planning and design professionals are absent in the discourses about 
      existing and post-COVID-19 strategies and actions even though previous pandemics 
      historically revealed major impacts on the urban fabric from social and economic 
      perspectives. This paper is a call for action for international architectural and 
      urban organisations to include pandemics and similar in their disaster management 
      strategies. This need is very evident in their need to better design creative and 
      relevant protocols in partnership with health discipine organisations, and so that 
      their applied deployment in pandemic stricken cities can be effected integrated 
      seamlessly within normal city environment planning activities and also in incident 
      situations like containing the current COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Targeting SARS-CoV-2 receptors as a means for reducing infectivity and improving 
      antiviral and immune response: an algorithm-based method for overcoming resistance 
      to antiviral agents.
PG  - 1397-1406
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1776161 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic caused by the novel 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, 
      and it has created a pressing global need for effective antiviral therapies against 
      it. COVID-19 disease pathogenesis is characterized by an initial virus-mediated 
      phase, followed by inappropriate hyperactivation of the immune system leading to 
      organ damage. Targeting of the SARS-CoV-2 viral receptors is being explored as a 
      therapeutic option for these patients. In this paper, we summarize several potential 
      receptors associated with the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss their 
      association with the immune-mediated inflammatory response. The potential for the 
      development of resistance towards antiviral drugs is also presented. An 
      algorithm-based platform to improve the efficacy of and overcome resistance to viral 
      receptor blockers through the introduction of personalized variability is described. 
      This method is designed to ensure sustained antiviral effectiveness when using 
      SARS-CoV-2 receptor blockers.

TI  - The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious 
      disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental 
      distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of 
      the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. 
      METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and 
      sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 
      to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems 
      (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and 
      treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher 
      rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), 
      anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed 
      mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) 
      and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than 
      non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of 
      suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking 
      (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, 
      adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The 
      case-control nature ofÂ the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a 
      possibility of bias related to self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical workers 
      had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for 
      these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the 
      timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on 
      the frontline.

AB  - An outbreak of respiratory illness which is proven to be infected by a 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) officially named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was 
      first detected in Wuhan, China and has spread rapidly in other parts of China as 
      well as other countries around the world, including Malaysia. The first case in 
      Malaysia was identified on 25 January 2020 and the number of cases continue to rise 
      since March 2020. Therefore, 2020 Malaysia Movement Control Order (MCO) was 
      implemented with the aim to isolate the source of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a 
      result, there were fewer number of motor vehicles on the road and the operation of 
      industries was suspended, ergo reducing emissions of hazardous air pollutants in the 
      atmosphere. We had acquired the Air Pollutant Index (API) data from the Department 
      of Environment Malaysia on hourly basis before and during the MCO with the aim to 
      track the changes of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) at 68 air quality monitoring 
      stations. It was found that the PM(2.5) concentrations showed a high reduction of up 
      to 58.4% during the MCO. Several red zone areas (>41 confirmed COVID-19 cases) had 
      also reduced of up to 28.3% in the PM(2.5) concentrations variation. The reduction 
      did not solely depend on MCO, thus the researchers suggest a further study 
      considering the influencing factors that need to be adhered to in the future.

AB  - The different stages of Covid-19 pandemic can be described by two key-variables: ICU 
      patients and deaths in hospitals. We propose simple models that can be used by 
      medical doctors and decision makers to predict the trends on both short-term and 
      long-term horizons. Daily updates of the models with real data allow forecasting 
      some key indicators for decision-making (an Excel file in the Supplemental material 
      allows computing them). These are beds allocation, residence time, doubling time, 
      rate of renewal, maximum daily rate of change (positive/negative), halfway points, 
      maximum plateaus, asymptotic conditions, and dates and time intervals when some key 
      thresholds are overtaken. Doubling time of ICU beds for Covid-19 emergency can be as 
      low as 2-3 days at the outbreak of the pandemic. The models allow identifying the 
      possible departure of the phenomenon from the predicted trend and thus can play the 
      role of early warning systems and describe further outbreaks.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global public health crisis. There is a pressing 
      need for evidence-based interventions to address the devastating clinical and public 
      health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chinese scientists supported by private 
      and government resources have adopted extensive efforts to identify effective drugs 
      against the virus. To date, a large number of clinical trials addressing various 
      aspects of COVID19 have been registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry 
      (ChiCTR), including more than 200 interventional studies. Under such an urgent 
      circumstance, the scope and quality of these clinical studies vary significantly. 
      Hence, this review aims to make a comprehensive analysis on the profiles of COVID-19 
      clinical trials registered in the ChiCTR, including a wide range of characteristics. 
      Our findings will provide a useful summary on these clinical studies since most of 
      these studies will encounter major challenges from the design to completion. It will 
      be a long road for the outcomes of these studies to be published and international 
      collaboration will help the ultimate goals of developing new vaccines and anti-viral 
      drugs.

AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the impact of demographic characteristics, 
      maladaptive personality traits and causal beliefs about COVID-19 on perceived 
      emotional problems in a sample of Italian community-dwelling adults (NÂ =Â 1043) in 
      the first month of the social distancing period due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 
      Italy. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis results showed that dysfunctional 
      personality domains and non-scientifically supported causal beliefs explained all 
      the variance that was originally explained by demographic variables (i.e., age and 
      gender). In particular, negative affectivity and detachment represented relevant 
      risk factors for reduced emotional well-being in our sample. A significant positive 
      association was observed also between emotional problems and supernatural causal 
      beliefs on the COVID-19 infection. Our data supported the importance of considering 
      the impact of quarantine measures on psychological well-being, while suggesting 
      possible risk factors related to individual differences in personality and causal 
      beliefs.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a new Coronavirus, with first reported human infections in 
      late 2019. COVID-19 has been officially declared as a universal pandemic by the 
      World Health Organization (WHO). The epidemiological characteristics of COVID-2019 
      have not been completely understood yet. More than 200,000 persons were killed 
      during this epidemic (till 1 May 2020). Therefore, developing forecasting models to 
      predict the spread of that epidemic is a critical issue. In this study, statistical 
      and artificial intelligence based approaches have been proposed to model and 
      forecast the prevalence of this epidemic in Egypt. These approaches are 
      autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and nonlinear autoregressive 
      artificial neural networks (NARANN). The official data reported by The Egyptian 
      Ministry of Health and Population of COVID-19 cases in the period between 1 March 
      and 10 May 2020 was used to train the models. The forecasted cases showed a good 
      agreement with officially reported cases. The obtained results of this study may 
      help the Egyptian decision-makers to put short-term future plans to face this 
      epidemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate disease activity in patients with relapsing-remitting MS 
      (RRMS) receiving rituximab with an extended dosing interval. METHODS: In the context 
      of COVID-19 pandemic, this was an interim analysis of an ongoing prospective 
      observational study of patients who were stable on rituximab for at least 6 months 
      and who had a planned extended dosing interval of 24 months. Only data for patients 
      with active RRMS before rituximab were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 177 patients 
      receiving rituximab, 33 had RRMS and MRI activity before rituximab and at least 8 
      months of follow-up after the last infusion. The mean (SD) age was 40 (14) years, 25 
      were females, the mean disease duration was 10 (6.8) years, the mean annual relapse 
      rate (ARR) before rituximab was 1.7 (1.3), and the median Expanded Disability Status 
      Scale (EDSS) score before rituximab was 4.5 (1-7). Before extended dosing, when 
      rituximab was infused every 6 months, the mean (SD) ARR decreased to 0.04 (0.1) (p < 
      0.0001) and the EDSS score to 4 (0-7) (p = 0.04). At the time of this analysis, the 
      median follow-up since the last infusion was 11 (8-31) months. No patient showed 
      relapse or disability progression. In total, 30 patients had at least 1 MRI 
      performed since the last infusion (median time between the last MRI and the last 
      infusion 10 [8-31] months). No MRI showed activity. The CD19(+) cell proportion was 
      >1% for 10 of 25 patients at the last count (median time 8 [6-25] months). 
      CONCLUSIONS: An extended dosing interval for rituximab for patients with stable MS 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with a low risk of disease activity.

AB  - A mathematical model has been created with the Systems Dynamics methodology. It is 
      based on a SIR model, with the addition of auxiliary and state variables that 
      represent hospital capacity, contacts, contacts with infected, deaths, giving, as a 
      result, a model of four stock variables. Similarly, using piecewise functions, it 
      was possible to model the "quarantines" or lockdowns, and the effectiveness of 
      reduction in the contacts, Results show the decrease in infected people due to the 
      quarantines. The model was simulated for a population of 100,000. The simulations 
      show trends of infections that could occur in three different scenarios: A) one 
      extended lockdown (60Â days), B) two medium lockdowns of 30Â days, with a 30-day smart 
      lockdown space, and C) an initial 40-day lockdown and then a 30-day smart lockdown. 
      All the lockdowns start on day 25 after the first reported infection. The model 
      presents a compact structure of broad understanding and successful capture of a 
      COVID-19 outbreak and therefore provides an overview to improve knowledge of 
      outbreak trends and quarantine effectiveness in reducing infection.

TI  - Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 
      pandemic due to technological barriers.
PG  - 100330

AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been responsible for the 
      devastation of hundreds of thousands of lives directly and has caused disruptions 
      globally. Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental 
      illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection 
      resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, 
      mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the 
      psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the 
      toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has 
      quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with 
      technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different 
      populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the 
      public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who 
      receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. AIMS: The aims 
      of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based 
      psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health 
      system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to 
      highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable 
      populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services 
      expeditiously. METHODS: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and 
      Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: Based off data collected from experience in a public 
      health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic 
      has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, 
      this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from 
      mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers 
      with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which 
      are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of 
      innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency 
      situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations 
      to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.

AB  - During the recent Covid-19 pandemic, additive Technology and Social Media were used 
      to tackle the shortage of Personal Protective Equipment. A literature review and a 
      social media listening software were employed to explore the number of the users 
      referring to specific keywords related to 3D printing and PPE. Additionally, the 
      QALY model was recruited to highlight the importance of the PPE usage. More than 7 
      billion users used the keyword covid or similar in the web while mainly Twitter and 
      Facebook were used as a world platform for PPE designs distribution through 
      individuals and more than 100 different 3D printable PPE designs were developed.

AB  - Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a WHO priority pathogen 
      for which vaccines are urgently needed. Using an immune-focusing approach, we 
      created self-assembling particles multivalently displaying critical regions of the 
      MERS-CoV spike protein âfusion peptide, heptad repeat 2, and receptor binding domain 
      (RBD) â and tested their immunogenicity and protective capacity in rabbits. Using a 
      "plug-and-display" SpyTag/SpyCatcher system, we coupled RBD to lumazine synthase 
      (LS) particles producing multimeric RBD-presenting particles (RBD-LS). RBD-LS 
      vaccination induced antibody responses of high magnitude and quality (avidity, 
      MERS-CoV neutralizing capacity, and mucosal immunity) with cross-clade 
      neutralization. The antibody responses were associated with blocking viral 
      replication and upper and lower respiratory tract protection against MERS-CoV 
      infection in rabbits. This arrayed multivalent presentation of the viral RBD using 
      the antigen-SpyTag/LS-SpyCatcher is a promising MERS-CoV vaccine candidate and this 
      platform may be applied for the rapid development of vaccines against other emerging 
      viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.

      affected by cutaneous and mucosal adverse events during the COVID-19 pandemic: an 
      Italian experience.
PG  - 3991-3993
LID - 10.1007/s00520-020-05563-1 [doi]
AB  - Stringent measures have been taken to contain COVID-19 spread, limiting access only 
      for urgent visits, surgery procedures, or hospitalizations and using teledermatology 
      services for non-urgent cases. Management of oncological patients affected by 
      chemo-, immune-, and radiotherapy-related cutaneous and mucosal adverse events is a 
      challenge. Firstly because of the differential diagnosis of cutaneous rash (e.g., 
      drug-related rash or paraviral exanthema). Secondly, oncological patients can suffer 
      from xerosis, pruritus, and mucositis that contribute to cutaneous and mucosal 
      barrier lesions, thus becoming vulnerable site for viral or bacterial colonization. 
      These lesions can also be aggravated by the use of protective mask and gloves. Here, 
      we report also our results of a teledermatological survey on 87 oncological 
      patients, where the health status of oncological patients referred to our dedicated 
      clinic was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, it is fundamental that 
      oncological patients are followed up by their dermatologists even if the clinics are 
      closed. Teledermatology represents a crucial means of communication. Patients can 
      contact the dermatological staff by emails and telephone, 24Â h a day, 7Â days a week, 
      for video calls and dermatological consultations.

TI  - COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations 
      from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry.
PG  - 1062-1067
LID - S0165-0327(20)31272-6 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with 
      comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug 
      interactions. METHODS: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients 
      with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the 
      existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in 
      consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: 
      Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should 
      be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with 
      some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, 
      lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are 
      in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs 
      co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of 
      adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a 
      psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG 
      monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, 
      olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be 
      avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be 
      maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support 
      should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: Most 
      recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative 
      approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with 
      psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis 
      considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving 
      COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and 
      should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include 
      an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.

AB  - I read with great interest the recently published article by Li et al.,(1) which 
      suggests that a risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      infection may be significantly higher in subjects with blood-group A and 
      significantly lower in those with blood-group O. This case-control study compared 
      the ABO blood-group distribution in 265 cases with coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) at the Central Hospital of Wuhan with that in 3694 heathy controls.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been appreciated as a major regulator of 
      blood pressure, but has more recently been recognized as a mechanism for modulating 
      inflammation as well. While there has been concern in COVID-19 patients over the use 
      of drugs that target this system, the RAS has not been explored fully as a druggable 
      target. The abbreviated description of the RAS suggests that its dysregulation may 
      be at the center of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an urgent search for effective 
      interventions. SARS-CoV-2 mortality/morbidity risk increases with age and for those 
      chronic disease co-morbidities, both of which are associated with lower zinc status, 
      as is the risk of infection. METHODS: Rapid review methods will be applied to a 
      systematic review of zinc for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and viral 
      respiratory tract infections in humans. Included are published studies reporting 
      randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compare zinc intervention to 
      placebo and/or other comparator interventions. English and Chinese language 
      databases will be searched for primary studies of viral respiratory tract infections 
      and clinical trial registries for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Due to concerns about 
      indirectness, studies evaluating non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections will be rated 
      down by one level, and non-specific or confirmed non-coronavirus viral infections 
      will be rated down by two levels. Review constraints include (1) using Google 
      translate when screening articles published in languages other than English or 
      Chinese and limited translation (2) following calibration, only one reviewer will 
      screen articles, extract data, appraise quality and conduct the analysis, (3) 
      prioritising data extraction and meta-analyses of SARS-CoV-2 studies and critical 
      outcomes of other viral infections, followed by high risk groups and (4) reporting 
      important preliminary findings prior to peer review if necessary. DISCUSSION: The 
      application of these rapid review methods and broadening the inclusion criteria to 
      include other coronavirus-related viral respiratory tract infections aims to enable 
      a timely evidence appraisal of priority research questions and dissemination of 
      results. STUDY REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020182044.

AB  - The emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with the outbreak of viral pneumonia in 
      China is ongoing worldwide. There are no approved antiviral therapies to treat this 
      viral disease. Here we examined the antiviral abilities of three broad-spectrum 
      antiviral compounds gemcitabine, lycorine and oxysophoridine against SARS-CoV-2 in 
      cell culture. We found that all three tested compounds inhibited viral replication 
      in Vero-E6 cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. The antiviral effect of gemcitabine 
      was suppressed efficiently by the cytidine nucleosides. Additionally, combination of 
      gemcitabine with oxysophoridine had an additive antiviral effect against SARS-CoV-2. 
      Our results demonstrate that broad-spectrum antiviral compounds may have a priority 
      for the screening of antiviral compounds against newly emerging viruses to control 
      viral infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, 
      healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to 
      examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the 
      COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological 
      morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW 
      in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were 
      determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / 
      Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation 
      between job title and contact history was analyzed. RESULTS: We received 958 of 
      effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female 
      participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that 
      of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and 
      depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work 
      experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, 
      job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, 
      intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent 
      risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the 
      independent risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic has 
      induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and 
      depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a wide spectrum of disease severity from 
      mild upper respiratory symptoms to respiratory failure. The role of neutralizing 
      antibody (NAb) response in disease progression remains elusive. This study 
      determined the seroprevalence of 733 non-COVID-19 individuals from April 2018 to 
      February 2020 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and compared the 
      neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses of eight COVID-19 patients admitted to the 
      intensive care unit (ICU) with those of 42 patients not admitted to the ICU. We 
      found that NAb against SARS-CoV-2 was not detectable in any of the anonymous serum 
      specimens from the 733 non-COVID-19 individuals. The peak serum geometric mean NAb 
      titer was significantly higher among the eight ICU patients than the 42 non-ICU 
      patients (7280 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1468-36099]) vs (671 [95% CI, 
      368-1223]). Furthermore, NAb titer increased significantly at earlier infection 
      stages among ICU patients than among non-ICU patients. The median number of days to 
      reach the peak Nab titers after symptoms onset was shorter among the ICU patients 
      (17.6) than that of the non-ICU patients (20.1). Multivariate analysis showed that 
      oxygen requirement and fever during admission were the only clinical factors 
      independently associated with higher NAb titers. Our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 
      was unlikely to have silently spread before the COVID-19 emergence in Hong Kong. ICU 
      patients had an accelerated and augmented NAb response compared to non-ICU patients, 
      which was associated with disease severity. Further studies are required to 
      understand the relationship between high NAb response and disease severity.

AB  - Since Dec 2019, China has experienced an outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus, 
      2019-nCoV. A travel ban was implemented for Wuhan, Hubei on Jan 23 to slow down the 
      outbreak. We found a significant positive correlation between population influx from 
      Wuhan and confirmed cases in other cities across China (R(2)â=â0.85, Pâ<â0.001), 
      especially cities in Hubei (R(2)â=â0.88, Pâ<â0.001). Removing the travel restriction 
      would have increased 118% (91%-172%) of the overall cases for the coming week, and a 
      travel ban taken three days or a week earlier would have reduced 47% (26%-58%) and 
      83% (78%-89%) of the early cases. We would expect a 61% (48%-92%) increase of 
      overall cumulative cases without any restrictions on returning residents, and 11% 
      (8%-16%) increase if the travel ban stays in place for Hubei. Cities from Yangtze 
      River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Capital Economic Circle regions are at higher 
      risk.

AB  - Amidst the pandemic that has mesmerized the entire world, as it has not spared 
      anyone according to any specific characteristic, some conditions have, in fact, 
      emerged as risk factors for a complicated evolution of COVID-19. Older age, 
      cardiovascular disease including hypertension, diabetes and pulmonary disease, have 
      been associated with more severe presentations and/or adverse prognosis. In this 
      letter to the editor, we propose that the link between cardiovascular and metabolic 
      diseases and the higher incidence and worse prognosis of COVID-19 patients is the 
      (micro) vascular endothelium.

TI  - A multicriteria approach for risk assessment of Covid-19 in urban district lockdown.
PG  - 104862
LID - 10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104862 [doi]
AB  - At the beginning of 2020, the spread of a new strand of Coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 
      (COVID-19) raised the interest of the scientific community about the risk assessment 
      related to the viral infection. The contagion became pandemic in few months forcing 
      many Countries to declare lockdown status. In this context of quarantine, all 
      commercial and productive activities are suspended, and many Countries are 
      experiencing a serious crisis. To this aim, the understanding of risk of contagion 
      in every urban district is fundamental for governments and administrations to 
      establish reopening strategies. This paper proposes the calibration of an index able 
      to predict the risk of contagion in urban districts in order to support the 
      administrations in identifying the best strategies to reduce or restart the local 
      activities during lockdown conditions. The objective regards the achievement of a 
      useful tool to predict the risk of contagion by considering socio-economic data such 
      as the presence of activities, companies, institutions and number of infections in 
      urban districts. The proposed index is based on a factorial formula, simple and easy 
      to be applied by practitioners, calibrated by using an optimization-based procedure 
      and exploiting data of 257 urban districts of Apulian region (Italy). Moreover, a 
      comparison with a more refined analysis, based on the training of Artificial Neural 
      Networks, is performed in order to take into account the non-linearity of the 
      phenomenon. The investigation quantifies the influence of each considered parameter 
      in the risk of contagion useful to obtain risk analysis and forecast scenarios.

PG  - 1354-1355

AB  - We report a 35-year-old female nurse who possibly received the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
      during the blood sampling of a 35-year-old male patient initially suspected as a 
      dengue infection. The patient had mild thrombocytopenia and positive dengue IgG and 
      IgM whereas the clinicians were not aware of the possibility of false-positive 
      dengue serology revealed in the published case report from Singapore. The nurse put 
      on a pair of gloves but did not wear a mask during the only encounter with this 
      patient. This nosocomial transmission raised a safety concern among healthcare 
      professionals in an area with a relatively low Covid-19 prevalence, especially when 
      the clinical and laboratory characteristics could be confused with other viral 
      infections.

PG  - 100226
LID - 10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.100226 [doi]
AB  - The present study provides an overview of the food related behavior of the Spanish 
      population during the confinement period due to the Covid-19 sanitary emergency. A 
      national survey was responded by 600 volunteers, who answered questions related to 
      food consumption, home-food and cooking related habits (F&C), and the Spanish 
      version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. In general, most consumers could 
      be considered "External eaters"; F&C questionnaire allowed segmenting the population 
      in "low-cooking engagement", "health -concerned" and "health-disregarded" groups. 
      These consumers' segments reported different behavior, highlighting, for example, 
      the increase of snacks and ultra-processed food consumption of the 
      health-disregarded group.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Assimilating and disseminating information during the novel 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been challenging. The purpose of this review 
      is to identify specific threats to the validity of the COVID-19 literature and to 
      recommend resources for practicing rheumatologists and their patients. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: The COVID-19 literature has rapidly expanded and includes 17â998 
      publications through May of 2020, 1543 of which also address rheumatic 
      disease-related topics. Specific obstacles to acquiring high-quality information 
      have arisen, including 'pandemic research exceptionalism' and a 'parallel pandemic' 
      of misinformation. Unique challenges to rheumatologists include specific interest in 
      antirheumatic disease therapies and a paucity of rheumatology-specific information. 
      Patients with rheumatic diseases have faced shortages of critical medications and a 
      lack of information tailored to their health conditions and medications. SUMMARY: We 
      recommend rheumatologists develop a system to acquire high-quality information and 
      offer guiding principles for triaging specific resources, which include relevance, 
      accessibility, credibility, timeliness, and trustworthiness. The same principles can 
      be applied to selecting patient oriented resources. Specific trustworthy resources 
      are recommended.

TI  - Early-onset symptomatic neonatal COVID-19 infection with high probability of 
      vertical transmission.
LID - 10.1007/s15010-020-01493-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few reports of COVID-19 in neonates and most are suspected to 
      be due to postnatal transmission. Vertical transmission has been proven in only a 
      couple of cases so far. METHODS: We describe early-onset, severe COVID-19 disease in 
      a neonate with very strong evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: 
      A COVID-19 suspected mother, who tested negative by RT-PCR for COVID, but tested 
      positive for SARS-CoV-2 by serology, delivered a term baby. The neonate was kept in 
      strict isolation. Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 on umbilical stump, placenta, and 
      nasopharyngeal aspirate of the neonate, collected at birth were positive. On day 2, 
      the neonate developed clinical features of COVID in the form of fever, poor feeding, 
      and hyperbilirubenemia along with elevated inflammatory markers. Antibiotics were 
      started empirically pending cultures. Blood, CSF, and urine cultures were sterile. 
      Baby tested RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two more occasions before testing 
      positive for antibodies and was discharged on day 21 of life. CONCLUSION: This 
      report highlights a very strong possibility of vertical transmission of COVID-19 
      from a mildly symptomatic, RT-PCR negative but antibody-positive mother with 
      significant symptomatic, early-onset neonatal infection.

AB  - Regrettably, after a first moment of appreciation and praise of the citizens for 
      healthcare personnel facing COVID 19 pandemia, numerous episodes of actions taken 
      against them on the issue of their legal liability followed. Impelling is to start 
      an argumentation on this problem that aims to establish a shared conduct in dealing 
      with them. The authors propose a basis for discussion on which to begin a 
      constructive debate.

PG  - R357-R374
LID - ERC-20-0229 [pii]
LID - 10.1530/ERC-20-0229 [doi]
AB  - Substantial management changes in endocrine-related malignancies have been required 
      as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a draconian reduction in the 
      screening of asymptomatic subjects, delay in planned surgery and radiotherapy for 
      primary tumors deemed to be indolent, and dose reductions and/or delays in 
      initiation of some systemic therapies. An added key factor has been a 
      patient-initiated delay in the presentation because of the fear of viral infection. 
      Patterns of clinical consultation have changed, including a greater level of virtual 
      visits, physical spacing, masking, staffing changes to ensure a COVID-free 
      population and significant changes in patterns of family involvement. While this has 
      occurred to improve safety from COVID-19 infection, the implications for cancer 
      outcomes have not yet been defined. Based on prior epidemics and financial 
      recessions, it is likely that delayed presentation and treatment of high-grade 
      malignancy will be associated with worse cancer outcomes. Cancer patients are also 
      at increased risk from COVID-19 infection compared to the general population. 
      Pandemic management strategies for patients with tumors of breast, prostate, 
      thyroid, parathyroid and adrenal gland are reviewed.

TI  - Autophagy and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Apossible smart targeting of the autophagy 
      pathway.
PG  - 805-810
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2020.1780088 [doi]
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak resulted 
      in 5,993,317 confirmed cases worldwide with 365,394 confirmed deaths (as of May 
      29(th), 2020, WHO). The molecular mechanism of virus infection and spread in the 
      body is not yet disclosed, but studies on other betacoronaviruses show that, upon 
      cell infection, these viruses inhibit macroautophagy/autophagy flux and cause the 
      accumulation of autophagosomes. No drug has yet been approved for the treatment of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, preclinical investigations suggested repurposing of 
      several FDA-approved drugs for clinical trials. Half of these drugs are modulators 
      of the autophagy pathway. Unexpectedly, instead of acting by directly antagonizing 
      the effects of viruses, these drugs appear to function by suppressing autophagy 
      flux. Based on the established cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, we 
      speculate that over-accumulation of autophagosomes activates an apoptotic pathway 
      that results in apoptotic death of the infected cells and disrupts the virus 
      replication cycle. However, administration of the suggested drugs are associated 
      with severe adverse effects due to their off-target accumulation. Nanoparticle 
      targeting of autophagy at the sites of interest could be a powerful tool to 
      efficiently overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection while avoiding the common adverse effects 
      of these drugs.

TI  - Does culture matter social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic?
PG  - 104872
LID - 10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104872 [doi]
AB  - This paper is the first to examine the role of the cultural dimension in practising 
      social distancing across the world. By drawing the data from the Google COVID-19 
      community mobility reports and the Hofstede cultural factors for 58 countries over 
      the period from 16 February to 29 March 2020, we find that countries with higher 
      'Uncertainty Avoidance Index' predict the lower proportion of people gathering in 
      public such as retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, 
      workplaces. However, we do not find any predictive factor in having a relationship 
      with the percentage of citizens staying in their residential areas. Our results are 
      robust by adding the control variable as the wealth status, GDP per capita. Hence, 
      this paper suggests some effective communications to contain the COVID-19 pandemic 
      by emphasizing the role of uncertainties.

TI  - Does immunosuppressive treatment entail an additional risk for children with 
      rheumatic diseases? A survey-based study in the era of COVID-19.
LID - 10.1007/s00296-020-04663-9 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the research was to further extend current knowledge of whether severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      entails a risk for children with various rheumatic diseases under immunosuppressive 
      treatment. Telephone survey was administered by conducting interviews with the 
      parents from May 1, 2020 to May 20, 2020. A message containing a link to the actual 
      questionnaire was sent to their phones simultaneously. The medical records of the 
      patients were reviewed for gathering information about demographic data, clinical 
      follow-up, and treatments. Patients who were followed-up under immunosuppressive 
      treatment (nâ=â439) were attempted to be contacted. The diagnostic distribution of 
      patients (nâ=â414) eligible for the study was as follows: juvenile idiopathic 
      arthritis (JIA) (nâ=â243, 58.7%), autoinflammatory diseases (nâ=â109, 26.3%), 
      connective tissue diseases (nâ=â51, 12.3%), and vasculitis (nâ=â11, 2.7%). In the 
      entire cohort, the mean age was 12âÂ±â4.7Â years, and 54.1% (nâ=â224) were female. 
      Nine patients have attended the hospital for COVID-19 evaluation, 6 of whom were in 
      close contact with confirmed cases. One patient with seronegative polyarticular JIA, 
      previously prescribed methotrexate and receiving leflunomide during pandemic was 
      identified to be diagnosed with COVID-19. None, including the confirmed case, had 
      any severe symptoms. More than half of the patients with household exposure did not 
      require hospitalization as they were asymptomatic. Although circumstances such as 
      compliance in social distancing policy, transmission patterns, attitude following 
      contact may have influenced the results, immunosuppressive treatment does not seem 
      to pose an additional risk in terms of COVID-19.

TI  - Assessing air quality changes in large cities during COVID-19 lockdowns: The impacts

LID - S0048-9697(20)32696-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139179 [doi]
AB  - Number of cities worlwide experienced air quality improvements during COVID-19 
      lockdowns; however, such changes may have been different in places with major 
      contributions from nontraffic related sources. In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine 
      came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case 
      was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown 
      from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27Â days), on the concentrations of air pollutants 
      in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM(2.5), NO(2), SO(2), CO, O(3), and BTEX were 
      compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, 
      the PM(2.5) concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6-34% 
      compared to the average on the same days in 2018-2019, and still, it exceeded WHO 
      daily limit values for 18Â days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and 
      NO(2) concentrations by 49% and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O(3) levels by 
      15% compared to the prior 17Â days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene 
      and toluene were 2-3 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 
      2015-2019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown 
      due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial 
      effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results 
      demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, 
      which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly 
      coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as 
      possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses.

TI  - The resumption of sports competitions after COVID-19 lockdown: The case of the 
      Spanish football league.
PG  - 109964
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109964 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we present a stochastic discrete-time SEIR 
      Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recoveredmodel adapted to describe the propagation of 
      COVID-19 during a football tournament. Specifically, we are concerned about the 
      re-start of the Spanish national football league, La Liga, which is currently -May 
      2020- stopped with 11 fixtures remaining. Our model includes two additional states 
      of an individual, confined and quarantined, which are reached when an individual 
      presents COVID-19 symptoms or has undergone a virus test with a positive result. The 
      model also accounts for the interaction dynamics of players, considering three 
      different sources of infection: the player social circle, the contact with his/her 
      team colleagues during training sessions, and the interaction with rivals during a 
      match. Our results highlight the influence of the days between matches, the 
      frequency of virus tests and their sensitivity on the number of players infected at 
      the end of the season. Following our findings, we finally propose a variety of 
      strategies to minimise the probability that COVID-19 propagates in case the season 
      of La Liga was re-started after the current lockdown.

AB  - COVID-19 is a significant worldwide challenge to many healthcare systems. In Trauma 
      and Orthopaedics, there has been a significant change in the workload but 
      departments have been compelled to change their practice in order to match the 
      demand, as well as respond to the escalating situation of COVID. Some guidance is 
      available on these changes from bodies such as the National Health Service (NHS), 
      Public Health England and the British Orthopaedic Association (BOA). We have 
      implemented certain changes in our university district general hospital trauma and 
      orthopaedic department with regard to staff roles, outpatient and inpatient care and 
      operative protocols. We aim to present some of these changes and their effects on 
      patient care in an attempt to share these with colleagues who may face similar 
      pressures and make some recommendations to help others prepare for a possible second 
      wave of COVID-19.

AB  - In this paper, we have conducted analysis based on data obtained from National 
      Institute of Health (NIH) - Islamabad and produced a forecast of COVID-19 confirmed 
      cases as well as the number of deaths and recoveries in Pakistan using the 
      Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA). The fitted forecasting 
      models revealed high exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases, deaths and 
      recoveries in Pakistan. Based on our model prediction the number of confirmed cases 
      will be increased by 2.7 times, 95% prediction interval for the number of cases at 
      the end of May 2020Â =Â (5681 to 33079). There could be up to 500 deaths, 95% 
      prediction intervalÂ =Â (168 to 885) and there could be eightfold increase in the 
      number of recoveries, 95% prediction intervalÂ =Â (2391 to 16126). The forecasting 
      results of COVID-19 are alarming for May in Pakistan. The health officials and 
      government should adopt new strategies to control the pandemic from further spread 
      until a proper treatment or vaccine is developed.

AB  - The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 
      2019, is considered a major public concern that propagates steadily by the increased 
      number of the infected cases and the mortality rate. In this article, we provide a 
      brief review for Orthopedic surgeons as regard COVID-19 virus microbiology, 
      epidemiology, clinical picture, and diagnosis. Moreover, what measures should be 
      taken amid this pandemic to assess its control, maintain the urgent duties, and 
      protect health care workers (HCW) are also discussed.

TI  - Herbal medicine for the management of COVID-19 during the medical observation 
      period: A review of guidelines.
PG  - 100465
LID - 10.1016/j.imr.2020.100465 [doi]
LID - 100465
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical observation period is a period of 14 days after any exposure to 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred. This review aimed to summarize and 
      analyze the herbs and herbal formulae recommended by available guidelines. METHODS: 
      A total of 14 sources were searched for potential guidelines that provide herbal 
      medicine treatment for the medical observation period of COVID-19. We summarized and 
      analyzed the recommended herbal formulae and performed a network analysis to 
      identify the relationship between herbs. RESULTS: We found 9 guidelines that provide 
      herbal formula for medical observation based on clinical manifestation. There are 12 
      herbal formulae with a total of 53 herbs recommended by the guidelines. The result 
      of our network analysis showed that the herb Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (Chen Pi) 
      strongly paired with the herb Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma (Gan Cao). CONCLUSION: 
      This review briefly summarized the usage of herbal medicine for the medical

AB  - The outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a public health emergency that had 
      caused disastrous results in more than 100 countries. The ability to detect disease 
      outbreaks in the early stages is a key component of efficient disease control and 
      prevention. With the increased availability of electronic health-care data and 
      spatial analysis techniques, there is great potential to develop algorithms to 
      enable more effective disease surveillance. The research focuses to develop a 
      transparent user-friendly method to simulate the outbreak data. The paper describes 
      the GIS tools to identify and define the field of investigation which requires 
      consideration of the strengths and limitations of data collection instruments, 
      facility of locational data collection, accuracy of locational data, and pertinent 
      attributes for understanding disease risk. Using such information, it is quite easy 
      for authorities to locate the highly effected area and take appropriate actions in 
      that particular areas. However, GIS techniques, resources, and methods can be used 
      in Pakistan for more effective investigation of vulnerable geographical locations.

AB  - Background: With the rapid global spread of the acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2, urgent health-care measures have been implemented. We describe the 
      organizational process in setting up a coronavirus disease 2019 triage unit in a 
      Swiss tertiary care hospital. Methods: Our triage unit was set-up outside of the 
      main hospital building and consists of three areas: 1. Pre-triage, 2. Triage, and 3. 
      Triage plus. The Pre-triage check-points identify any potential COVID-19-infected 
      patients and re-direct them to the main Triage area where trained medical staff 
      screen which patients undergo diagnostic testing. If testing is indicated, 
      nasopharyngeal swabs are performed. If patients require further investigations, they 
      are referred to Triage plus. At this stage, patients are then discharged home after 
      additional testing or admitted to the hospital for management. Observations: A total 
      of 1265 patients were screened between 10 March 2020 and 12 April 2020 at our Triage 
      unit. Of these, 112 (8.9%) tested positive. 73 (65%) of the positively-tested 
      patients were female and 39 (35%) were male. The mean age for all patients was 43.8 
      years (SD 16.3 years). Distinguishing between genders, mean age for females was 41.1 
      (SD 16.5) and mean age for males was 48.6 (SD 14.9), with females being 
      significantly younger than males (pâ<â0.001). Conclusion: Our triage unit was set-up 
      as part of a large-scale restructuring process. Current challenges include low 
      sensitivity for test results as well as limited staff and resources. We hope that 
      our experience will help other health care institutions develop similar triage 
      systems.

AB  - This essay applies the "ultimate broadening of the concept of marketing" for 
      designing and implementing interventions in public laws and policy, national and 
      local regulations, and everyday lives of individuals. The ultimate broadening of the 
      concept of marketing: Marketing is any activity, message, emotion, or behavior by 
      someone, firm, organization, government, community, or brand executed consciously or 
      nonconsciously that may stimulate an observable or non-observable activity, emotion, 
      attitude, belief, or thought by someone else, group, organization, firm or 
      community. The broadening definition applies to the current interventions by 
      national and state/provincial governments as well as healthcare facilities, medical 
      science facilities, firms, and individuals to mitigate and eliminate the impact of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Framing interventions as experiments is helpful in improving 
      the quality of their designs, implementing them successfully, and validly 
      interpreting their effectiveness. In January and February 2020, a few nations were 
      exemplars for accurately forecasting the coming disaster of COVID-19 as a cause of 
      illness and death and in designing/implementing effective mitigating strategies: 
      Denmark, Finland, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, and Vietnam. While the 
      COVID-19 prevention intervention tests now being run for several promising vaccines 
      are true experiments, the researchers analyzing the data from these interventions 
      may need prompting to examine the efficacy of each vaccine tested by modeling 
      demographic subgroups for the members in the treatment and placebo groups in the 
      randomized control trials.

      COVID-19 Patients.
PG  - 827-835
LID - 10.1177/0885066620940259 [doi]
AB  - In the 5 months since initial reports of COVID-19 came to light, the death toll due 
      to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly increased. The morbidity and mortality of the infection 
      varies based upon patient age, comorbid conditions, viral load, and the availability 
      of effective treatments. Findings from limited autopsies, clinical observations, and 
      laboratory data suggest that high cytokine levels and a procoagulant state can 
      precipitate acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome 
      in critically ill patients. To complicate matters, comorbidities may affect the 
      response to medical treatments currently in use, all of which are still in trial 
      phase. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) merits consideration in the treatment of 
      critically ill COVID-19 patients and is an avenue for clinical trials to pursue. If 
      efficacious, faster recovery of patients may lead to shorter intensive care unit 
      stays and less time on mechanical ventilation. Herein, we briefly discuss some of 
      the various approaches currently being investigated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 
      with a focus on potential benefits of TPE for selected critically ill patients.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major healthcare disaster in the modern 
      times. Healthcare services must adapt to effectively juggle between pandemic 
      management and maintenance of business-as-usual services so that both COVID-19 and 
      non-COVID-19 patients receive appropriate clinical care. We share our experience of 
      significant cardiac rhythm abnormalities seen in COVID-19 patients in Singapore, how 
      the viral pandemic has affected the cardiac electrophysiology and pacing service in 
      a large acute care general hospital and the steps taken to alleviate the negative 
      impact.

TI  - Impact of Personal Protective Equipment on Surgical Performance During the COVID-19 
      Pandemic.
PG  - 2842-2847

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic has exposed 
      surgeons to hazardous working conditions, imposing the need for personal protective 
      equipment (PPE) use during surgery. The use of such equipment may affect their 
      non-technical skills, augment fatigue, and affect performance. This study aimed to 
      assess the surgeons' perceptions of the impact of wearing PPE during emergency 
      surgery throughout the pandemic. METHODS: An international cooperation group 
      conducted an anonymous online survey among surgeons from over 30 countries, to 
      assess perceptions about the impact of PPE use on non-technical skills, overall 
      comfort, decision making, and surgical performance during emergency surgery on 
      COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Responses to the survey (134) were received from 
      surgeons based on 26 countries. The vast majority (72%) were males. More than half 
      of the respondents (54%) felt that their surgical performance was hampered with PPE. 
      Visual impairment was reported by 63%, whereas 54% had communication impediments. 
      Less than half (48%) felt protected with the use of PPE, and the same proportion 
      perceived that the use of such equipment influenced their decision making. Decreased 
      overall comfort was cited by 66%, and 82% experienced increased surgical fatigue. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons perceived impediment for both visibility and communication, 
      and other non-technical skills while using PPE on emergency surgery in COVID-19 
      patients. Their perceived lack of protection and comfort and increased fatigue may 
      have inhibited their optimal surgical performance. More attention should be placed 
      in the design of more user-friendly equipment, given the possibility of a second 
      wave of the pandemic.

AB  - While the COVID-19 epidemic occurred since December 2019, as of end April 2020, no 
      treatment has been validated or invalidated by accurate clinical trials. Use of 
      hydroxychloroquine has been popularised on mass media and put forward as a valid 
      treatment option without strong evidence of efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has 
      its own side effects, some of which are very serious like acute haemolysis in 
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient patients. Side effects may be 
      worse than the disease itself. Belgian national treatment guidelines recommend the 
      use of HCQ in mild to severe COVID-19 disease. As opinions, politics, media and 
      beliefs are governing COVID-19 therapy, performance of randomised controlled blinded 
      clinical trials became difficult. Results of sound clinical trials are eagerly 
      awaited. We report a case of acute haemolysis leading to admission in intensive care 
      unit and renal failure in a patient with uncovered G6PD deficiency.

AB  - In December 2019, many pneumonia cases with unidentified sources appeared in Wuhan, 
      Hubei, China, with clinical symptoms like viral pneumonia. Deep sequencing analysis 
      of samples from lower respiratory tract revealed a novel coronavirus, called 2019 
      novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Currently there is a rapid global spread. World 
      Health Organization declare the disease a pandemic condition. The pathologic source 
      of this disease was a new RNA virus from Coronaviridae family, which was named 
      COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein 
      expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface followed by 
      clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex. SARS-CoV-2 enters 
      the cells through endocytosis process, which is possibly facilitated, via a pH 
      dependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins. Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 
      exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate and 
      spread through the entire lung. Endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and 
      internalization is critical. After entering the cells, it possibly activates or 
      hijack many intracellular pathways in favor of its replication. In the current 
      opinion article, we will explain the possible involvement of unfolded protein 
      response as a cellular stress response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 will constantly sweep its tracks: a vaccine containing CpG motifs in 
      'lasso' for the multi-faced virus.
PG  - 801-812
LID - 10.1007/s00011-020-01377-3 [doi]
AB  - During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global ratio between the dead and the 
      survivors is approximately 1 to 10, which has put humanity on high alert and 
      provided strong motivation for the intensive search for vaccines and drugs. It is 
      already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to that 
      used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop improved 
      vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly mutable 
      coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this article, using well-known RNA viruses (HIV, 
      influenza viruses, HCV) as examples, we consider the main successes and failures in 
      creating primarily highly effective vaccines. The experience accumulated dealing 
      with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the fight against COVID-19 
      will be difficult and lengthy. The most effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will 
      be those able to form highly effective memory cells for both humoral (memory B 
      cells) and cellular (cross-reactive antiviral memory T cells) immunity. 
      Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most 
      promising solutions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 
      'universal' vaccines based on conservative SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences 
      (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the 
      composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides 
      (ODN), which can be effective for long periods of use. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 
      vaccine based on a lasso-like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction 
      containing CpG motifs and the antigen-presenting unique ACG-containing genome 
      sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that CpG dinucleotides are the most rare 
      dinucleotides in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, and 
      hypothesized that their higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted 
      increased lethality to the host, causing a 'cytokine storm' in people who 
      overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific Toll-like receptors in a 
      manner similar to TLR9-CpG ODN interactions. Interestingly, the virus strains 
      sequenced in China (Wuhan) in February 2020 contained on average one CpG 
      dinucleotide more in their genome than the later strains from the USA (New York) 
      sequenced in May 2020. Obviously, during the first steps of the microevolution of 
      SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, natural selection tends to select viral genomes 
      containing fewer CpG motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response, so 
      the infected person has moderate symptoms and spreads SARS-CoV-2 more readily. 
      However, in our opinion, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are also capable of 
      preparing the host immune system for the coronavirus infection and should be present 
      in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as strong adjuvants.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and imaging 
      features of patients with COVID-19 in Henan Province People's Hospital. Methods: The 
      epidemiology, clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiologic data of 49 patients with 
      COVID-19 infection admitted to the department of infectious disease in our hospital 
      from January 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. All 
      analyses were performed with SPSS software, version 22.0. Results: A total of 49 
      patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, of which 28 were ordinary, 16 were severe, and 
      5 were critical in disease severity. The average ages of the 3 groups were (46Â±19) , 
      (60Â±16) and (68Â±20) years, with statistical differences (P=0.015). Common symptoms 
      at the onset were fever (41 patients), dry cough (35 patients), and fatigue (21 
      patients). Epidemiological investigations found that 31 (63%) patients had direct or 
      indirect contact with confirmed cases, and 14 cases were family clustered. 
      Laboratory test results showed that the lymphocyte counts progressively decreased 
      [0.85 (0.5-1.6) Ã10(9)/L,0.51 (0.4-0.9) Ã10(9)/L and 0.43 (0.47-0.61) Ã10(9)/L, 
      respectively], while LDH [162 (145.1-203.5) U/L,265 (195.3-288.4) U/L and 387 
      (312.3-415.5) U/L, respectively] and D-dimer [0.15 (0.09-0.40) mg/L,0.4 (0.2-0.6) 
      mg/L and 0.9 (0.5-1.4) mg/L, respectively] were significantly increased (P<0.05), in 
      all the 3 groups. The levels of IL-6 [(43.2Â±15.4) Î¼g/L, (78.5Â±31.2) Î¼g/L and 
      (132.4Â±47.9) Î¼g/L, respectively] and IL-10 [(3.5Â±3.2) Î¼g/L, (7.6Â±6.4) Î¼g/L and 
      (9.4Â±7.2) Î¼g/L respectively] increased significantly with disease severity. 
      Pulmonary imaging of ordinary patients mainly showed unilateral or bilateral 
      multiple infiltrates, while severe and critically ill patients showed diffuse 
      exudation and consolidation of both lungs, and a few patients showed signs of "white 
      lungs". Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 has a definite history of contact with 
      diagnosed patients, and has family aggregation. The clinical symptoms were mainly 
      fever and dry cough. Laboratory results showed that lymphocyte count, LDH, D-dimer, 
      interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels had a significant correlation with the 
      severity of the disease, which could be used as markers for disease progression and 
      prognosis. Pulmonary imaging showed unilateral or bilateral ground glass 
      infiltration. In severe and critically ill patients, diffuse infiltration and 
      consolidation or even "white lung" were present.

TI  - Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human kidney reveals the presence of ACE2 
      receptor: A potential pathway of COVID-19 infection.
PG  - e1442

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus called SARS-Cov-2, which shared 82% similarity of 
      genome sequence with SARS-CoV, was found in Wuhan in late December of 2019, causing 
      an epidemic outbreak of novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia with dramatically 
      increasing number of cases. Several organs are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. 
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) was reported in parts of case-studies reporting 
      characteristics of COVID-19 patients. This study aimed at analyzing the potential 
      route of SARS-Cov-2 entry and mechanism at cellular level. METHOD: Single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology was used to obtain evidence of potential route and 
      ACE2 expressing cell in renal system for underlying pathogenesis of kidney injury 
      caused by COVID-19. The whole process was performed under R with Seurat packages. 
      Canonical marker genes were used to annotate different types of cells. RESULTS: Ten 
      different clusters were identified and ACE2 was mainly expressed in proximal tubule 
      and glomerular parietal epithelial cells. From Gene Ontology (GO) & KEGG enrichment 
      analysis, imbalance of ACE2 expression, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation, 
      and neutrophil-related processes were the main issue of COVID-19 leading kidney 
      injury. CONCLUSION: Our study provided the cellular evidence that SARS-Cov-2 invaded 
      human kidney tissue via proximal convoluted tubule, proximal tubule, proximal 
      straight tubule cells, and glomerular parietal cells by means of ACE2-related 
      pathway and used their cellular protease TMPRSS2 for priming.

TI  - Impact of building ventilation systems and habitual indoor incense burning on 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions in Middle Eastern countries.

AB  - Majority of countries across the globe have employed improving building ventilation, 
      quarantine, social distancing, and disinfections as a general measure of preventing 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus transmissions. However, arid Middle Eastern countries with hot 
      climate (elevated outdoor temperature and humidity levels) are experiencing a 
      different situation. Unfortunately, these harsh ambient climatic conditions in 
      Middle Eastern countries make it impossible for most buildings to utilize 
      natural/mechanical ventilation systems. Besides, indoor air temperatures of most 
      buildings are very low due to overconsumption of air conditioning, thereby, it can 
      be a potential factor of virus spread in most residential homes and public 
      buildings. Most importantly, habitual indoor burning of incense which is the major 
      source of coarse (PM(10); aerodynamic diameter <10Â Î¼m) and fine (PM(2.5); 
      aerodynamic diameter <2.5Â Î¼m) particulate matters (PM) could facilitate the 
      transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus droplets and particles in indoor environments. In 
      fact, it increases the spread of the virus via inhalation in these countries, 
      especially where the wearing of masks is not regulated in public, commercial and 
      residential buildings. It is therefore highly recommended for the relevant public 
      health agencies to critically assess the role of poor indoor environmental 
      conditions including the burning of incense on virus transmissions, which may help 
      to develop control measures for the future viral outbreak effectively.

AB  - It was the middle of March when we were two weeks into our clinical rotation and 
      just started to get the hang of the new hospital. When one morning after reaching 
      the hospital and finishing our patient rounds and notes, we received a frantic 
      message from our co-rotator, mentioning all clinical rotations for MD students have 
      been suspended due to COVID-19, according to the new AMA guidelines. We immediately 
      booked our flight tickets and flew back to Mumbai.

AB  - There is evidence that the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, 
      which causes COVID-19, is of animal origin. As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, 
      there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized 
      conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could 
      spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This 
      proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through 
      municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where 
      potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human 
      coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms 
      in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model 
      could apply to other parts of the globe as well.

TI  - COVID-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in 
      intensive care.
PG  - 315-324
LID - 10.1007/s10729-020-09511-7 [doi]
AB  - Managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic, where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by 
      a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time. If patients 
      are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In 
      appreciating these 'capacity-dependent' deaths, this paper reports on the 
      clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed 
      to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 
      patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early 
      stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which 
      such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives 
      involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase 
      surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that 
      total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of 
      increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and 
      flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional 
      'capacity-independent' deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available 
      within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 
      30%. The modelling tool, which is freely available and open source, has since been 
      used to support COVID-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within 
      the UK National Health Service.

AB  - COVID-19 - a novel coronavirus was firstly reported in December 2019. In response to 
      threats imposed by COVID-19, the European society for radiotherapy and oncology 
      Radiation TherapisT Committee (ESTRO RTTC) prepared this document in conjunction 
      with an infographic with four main domains: patient care, RTT workflow, remote 
      working and RT practice. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, RTTs 
      should be empowered with appropriate guidance and personal protection equipment in 
      order to provide a safe radiotherapy service by limiting potential viral exposure to 
      patients, healthcare workers and general public.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting cancellation of medical 
      student clinical rotations pose unique challenges to students' educations, the 
      impact of which has not yet been explored. DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey study 
      collected responses from 13 April 2020 until 30 April 2020. Students at US 
      allopathic medical schools completed the survey online. RESULTS: 1,668 responses 
      were analyzed. A total of 337 (20.2%) respondents thought the pandemic would affect 
      their choice of specialty, with differences across class years: 15.2% (53) of 
      first-years (MS1s), 26.4% (92) of second-years (MS2s), 23.7% (162) of third-years 
      (MS3s), and 9.7% (22) of fourth-years (MS4s) (pÂ <Â 0.0001). Among all classes, the 
      most common reason chosen was inability to explore specialties of interest (244, 
      72.4%), and the second was inability to bolster their residency application (162, 
      48.1%). Out of the MS3s who chose the latter, the majority were concerned about 
      recommendation letters (68, 81.0%) and away rotations (62, 73.8%). As high as 17.4% 
      (119) of MS3s said they were more likely to take an extra year during medical school 
      as a result of the pandemic. Region of the US, number of local COVID cases, and 
      number of local COVID deaths had no effect on whether respondents thought the 
      pandemic would affect their specialty choice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that 
      about one-fifth of surveyed medical students currently believe that the COVID-19 
      pandemic will affect their choice of specialty, with many of these citing concerns 
      that they cannot explore specialties or obtain recommendation letters. With 
      prolonged suspension of clinical rotations, targeted efforts by medical schools to 
      address these concerns through enhanced virtual curriculum development and advising 
      strategies will become increasingly important. Further study is needed to explore 
      whether these cross-sectional student perspectives will manifest as changes in 
      upcoming National Residency Matching Program data.

TI  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the adult population in 
      Bangladesh: a nationwide cross-sectional study.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has imposed threats on both physical and mental health 
      since its outbreak. This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 
      on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi 
      adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a 
      convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were 
      recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The 
      prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, 
      respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. 
      Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, 
      the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of 
      the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental 
      health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic 
      factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes. 
      These findings warrant the consideration of easily accessible low-intensity mental 
      health interventions during and beyond this pandemic.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus mostly known as COVID-19 has created a global 
      pandemic. The world is now immobilized by this infectious RNA virus. As of June 15, 
      already more than 7.9 million people have been infected and 432k people died. This 
      RNA virus has the ability to do the mutation in the human body. Accurate 
      determination of mutation rates is essential to comprehend the evolution of this 
      virus and to determine the risk of emergent infectious disease. This study explores 
      the mutation rate of the whole genomic sequence gathered from the patient's dataset 
      of different countries. The collected dataset is processed to determine the 
      nucleotide mutation and codon mutation separately. Furthermore, based on the size of 
      the dataset, the determined mutation rate is categorized for four different regions: 
      China, Australia, the United States, and the rest of the World. It has been found 
      that a huge amount of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides 
      for all regions, but codons are not frequently mutating like nucleotides. A 
      recurrent neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been applied 
      to predict the future mutation rate of this virus. The LSTM model gives Root Mean 
      Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 in testing and 0.04 in training, which is an optimized 
      value. Using this train and testing process, the nucleotide mutation rate of 400(th) 
      patient in future time has been predicted. About 0.1% increment in mutation rate is 
      found for mutating of nucleotides from T to C and G, C to G and G to T. While a 
      decrement of 0.1% is seen for mutating of T to A, and A to C. It is found that this 
      model can be used to predict day basis mutation rates if more patient data is 
      available in updated time.

AB  - We started a study on the molecular docking of six potential pharmacologically 
      active inhibitors compounds that can be used clinically against the COVID-19 virus, 
      in this case, remdesivir, ribavirin, favipiravir, galidesivir, hydroxychloroquine 
      and chloroquine interacting with the main COVID-19 protease in complex with a 
      COVID-19 N3 protease inhibitor. The highest values of affinity energy found in order 
      from highest to lowest were chloroquine (CHL), hydroxychloroquine (HYC), favipiravir 
      (FAV), galidesivir (GAL), remdesivir (REM) and ribavirin (RIB). The possible 
      formation of hydrogen bonds, associations through London forces and permanent 
      electric dipole were analyzed. The values of affinity energy obtained for the 
      hydroxychloroquine ligands was -9.9 kcal/mol and for the chloroquine of -10.8 
      kcal/mol which indicate that the coupling contributes to an effective improvement of 
      the affinity energies with the protease. Indicating that, the position chosen to 
      make the substitutions may be a pharmacophoric group, and cause changes in the 
      protease.

AB  - â¢ Two cases of Serotonin syndrome (SS) in COVID-19 patients are presented. â¢ 
      Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) have been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. â¢ 
      LPV/r with duloxetine and lithium triggered SS in patient 1. â¢ LPV/r with 
      risperidone, and probably also morphine, triggered SS in patient 2. â¢ A Video of 
      patient 2 shows myoclonus and ocular clonus in the context of SS.

AB  - A maternal woman was positive for SARS-CoV-2 tested in throat swabs but negative 
      tested in other body fluids, and she had IgG and IgA detected in breast milk. Her 
      infant negative for SARS-CoV-2 at birth had elevated IgG in serum but quickly 
      decayed. These findings suggest that breastfeeding might have the potential benefit 
      to the neonates.

AB  - The ongoing novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic makes us painfully 
      perceive that our bullet shells are blank so far for fighting against severe human 
      coronavirus (HCoV). In spite of vast research work, it is crystal clear that the 
      evident does not warrant the commercial blossoming of anti-HCoV drugs. In this 
      circumstance, drug repurposing and/or screening of databases are the only fastest 
      option. This study is an initiative to recapitulate the medicinal chemistry of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The aim is to present 
      an exquisite delineation of the current research from the perspective of a medicinal 
      chemist to allow the rapid development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents.

TI  - Analysis of the mitigation strategies for COVID-19: From mathematical modelling 
      perspective.
PG  - 109968
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109968 [doi]
AB  - In this article, a mathematical model for the transmission of COVID-19 disease is 
      formulated and analysed. It is shown that the model exhibits a backward bifurcation 
      at R0 =Â 1 when recovered individuals do not develop a permanent immunity for the 
      disease. In the absence of reinfection, it is proved that the model is without 
      backward bifurcation and the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically 
      stable for R0Â <Â 1 . By using available data, the model is validated and parameter 
      values are estimated. The sensitivity of the value of R0 to changes in any of the 
      parameter values involved in its formula is analysed. Moreover, various mitigation 
      strategies are investigated using the proposed model and it is observed that the 
      asymptomatic infectious group of individuals may play the major role in the 
      re-emergence of the disease in the future. Therefore, it is recommended that in the 
      absence of vaccination, countries need to develop capacities to detect and isolate 
      at least 30% of the asymptomatic infectious group of individuals while treating in 
      isolation at least 50% of symptomatic patients to control the disease.

TI  - COVID-19 lockdown measures reveal human impact on water transparency in the Venice 
      Lagoon.

AB  - The lagoon of Venice has always been affected by the regional geomorphological 
      evolution, anthropogenic stressors and global changes. Different morphological 
      settings and variable biogeophysical conditions characterize this continuously 
      evolving system that rapidly responds to the anthropic impacts. When the lockdown 
      measures were enforced in Italy to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection on 
      March 10th 2020, the ordinary urban water traffic around Venice, one of the major 
      pressures in the lagoon, came to a halt. This provided a unique opportunity to 
      analyse the environmental effects of restrictions to mobility on water transparency. 
      Pseudo true-colour composites Sentinel-2 satellite imagery proved useful for 
      qualitative visual interpretation, showing the reduction of the vessel traffic and 
      their wakes from the periods before and during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. A 
      quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived 
      turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural 
      processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout 
      the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a 
      transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the 
      effects of COVID-19 restrictions.

TI  - Identification of potential drug candidates to combat COVID-19: a structural study 
      using the main protease (mpro) of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19 has 
      become a global pandemic that is spreading rapidly and has caused a global health 
      emergency. Hence, there is an urgent need of the hour to discover effective drugs to 
      control the pandemic caused by this virus. Under such conditions, it would be 
      imperative to repurpose already known drugs which could be a quick and effective 
      alternative to discovering new drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-COV-2 is an 
      attractive drug target because of its essential role in the processing of the 
      majority of the non-structural proteins which are translated from viral RNA. Herein, 
      we report the high-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking studies to 
      search for the best potential inhibitors against Mpro from FDA approved drugs 
      available in the ZINC database as well as the natural compounds from the Specs 
      database. Our studies have identified six potential inhibitors of Mpro enzyme, out 
      of which four are commercially available FDA approved drugs (Cobicistat, Iopromide, 
      Cangrelor, and Fortovase) and two are from Specs database of natural compounds 
      (Hopeaphenol and Cyclosieversiodide-A). While Cobicistat and Fortovase are known as 
      HIV drugs, Iopromide is a contrast agent and Cangrelor is an anti-platelet drug. 
      Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using GROMACS were performed to 
      calculate the stability of the top-ranked compounds in the active site of Mpro. 
      After extensive computational studies, we propose that Cobicistat and Hopeaphenol 
      show potential to be excellent drugs that can form the basis of treating COVID-19 
      disease. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - A multiple sclerosis patient infected by SARS-CoV-2 during fingolimod therapy was 
      hospitalized with moderate clinical features, and recovered in 15Â days. High levels 
      of CCL5 and CCL10 chemokines and of antibody-secreting B cells were detected, while 
      the levels other B- and T-cell subsets were comparable to that of appropriate 
      controls. However, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were oligoclonally expanded and prone to 
      apoptosis when stimulated in vitro. This study suggests that 
      fingolimod-immunosuppressed patients, despite the low circulating lymphocytes, may 
      rapidly expand antibody-secreting cells and mount an effective immune response that 
      favors COVID-19 recovery after drug discontinuation.

AB  - COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 
      has many similarities with SARS-CoV. Both viruses rely on a protease called the main 
      protease, or M(pro), for replication. Therefore, inhibiting M(pro) may be a 
      successful strategy for treating COVID-19. Structures of the main proteases of 
      SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with and without inhibitor N3 are available in the Protein 
      Data Bank. Comparing these structures revealed residue interaction network changes 
      associated with N3 inhibition. Comparing network clustering with and without 
      inhibitor N3 identified the formation of a cluster of residues 17, 18, 30-33, 70, 
      95, 98, 103, 117, 122, and 177 as a network change in both viral proteases when 
      bound to inhibitor N3. Betweenness and stress centrality differences as well as 
      differences in bond energies and relative B-factors when comparing free M(pro) to 
      inhibitor-bound M(pro) identified residues 131, 175, 182, and 185 as possibly 
      conformationally relevant when bound to the inhibitor N3. Taken together, these 
      results provide insight into conformational changes of betacoronavirus M(pro)s when 
      bound to an inhibitor.

TI  - Novel Corona virus disease infection in Tunisia: Mathematical model and the impact 
      of the quarantine strategy.
PG  - 109969
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109969 [doi]
AB  - Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely serious infection with an extremely 
      high death rate worldwide. In March, the disease was declared a "global pandemic" by 
      the World Health Organization (WHO). Until now, there is no known vaccine or drug, 
      since the unknown things related to the disease are more important than our 
      theoretical and empirical knowledge. However, mathematical modeling and the 
      estimation of the basic number of reproductions can provide clarifications in order 
      to determine the potential and severity of this epidemic and therefore provide 
      essential information to identify the type of measures and interventions to be taken 
      to control the intensity of the spread of the disease. Hence, in this paper, we 
      propose a new deterministic compartmental model based on the clinical progression of 
      the disease, the epidemiological state of the individuals and the intervention for 
      the dynamics of COVID-19 infections. Our approach consists of seven phenotypes: the 
      susceptible humans, exposed humans, infectious humans, the recovered humans, the 
      quarantine population, there recovered-exposed and deceased population. We proved 
      first through mathematical approach the positivity, boundness and existence of a 
      solution to the considered model. We also studied the existence of the disease free 
      equilibrium and corresponding stability. Our work shows, in particular, that the 
      disease will decrease if the number of reproduction R (0) was less than one. 
      Moreover, the impact of the quarantine strategies to reduce the spread of this 
      disease is discussed. The theoretical results are validated by some numerical 
      simulations of the system of the epidemic's differential equations. It should be 
      mentioned that, the error between the considered model and the official data curve 
      is quite small.

TI  - Endoscope infection transmission state-of-the-art: beyond duodenoscopes to a culture 
      of infection prevention.
PG  - 366-369
LID - 10.1097/MOG.0000000000000669 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The elevator mechanism of the duodenoscope was the focus of 
      endoscopically transmitted infections prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since that 
      time, the 'suspicious suspects' in the endoscopy unit have grown in number in the 
      eyes of both patients and endoscopists. RECENT FINDINGS: This review summarizes the 
      existing guidelines related to infection control in the endoscopy unit and emerging 
      technologies to address gaps, identifies recommendations proposed during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, and reminds the reader that infection prevention has not changed 
      since the emergence of COVID-19, only the importance of infection prevention has 
      increased in visibility. SUMMARY: Infection prevention has been and will always be 
      necessary in the gastrointestinal endoscopy unit. Although outbreaks of 
      antibiotic-resistant organisms and infectious diseases like COVID-19 raise the 
      profile of infection control, there have been no major changes to infection control 
      practice recommendations because of the global pandemic. The history of lapses in 
      infection control, persistent contamination of reprocessed endoscopes, and failure 
      of many endoscopy units to identify certain endoscopic procedures as 
      aerosol-generating procedures prior to the pandemic emphasize the need for better 
      knowledge and implementation of infection control practices within endoscopy units.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 epidemic period, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
      course for international students of Medical Bachelor, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) 
      program in Zhejiang University has shifted from traditional classroom to online 
      environment. This study aimed to investigate MBBS international students' perception 
      on online TCM course, and to assess the online learning efficacy. METHODS: A total 
      of 84 MBBS international students attending course of "Basic Traditional Chinese 
      Medicine" during 2020 academic years at Zhejiang University were enrolled in this 
      study. A quantitative questionnaire was respectively completed before and after the 
      TCM course using a pretest-post-test design. By means of two online learning 
      platforms, Learning in ZJU and DingTalk, TCM course was broadcast in both live and 
      archived format to students. RESULTS: A total of 48 participants completed both 
      baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The majority of participants preferred 
      face-to-face classroom learning (26, 54.17% of total) when compared with online 
      learning. Students felt that the course had brought in much benefits (mean 3.88, SD 
      0.87), and they were satisfied with the course content (mean 3.83, SD 0.95). 
      Students' TCM related knowledge and their behaviors of discussion and consulting 
      were significantly improved by online TCM course (all PÂ <Â 0.001). Students' 
      awareness of the necessity of TCM education and their feeling of difficulty in 
      learning TCM were significantly strengthened (PÂ =Â 0.042, 0.025, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: Online learning is a good alternative for TCM course of MBBS 
      international students when classroom learning is suspended, whereas it cannot 
      replace the need for onsite and face-to-face learning.

TI  - A modular microarray imaging system for highly specific COVID-19 antibody testing.
LID - 10.1039/d0lc00547a [doi]
AB  - To detect the presence of antibodies in blood against SARS-CoV-2 in a highly 
      sensitive and specific manner, here we describe a robust, inexpensive ($200), 
      3D-printable portable imaging platform (TinyArray imager) that can be deployed 
      immediately in areas with minimal infrastructure to read coronavirus antigen 
      microarrays (CoVAMs) that contain a panel of antigens from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-1, MERS, 
      and other respiratory viruses. Application includes basic laboratories and makeshift 
      field clinics where a few drops of blood from a finger prick could be rapidly tested 
      in parallel for the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with a test turnaround time 
      of only 2-4 h. To evaluate our imaging device, we probed and imaged coronavirus 
      microarrays with COVID-19-positive and negative sera and achieved a performance on 
      par with a commercial microarray reader 100Ã more expensive than our imaging device. 
      This work will enable large scale serosurveillance, which can play an important role 
      in the months and years to come to implement efficient containment and mitigation 
      measures, as well as help develop therapeutics and vaccines to treat and prevent the 
      spread of COVID-19.

AB  - In this paper, we construct an extended SIR model with agents optimally choosing 
      outdoor activities. We calibrate the model and match it to the data from the United 
      States. The model predicts the epidemic in the United States very well. Without 
      government intervention, our simulation shows that the epidemic peaks on 22 March, 
      2020 and ends on 29 August, 2022. By the end of the epidemic, more than 21 million 
      people will be infected, and the death toll is close to 3.8 million. We further 
      conduct counterfactual experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different 
      polices against this pandemic. We find that no single policy can effectively 
      suppress the epidemic, and the most effective policy is a hybrid policy with 
      lockdown and broadening testing. Lockdown policy alone is ineffective in controlling 
      the epidemic as agents would have optimally stayed at home anyway if the infection 
      risk is high even without a lockdown. Broadening testing solely will accelerate the 
      return to normal life as there are fewer infected people hanging around. However, as 
      people do not internalize the social costs of returning to normal life, the epidemic 
      could get even worse. Increasing medical capacity without any other measures only 
      has temporary effects on reducing the death toll. We also find that random testing 
      is too inefficient unless a majority of population is infected.

      SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, high false negative rates were reported. We describe 
      here the development of a point-of-care (POC) serological assay for the detection of 
      IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2. The principle of a lateral flow immunoassay strip 
      (LFIAs) consists of fixing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to the surface of the 
      strip and coupling anti-human IgG with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). A 
      series of parameters of this method were optimized, including the concentration of 
      coating antigen, BSA blocking concentration and pH value for conjugation. The entire 
      detection process took 15-20 min with a volume of 80 Î¼L of the analyte solution 
      containing 10 Î¼L of serum and 70 Î¼L sample diluent. The performance of the 
      established assay was evaluated using serum samples of the clinically diagnosed 
      cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our results indicated that the LFIAs 
      for SARS-CoV-2 had satisfactory stability and reproducibility. As a result, our fast 
      and easy LFIAs could provide a preliminary test result for physicians to make the 
      correct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections along with alternative testing methods 
      and clinical findings, as well as seroprevalence determination, especially in 
      low-resource countries.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the delivery of medical education and has limited 
      the ability of student parents to fully engage with their studies. Student parents 
      have been faced with additional challenges such as increased childcare roles and 
      home-schooling responsibilities, splitting their focus. Identifying the issues 
      student parents face and adopting workable solutions at all levels, will ensure the 
      best outcomes for these students and better preparedness for the future.

AB  - An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus has been 
      reported worldwide and become a global health problem; hence, the diagnosis and 
      differentiation of this virus from other types of coronavirus is essential to 
      control of the disease. To this end, the analysis of genomics data plays a vital 
      role in introducing a stronger target and consequently provides better results in 
      laboratory examinations. The modified comparative genomics approach helps us to find 
      novel specific targets by comparing two or more sequences on the nucleotide 
      collection database. We, for the first time, detected ORF8 gene as a potential 
      target for the detection of the novel coronavirus. Unlike previous reported genes 
      (RdRP, E and N genes), ORF8 is entirely specific to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      and has no cross-reactivity with other kinds of coronavirus. Accordingly, ORF8 gene 
      can be used as an additional confirmatory assay.

TI  - iBioProVis: interactive visualization and analysis of compound bioactivity space.
PG  - 4227-4230
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa496 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: iBioProVis is an interactive tool for visual analysis of the compound 
      bioactivity space in the context of target proteins, drugs and drug candidate 
      compounds. iBioProVis tool takes target protein identifiers and, optionally, 
      compound SMILES as input, and uses the state-of-the-art non-linear dimensionality 
      reduction method t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to plot the 
      distribution of compounds embedded in a 2D map, based on the similarity of 
      structural properties of compounds and in the context of compounds' cognate targets. 
      Similar compounds, which are embedded to proximate points on the 2D map, may bind 
      the same or similar target proteins. Thus, iBioProVis can be used to easily observe 
      the structural distribution of one or two target proteins' known ligands on the 2D 
      compound space, and to infer new binders to the same protein, or to infer new 
      potential target(s) for a compound of interest, based on this distribution. 
      Principal component analysis (PCA) projection of the input compounds is also 
      provided, Hence the user can interactively observe the same compound or a group of 
      selected compounds which is projected by both PCA and embedded by t-SNE. iBioProVis 
      also provides detailed information about drugs and drug candidate compounds through 
      cross-references to widely used and well-known databases, in the form of linked 
      table views. Two use-case studies were demonstrated, one being on 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein which is Severe Acute Respiratory 
      Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein receptor. ACE2 binding compounds 
      and seven antiviral drugs were closely embedded in which two of them have been under 
      clinical trial for Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: iBioProVis and its carefully filtered dataset are available at 
      https://ibpv.kansil.org/ for public use. CONTACT: vatalay@metu.edu.tr. SUPPLEMENTARY 
      INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shortly after its emergence in December 2019, the coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the seventh member of the 
      Coronaviridae family of viruses that causes disease in humans. THE PROBLEM: Despite 
      the established role of molecular diagnostics, COVID-19 serodiagnosis remains a 
      poorly discovered and enigmatic area. Although there are numerous commercial 
      serological products available globally, there is a severe paucity of high-quality 
      peer-reviewed literature on their true performance characteristics. That being said, 
      publications including in-house developed serological tests started to shed light on 
      the kinetics of the humoral response. SUMMARY: In spite of intense focus of 
      assessing the performance characteristics of the commercially-available kits, the 
      main issue remains rather invisible, that is, lack of solid science behind COVID-19 
      serology its clinical usefulness thereof. This short review summarizes the key 
      points as to why COVID-19 is not jest ready to fly. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite 
      having been mentioned as a testing option, COVID-19 serology has significant 
      shortcomings that needs discussing. This short review is meant to shed light on one 
      of those aspects.

      admission in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

LID - 10.1080/23744235.2020.1784457 [doi]
AB  - Background: From January 2020, Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread 
      all over the world. An early assessment of illness severity is important for the 
      stratification of patients. We analysed the predictive value of National Early 
      Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) for intensive care unit admission (ICU) in patients with 
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome- Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.Methods: 
      Data of 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 admitted from 1 March to 20 April 2020, to the 
      Clinic of Infectious Diseases of Perugia Hospital, Italy, were retrospectively 
      reviewed. NEWS2 at hospital admission, demographic, comorbidity and clinical data 
      were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to establish the 
      correlation between each variable and ICU admission.Results: Among 68 patients 
      included in the analysis, 27 were admitted to ICU. NEWS2 at hospital admission was a 
      good predictor of ICU admission as shown by an area under the receiver-operating 
      characteristic curve analysis of 0.90 (standard error 0.04; 95% confidence interval 
      0.82-0.97). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, NEWS2 was significantly 
      related to ICU admission using thresholds of 5 and 7. No other clinical variables 
      included in the model were significantly correlated with ICU admission.A NEWS2 
      threshold of 5 had higher sensitivity than a threshold of 7 (89% and 63%). Higher 
      specificity, positive likelihood ratio and positive predictive value were found 
      using a threshold of 7 than a threshold of 5.Conclusions: NEWS2 at hospital 
      admission was a good predictor for ICU admission. Patients with severe COVID-19 were 
      correctly and rapidly stratified.

TI  - The coronavirus pandemic - A critical discussion of a tourism research agenda.
PG  - 104164
LID - 10.1016/j.tourman.2020.104164 [doi]
AB  - Unquestionable, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is one of the most impactful 
      events of the 21st century and has tremendous effects on tourism. While many tourism 
      researchers worldwide are currently 'Covid-19 research gap spotting', we call for 
      more deliberateness and rigor. While we agree that the coronavirus pandemic is 
      unique and relevant to research, we argue that not all effects are worth researching 
      or novel to us. Previous research on crises and disasters do show similar patterns 
      and existing theories can often very well explain the current phenomena. Thus, six 
      illustrative examples are shown how a research agenda could look like. This includes 
      parts where theoretical explanations from tourism are missing, as well as where we 
      think existing knowledge might be subject to a tourism paradigm-shift due to the 
      coronavirus pandemic.

TI  - Genetic counseling during COVID-19 pandemic: Tuscany experience.
PG  - e1433
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak prompted health centres to reorganize their clinical 
      and surgical activity. In this paper, we show how medical genetics department's 
      activity, in our tertiary pediatric hospital, has changed due to pandemic. METHODS: 
      We stratified all our scheduled visits, from March 9th through April 30th, and 
      assessed case-by-case which genetic consultations should be maintained as 
      face-to-face visit, or postponed/switched to telemedicine. RESULTS: Out of 288 
      scheduled appointments, 60 were prenatal consultations and 228 were postnatal 
      visits. We performed most of prenatal consultations as face-to-face visits, as women 
      would have been present in the hospital to perform other procedures in addition to 
      our consult. As for postnatal care, we suspended all outpatient first visits and 
      opted for telemedicine for selected follow-up consultations: interestingly, 75% of 
      our patients' parents revealed that they would have cancelled the appointment 
      themselves for the fear to contract an infection. CONCLUSIONS: Spread of COVID-19 in 
      Italy forced us to change our working habits. Given the necessity to optimize 
      healthcare resources and minimize the risk of in-hospital infections, we experienced 
      the benefits of telegenetics. Current pandemic made us familiar with telemedicine, 
      laying the foundations for its application to deal with the increasing number of 
      requests in clinical genetics.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted business schools worldwide mainly through the 
      shift to emergency remote teaching. I provide a rudimentary framework to understand 
      this transformation through recognizing the changes in the university, the business 
      world and the student. This disruption is going to lead to a decade-long 
      technology-led remaking of business education. Finally, I share a triphasic model 
      that maps the evolution of online learning in business schools.

TI  - Perception of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among medical professionals in Germany: 
      results from a nationwide online survey.
PG  - 1590-1599
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1785951 [doi]
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global challenge and 
      implicates a wide range of burden on medical professionals. Here, we evaluated the 
      perception of the COVID-19 pandemic among medical professionals in Germany. Methods: 
      A total of nâ=â2827 medical professionals participated in an online survey between 
      27 March and 11 April. Results: While most participants stated that Germany was well 
      prepared and rated the measures taken by their employer as positive, subgroup 
      analyses revealed decisive differences. The preventive measures were rated 
      significantly worse by nurses compared to doctors (pâ<â0.001) and by participants 
      from ambulatory healthcare centres compared to participants from maximum-care 
      hospitals (pâ<â0.001). Importantly, shortage of protective medical equipment was 
      reported more commonly in the ambulatory sector (pâ<â0.001) and in East German 
      federal states (pâ=â0.004). Moreover, the majority of health care professionals 
      (72.4%) reported significant restrictions of daily work routine. Finally, over 60% 
      of medical professionals had concerns regarding their own health, which were more 
      pronounced among female participants (pâ=â0.024). Conclusion: This survey may 
      indicate starting points on how medical professionals could be supported in carrying 
      out their important activities during the ongoing and future healthcare challenges.

AB  - â¢ Maintaining the health of clinical workforce during COVID-19 pandemic is a top 
      priority. â¢ Extraordinary measures could greatly reduce the risk of 
      cross-contamination for both staff and non-infected patients. â¢ Airway assessment is 
      a critical time for the consultant anesthetist. â¢ Projecting the airway examination 
      via a mirror can be a useful idea to minimizing viral contamination.

AB  - In this research, we are interested in predicting the epidemic peak outbreak of the 
      Coronavirus in South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. Until now, there is no known safe 
      treatment, hence the immunity system of the individual has a crucial role in 
      recovering from this contagious disease. In general, the aged individuals probably 
      have the highest rate of mortality due to COVID-19. It is well known that this 
      immunity system can be affected by the age of the individual, so it is wise to 
      consider an age-structured SEIR system to model Coronavirus transmission. For the 
      COVID-19 epidemic, the individuals in the incubation stage are capable of infecting 
      the susceptible individuals. All the mentioned points are regarded in building the 
      responsible predictive mathematical model. The investigated model allows us to 
      predict the spread of COID-19 in South Africa, Turkey, and Brazil. The epidemic peak 
      outbreak in these countries is considered, and the estimated time of the end of 
      infection is regarded by the help of some numerical simulations. Further, the 
      influence of the isolation of the infected persons on the spread of COVID-19 disease 
      is investigated.

AB  - The normal development of the pulmonary system is critical to transitioning from 
      placental-dependent fetal life to alveolar-dependent newborn life. Human lung 
      development and disease have been difficult to study due to the lack of an in vitro 
      model system containing cells from the large airways and distal alveolus. This 
      article describes a system that allows human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and 
      induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to differentiate and form three-dimensional 
      (3D) structures that emulate the development, cytoarchitecture, and function of the 
      lung ("organoids"), containing epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations, and 
      including the production of surfactant and presence of ciliated cells. The organoids 
      can also be invested with mesoderm derivatives, differentiated from the same human 
      pluripotent stem cells, such as alveolar macrophages and vasculature. Such lung 
      organoids may be used to study the impact of environmental modifiers and 
      perturbagens (toxins, microbial or viral pathogens, alterations in microbiome) or 
      the efficacy and safety of drugs, biologics, and gene transfer. Â© 2020 Wiley

AB  - OBJECTIVE: While it is well known that mental health problems are common 
      consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. 
      This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university 
      students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In total, 2501 
      home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the 
      following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the 
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), and the Patients 
      Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and 
      mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. 
      RESULTS: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also 
      reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying 
      feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially 
      mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. CONCLUSION: 
      These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify 
      and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the 
      mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future 
      longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in 
      people with mental health problems.

AB  - Online teaching for medical students is not an unusual tool used in medical 
      education. Alongside clinical placements, medical students are familiar with online 
      teaching platforms from various members of the faculty. However, the new and 
      necessary method of examining medical students from their own home during the 
      Covid-19 Pandemic is a novel approach. It is vital that medical students continue to 
      be examined, as this establishes the attainment of the curriculum learning outcomes.

      during the Covid -19 pandemic.
PG  - 374-384
LID - 10.1016/j.jobcr.2020.06.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has become a enormous 
      challenge for the health care facilitators. It has significantly affected the dental 
      professionals in their clinical practices, hospitals and even dental schools. Due to 
      the risk of cross - infection involved within in the dental setting, the dental 
      professional is even scared to provide emergent treatment for a patient. AIM: The 
      aim of this comparative review is to throw light on the essential knowledge that a 
      clinician must acquire before triaging a patient, understanding the case definition 
      of COVID-19 and preparedness required before planning to re-open the dental 
      practices. METHODOLOGY: The updated database obtained from various governmental and 
      non-governmental official webpages were rapidly analysed up till May 31, 2020. 
      CONCLUSION: This compilation of recommendations and guidance laid by various 
      authorities across the world will function as a foundation for safer dental practice 
      within the future.

TI  - Identification of promising drug candidates against NSP16 of SARS-CoV-2 through 
      computational drug repurposing study.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2020.1802349 [doi]
AB  - The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19, a 
      global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented loss of life and economy worldwide. 
      Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. 
      NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the viral 
      nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its 
      inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug 
      candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were 
      subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy 
      calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as 
      potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, 
      Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 
      (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used 
      since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms 
      from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free 
      energy of-12.83âÂ±â0.52âkcal/mol. The second best inhibitor, Galuteolin is a natural 
      compound that inhibits tyrosinase enzyme with MM-PBSA binding free energy value of 
      -11.21âÂ±â0.47âkcal/mol. Detailed ligand and protein interactions were analyzed and 
      common residues across SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV were identified. We 
      propose Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide and Galuteolin as the potential 
      inhibitors of NSP16. The results in this study can be used for the treatment of 
      COVID-19 and can also form the basis of rational drug design against NSP16 of 
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe user-centered voting systems that would support the safe 
      conduct of voting in a pandemic environment. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has 
      complicated our democratic processes. Voters and poll workers feel threatened by the 
      potential dangers of voting in business-as-usual polling stations. Indeed, 
      significant problems were encountered in the recent 2020 primary elections in 
      Wisconsin, where the National Guard had to be mobilized because so few poll workers 
      reported to work, and more than 90% of polling places had to remain closed. METHOD: 
      We describe a number of possible user-centered solutions that would help protect 
      voters and poll workers in times of pandemic, and also report the results of a 
      survey that asked voters and poll workers about what kinds of systems might make 
      them willing to vote. RESULTS: Political as well as safety considerations will need 
      to be considered as these safer voting solutions are designed since, surprisingly, 
      the kinds of solutions preferred depend on the political affiliation of the voters. 
      CONCLUSION: Human factors professionals have a large role to play in realizing the 
      safe, successful implementation of these user-centered systems. Good human factors 
      analysis can help minimize the risk to voters and poll workers. Moreover, human 
      factors methods can help safeguard democracy by creating safe and well-engineered 
      environments that are conducive to voting in the age of pandemics. APPLICATION: 
      Creating safe and effective voting solutions that protect voters and poll workers 
      during pandemic outbreaks is crucial to the preservation of democracy.

AB  - The World Health Organization recently announced that pandemic status has been 
      achieved for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Exponential increases in patient 
      numbers have been reported around the world, along with proportional increases in 
      the number of COVID-19-related deaths. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in a population 
      is expected to be influenced by social practices, availability of vaccines or 
      prophylactics, and the prevalence of susceptibility genes in the population. 
      Previous work revealed that cellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2 requires Angiotensin 
      Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and a cellular protease. The spike (S) protein on 
      SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE-2, which functions as an entry receptor. Following receptor 
      binding, transmembrane protease serine 2 (encoded by TMPRSS2) primes the S protein 
      to allow cellular uptake. Therefore, individual expression of TMPRSS2 may be a 
      crucial determinant of SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility. Here, we utilized 
      multiple large genome databases, including the GTEx portal, SNP nexus, and Ensembl 
      genome project, to identify gene expression profiles for TMPRSS2 and its important 
      expression quantitative trait loci. Our results show that four variants (rs464397, 
      rs469390, rs2070788 and rs383510) affect expression of TMPRSS2 in lung tissue. The 
      allele frequency of each variant was then assessed in regional populations, 
      including African, American, European, and three Asian cohorts (China, Japan and 
      Taiwan). Interestingly, our data shows that TMPRSS2-upregulating variants are at 
      higher frequencies in European and American populations than in the Asian 
      populations, which implies that these populations might be relatively susceptible to 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - A global emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic demands various studies related to 
      genes and genomes of the SARS-CoV2. Among other important proteins, the role of 
      accessory proteins are of immense importance in replication, regulation of 
      infections of the coronavirus in the hosts. The largest accessory protein in the 
      SARS-CoV2 genome is ORF3a which modulates the host response to the virus infection 
      and consequently it plays an important role in pathogenesis. In this study, an 
      attempt is made to decipher the conservation of nucleotides, dimers, codons and 
      amino acids in the ORF3a genes across thirty-two genomes of Indian patients. ORF3a 
      gene possesses single and double point mutations in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes 
      suggesting the change of SARS-CoV2's virulence property in Indian patients. We find 
      that the parental origin of the ORF3a gene over the genomes of SARS-CoV2 and 
      Pangolin-CoV is same from the phylogenetic analysis based on conservation of 
      nucleotides and so on. This study highlights the accumulation of mutation on ORF3a 
      in Indian SARS-CoV2 genomes which may provide the designing therapeutic approach 
      against SARS-CoV2.

TI  - Deactivation of SARS-CoV-2 with Pulsed Xenon Ultraviolet: implications for 
      environmental COVID-19 control.
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1017/ice.2020.399 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Prolonged survival of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces and personal 
      protective equipment may lead to these surfaces transmitting disease to others. This 
      article reports the effectiveness of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection system 
      in reducing the load of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and N95 respirators. METHODS: 
      Chamber slides and N95 respirator material were directly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 
      and exposed to different durations of pulsed xenon ultraviolet disinfection. 
      RESULTS: For hard surfaces, disinfection for 1, 2, and 5 minutes resulted in 3Â·53 
      Log10, >4Â·54 Log10, and >4Â·12 Log10 reductions in viral load, respectively. For N95 
      respirators, disinfection for 5 minutes resulted in >4Â·79 Log10 reduction in viral 
      load. We found that pulsed xenon ultraviolet significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 on 
      hard surfaces and N95 respirators. CONCLUSION: With the potential to rapidly 
      disinfectant environmental surfaces and N95 respirators, pulsed xenon ultraviolet 
      devices are a promising technology for the reduction of environmental and personal 
      protective equipment bioburden and to enhance both healthcare worker and patient 
      safety by reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The implementation effect of the 24-hour Supervise-Correct-Improve (SCI) supervision 
      model was investigated in COVID-19 isolation ward in putting on and taking off 
      process of personal protective equipment. As shown in results, the error rate of 
      taking off process was significantly reduced (P < 0.001) by applying the 24h "SCI" 
      mode. Staffs over 40 years old and workers were more likely to make mistakes. 
      Through uninterrupted supervision and protection, application of this mode is proved 
      to be effective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent the spread of the The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), some 
      classic public health measures are being taken, such as social distancing and 
      quarantine METHOD: Studies were identified using large-circulation international 
      journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. RESULTS: The 
      prolonged confinement is evidently related to psychological damage, considering that 
      individuals would be subjected to stressors for a longer period of time . In some 
      cases, these psychic losses lasted for many months after the end of this confinement 
      CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop and implement actions to minimize the 
      population psychological distress in meeting the needs of the communities affected 
      by COVID-19 Thus, as it occurred in China, it is necessary that the other affected 
      nations promote the publication of regulations that guide the implementation of 
      mental health services and the allocation of resources, in order to ensure that 
      individuals are monitored by competent professionals, thus reducing the 
      psychological damage that can be motivated by the social isolation period during the 
      quarantine.

AB  - Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed 
      campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented 
      closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during 
      the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. 
      Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 
      30Â days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as 
      time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater 
      increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) 
      compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater 
      perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings 
      highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that 
      will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or 
      prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.

AB  - Recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
      led to a pandemic of COVID-19. The absence of a therapeutic drug and vaccine is 
      causing severe loss of life and economy worldwide. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 employ 
      the host cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming for viral 
      entry into host cells. A potential way to reduce the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection may be to inhibit the activity of TMPRSS2. In the current study, the 
      three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 was generated by homology modelling and 
      subsequently validated with a number of parameters. The structure-based virtual 
      screening of Selleckchem database was performed through 'Virtual Work Flow' (VSW) to 
      find out potential lead-like TMPRSS2 inhibitors. Camostat and bromhexine are known 
      TMPRSS2 inhibitor drugs, hence these were used as control molecules throughout the 
      study. Based on better dock score, binding-free energy and binding interactions 
      compared to the control molecules, six molecules (Neohesperidin, Myricitrin, 
      Quercitrin, Naringin, Icariin, and Ambroxol) were found to be promising against the 
      TMPRSS2. Binding interactions analysis revealed a number of significant binding 
      interactions with binding site amino residues of TMPRSS2. The all-atoms molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulation study indicated that all proposed molecules retain inside 
      the receptor in dynamic states. The binding energy calculated from the MD simulation 
      trajectories also favour the strong affinity of the molecules towards the TMPRSS2. 
      Proposed molecules belong to the bioflavonoid class of phytochemicals and are 
      reported to possess antiviral activity, our study indicates their possible potential 
      for application in COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - Respiratory viral infections such as coronavirus (COVID-19) will cause a great 
      mortality, especially in people who underly lung diseases such as chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary and asthma. Very recently, the COVID-19 outbreak has exposed 
      the lack of quick approaches for screening people who may have risen risk of 
      pathogen contact. One proposed non-invasive potential approach to recognize the 
      viral infection is analysis of exhaled gases. It has been indicated that the nitric 
      oxide is one of most important biomarkers which might be emanated by respiratory 
      epithelial cells. Using density functional theory calculations, here, we introduced 
      a novel Au-decorated BN nanotube-based breathalyzer for probable recognition of NO 
      gas released from the respiratory epithelial cells in the presence of interfering 
      CO(2) and H(2)O gases. This breathalyzer benefits from different advantages 
      including high sensitivity (sensing responseâ¯=â¯101.5), high selectivity, 
      portability, short recovery time (1.8â¯Î¼s at 298â¯K), and low cost.

AB  - With increasing frequency, humans are facing outbreaks of emerging infectious 
      diseases (EIDs) with the potential to cause significant morbidity and mortality. In 
      the most extreme instances, such outbreaks can become pandemics, as we are now 
      witnessing with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization, this new 
      disease, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has already infected more than 
      10 million people worldwide and led to 499,913 deaths as of 29 June, 2020. How high 
      these numbers will eventually go depends on many factors, including policies on 
      travel and movement, availability of medical support, and, because there is no 
      vaccine or highly effective treatment, the pace of biomedical research. Other than 
      an approved antiviral drug that can be repurposed, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) hold 
      the most promise for providing a stopgap measure to lessen the impact of an outbreak 
      while vaccines are in development. Technical advances in mAb identification, 
      combined with the flexibility and clinical experience of mAbs in general, make them 
      ideal candidates for rapid deployment. Furthermore, the development of mAb cocktails 
      can provide a faster route to developing a robust medical intervention than 
      searching for a single, outstanding mAb. In addition, mAbs are well-suited for 
      integration into platform technologies for delivery, in which minimal components 
      need to be changed in order to be redirected against a novel pathogen. In 
      particular, utilizing the manufacturing and logistical benefits of DNA-based 
      platform technologies in order to deliver one or more antiviral mAbs has the 
      potential to revolutionize EID responses.

AB  - We model the extent to which age-targeted protective sequestration can be used to 
      reduce ICU admissions caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19. Using demographic data 
      from New Zealand, we demonstrate that lowering the age threshold to 50 years of age 
      reduces ICU admissions drastically and show that for sufficiently strict isolation 
      protocols, sequestering one-third of the countries population for a total of 8 
      months is sufficient to avoid overwhelming ICU capacity throughout the entire course 
      of the epidemic. Similar results are expected to hold for other countries, though 
      some minor adaption will be required based on local age demographics and hospital 
      facilities.

      2019 hotspots.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019, a pandemic of global concern, caused by the 
      novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Â has severely revealed the need 
      for public monitoring and efficient screening techniques. Despite the various 
      advancements made in the medical and research field, containment of this virus has 
      proven to be difficult on several levels. As such, it is a necessary requirement to 
      identify possible hotspots in the early stages of any disease. Based on previous 
      studies carried out on coronaviruses, there is a high likelihood that severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 may also survive in wastewater. Hence, we propose 
      the use of nanofiber filters as a wastewater pretreatment routine and upgradation of 
      existing wastewater evaluation and treatment systems to serve as a beneficial 
      surveillance tool.

AB  - COVID-19 has placed an increased burden on the NHS. Changes were made to expand 
      patient capacity including hospital restructuring, cancellation of most elective 
      surgeries and early graduation of final year medical students. (1) The UK foundation 
      programme (UKFP) curated a new training position for graduates as foundation interim 
      year 1 (FiY1) doctors, where they voluntarily work in paid positions prior to 
      entering formal foundation year 1 (FY1) roles. (2) Expediting the process of 
      fulfilling these positions, the General Medical Council facilitated early 
      provisional registration of doctors. We discuss the positives, pitfalls, and perils 
      of the new roles and the first impressions of three newly qualified FiY1Â s in 
      medical, obstetrics and gynaecology and surgical posts, a surgical FY1 doctor and a 
      clinical supervisor in surgery.

TI  - Systemic immunosuppression in times of COVID-19: Do we need to rethink our 
      standards?
LID - 10.1111/ddg.14194 [doi]
AB  - The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic particularly endangers older people with 
      pre-existing cardiopulmonary and metabolic conditions. However, it is also currently 
      under discussion whether patients under immunosuppressive therapy also have a higher 
      risk of suffering a severe course of the COVID-19 disease. In principle though, 
      there is currently no data available for a general reduction or pause of 
      immunosuppression in patients with autoimmune diseases because of the SARS-CoV-2 
      pandemic. However, since there is currently neither an effective therapy nor 
      corresponding vaccination protection, the indication for a prolonged 
      immunosuppressive therapy should be made with special care. In particular, 
      immunotherapeutic agents that produce long-term effects (e.g., rituximab) should be 
      used with special caution. In contrast, immunomodulating substances that do not 
      suppress antiviral immunity (e.g. systemic immunoglobulins, doxycycline), or that 
      have intrinsic effects on SARS-CoV-2 (calcineurin inhibitors, chloroquine, 
      hydroxychloroquine) may be useful alternatives.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the biggest threat to human being 
      globally. The first case was identified in a patient with flu symptoms along with 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and now it has 
      spread in more than 200 countries. COVID-19 is more lethal in the elderly and people 
      with an underlying condition such as asthma, cancer, diabetes. Here we performed 
      bioinformatic analysis to investigate the interaction of S2 subunit protein of 
      SARS-nCoV-2 of novel coronavirus with tumor suppressor proteins p53 and BRCA-1/2. In 
      this short communication we report the interaction between S2 subunit proteins with 
      tumor suppressor proteins for the first time. This preliminary result will open up a 
      new direction to investigate the effect of a novel coronavirus in cancer patients.

AB  - The objective of this report is to better understand the initial CT imaging spectrum 
      and the relationship between clinical characteristics and initial CT imaging 
      features of an imported family cluster cases involving 7 laboratory-confirmed 
      COVID-19 patients. We find that initial CT findings of 4 patients were positive 
      within one week after the onset of symptoms and 1 patient was negative before the 
      onset of symptoms. Two asymptomatic patients had typical CT abnormalities. The 
      initial CT imaging manifestations are mainly peripheral or subpleural ground-glass 
      opacities and ground-glass with consolidation. Our report is of potential guiding 
      value for the initial CT screening of imported familial cluster cases since the 
      imported cases have an identified time of infection.

TI  - Coâexpression of peripheral olfactory receptors with SARSâCoVâ2 infection mediators: 
      Potential implications beyond loss of smell as a COVIDâ19 symptom.
PG  - 949-956
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2020.4646 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirusâ2 (SARSâCoVâ2) enters into 
      human host cells via mechanisms facilitated mostly by angiotensinâconverting 
      enzymeÂ 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serineÂ 2 (TMPRSS2). New loss of smell 
      (anosmia/hyposmia) is now recognized as a COVIDâ19 related symptom, which may be 
      caused by SARSâCoVâ2 infection and damage of the olfactory receptor (OR) cells in 
      the nasal neuroâepithelium and/or central involvement of the olfactory bulb. ORs are 
      also expressed peripherally (e.g., in tissues of the gastrointestinal and 
      respiratory systems) and it is possible that their local functions could also be 
      impaired by SARSâCoVâ2 infection of these tissues. Using Gene Expression Profiling 
      Interactive Analysis, The Cancer Genome Atlas, GenotypeâTissue Expression, 
      cBioPortal and Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool, we highlight the expression 
      of peripheral ORs in both healthy and malignant tissues, and describe their 
      coâexpression with key mediators of SARSâCoVâ2 infection, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, 
      asÂ wellÂ as cathepsinÂ L (CTSL; another cellular protease mediating SARSâCoVâ2 
      infection of host cells). A wide expression profile of peripheral ORs was noted, 
      particularly in tissues such as the prostate, testis, thyroid, brain, liver, kidney 
      and bladder, asÂ wellÂ as tissues with known involvement in cardioâmetabolic disease 
      (e.g., the adipose tissue, pancreas and heart). Among these, OR51E2, in particular, 
      was significantly upregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and coâexpressed 
      primarily with TMPRSS2. Functional networks of this OR were further analysed using 
      the GeneMANIA interactive tool, showing that OR51E2 interacts with a plethora of 
      genes related to the prostate. Further inÂ vitro and clinical studies are clearly 
      required to elucidate the role of ORs, both at the olfactory level and the 
      periphery, in the context of COVIDâ19.

AB  - In this article, we develop a mathematical model considering susceptible, exposed, 
      infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation and recovered classes as in case of 
      COVID-19 disease. The facility of quarantine/isolation have been provided to both 
      exposed and infected classes. Asymptotic individuals either recovered without 
      undergo treatment or moved to infected class after some duration. We have formulated 
      the reproduction number for the proposed model. Elasticity and sensitivity analysis 
      indicates that model is more sensitive towards the transmission rate from exposed to 
      infected classes rather than transmission rate from susceptible to exposed class. 
      Analysis of global stability for the proposed model is studied through Lyapunov's 
      function.

AB  - A new pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
      spread worldwide and become pandemic with thousands new deaths and infected cases 
      globally. To treat the patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), currently no 
      effective drug or vaccine is available. This necessity motivated us to explore 
      potential lead compounds based natural products targeting main protease (M(pro)) 
      enzyme of SARS-CoV-2. The M(pro) enzyme plays a key role in mediating viral 
      replication and transcription and thus being considered as an attractive drug 
      target. Herein, comprehensive computational investigations were performed to 
      identify new lead compounds against main protease enzyme. In this study, the 
      candidate anthocyanin-derived compounds from PubChem database were filtered 
      considering antiviral characteristics of anthocyanins. The structure-based 
      pharmacophore modeling was developed based on the co-crystallized structure of the 
      enzyme with its biological active inhibitor. The generated hypotheses were applied 
      for virtual screening-based PHASE Screen Score. Docking based virtual screening work 
      flow was used to generate hit compounds using HTVS, SP and XP based Glide Gscore. 
      The obtained hit compounds were filtered using ADMET pharmacological and 
      physicochemical properties screening. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed 
      to explore the binding affinities of the considered compounds. Our study identified 
      six best anthocyanin-derived natural compounds which could be used as promising lead 
      compounds against main protease SARS-CoV-2 virus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

TI  - Role for antimalarials in the management of COVID-19.
PG  - 449-457
LID - 10.1097/BOR.0000000000000731 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The current review highlights recent insights into direct 
      antiviral effects by antimalarials against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      (SARS)-CoV-2 and other viruses and their potential indirect effects on the host by 
      avoiding exaggerated immune responses (reduced cytokine release, Toll-like receptor 
      response, antigen presentation related to lysosomal processing). RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Currently, there is a large debate on the use of antimalarials for prophylaxis and 
      treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease based on preclinical in-vitro data, small 
      case series and extrapolation from earlier studies of their effect on intracellular 
      pathogens, including many viruses. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or chloroquine have not 
      demonstrated robust efficacy in prior randomized controlled studies against several 
      other viruses. In-vitro data indicate a reduced viral replication of SARS-CoV-2. 
      Especially immunomodulatory effects of antimalarials might also contribute to a 
      clinical efficacy. For SARS-CoV-2 various large studies will provide answers as to 
      whether antimalarials have a place in prophylaxis or treatment of the acute virus 
      infection with SARS-CoV-2 but compelling data are missing so far. SUMMARY: In-vitro 
      data provide a theoretical framework for an efficacy of antimalarials in 
      SARS-CoV-2-induced disease but clinical proof is currently missing.

AB  - Three hundred and ninety-seven primary- and secondary-care physicians were tested 
      for the presence of IgG (and IgA) antibodies against SARS-coronavirus-2 with a 
      commercially available ELISA. In 19 of 20 individuals with PCR-proven infection and 
      only mild to moderate symptoms not requiring hospitalization positive IgG levels 
      occurred within two to three weeks. Among the remaining 377 persons without 
      clear-cut evidence of infection, unequivocally positive IgG antibodies were found in 
      only one, showing a surprisingly low prevalence (0.3%, 95% CI: 0.01-1.5) in 
      physicians with likely contacts with infected patients in a region highly affected 
      by the pandemic (Tyrol, Austria).

AB  - The unprecedented pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) is threatening global health. The virus emerged in late 2019 and can 
      cause a severe disease associated with significant mortality. Several vaccine 
      development and drug discovery campaigns are underway. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease 
      is considered a promising drug target, as it is dissimilar to human proteases. 
      Sequence and structure of the main protease are closely related to those from other 
      betacoronaviruses, facilitating drug discovery attempts based on previous lead 
      compounds. Covalently binding peptidomimetics and small molecules are investigated. 
      Various compounds show antiviral activity in infected human cells.

PG  - 590-607

AB  - In this paper, we apply optimal control theory to a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
      transmission model given by a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations. 
      Optimal control strategies are obtained by minimizing the number of exposed and 
      infected population considering the cost of implementation. The existence of optimal 
      controls and characterization is established using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. 
      An expression for the basic reproduction number is derived in terms of control 
      variables. Then the sensitivity of basic reproduction number with respect to model 
      parameters is also analysed. Numerical simulation results demonstrated good 
      agreement with our analytical results. Finally, the findings of this study shows 
      that comprehensive impacts of prevention, intensive medical care and surface 
      disinfection strategies outperform in reducing the disease epidemic with optimum 
      implementation cost.

AB  - The spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections worldwide has 
      raised concerns about the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2. Devices that rapidly 
      inactivate viruses can reduce the chance of infection through aerosols and contact 
      transmission. This in vitro study demonstrated that irradiation with a deep 
      ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) of 280âÂ±â5ânm wavelength rapidly 
      inactivates SARS-CoV-2 obtained from a COVID-19 patient. Development of devices 
      equipped with DUV-LED is expected to prevent virus invasion through the air and 
      after touching contaminated objects.

AB  - The spreading of new viruses is known to provoke global human health threat. The 
      current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is 
      one significant and unfortunate example of what the world will have to face in the 
      future with emerging viruses in absence of appropriate treatment. The discovery of 
      potent and specific antiviral inhibitors and/or vaccines to fight these massive 
      outbreaks is an urgent research priority. Enzymes involved in the capping pathway of 
      viruses and more specifically RNA N7- or 2'O-methyltransferases (MTases) are now 
      admitted as potential targets for antiviral chemotherapy. We designed bisubstrate 
      inhibitors by mimicking the transition state of the 2'-O-methylation of the cap RNA 
      in order to block viral 2'-O MTases. This work resulted in the synthesis of 16 
      adenine dinucleosides with both adenosines connected by various nitrogen-containing 
      linkers. Unexpectedly, all the bisubstrate compounds were barely active against 2'-O 
      MTases of several flaviviruses or SARS-CoV but surprisingly, seven of them showed 
      efficient and specific inhibition against SARS-CoV N7-MTase (nsp14) in the 
      micromolar to submicromolar range. The most active nsp14 inhibitor identified is as 
      potent as but particularly more specific than the broad-spectrum MTase inhibitor, 
      sinefungin. Molecular docking suggests that the inhibitor binds to a pocket formed 
      by the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and cap RNA binding sites, conserved among

TI  - The constitutional economics of the World Health Organization.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1017/S1744133120000249 [doi]
AB  - This paper brings a constitutional economics perspective to bear on the World Health 
      Organization (WHO), the flagship United Nations intergovernmental health 
      organisation, which is obligated by its Constitution to achieve 'the highest 
      possible level of health' for the world's peoples. The WHO has in the seven decades 
      of its existence used its formidable legislative powers only sparingly. It has been 
      widely chided for being weak in regional coordination and unresponsive to 
      transnational emergencies like the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. In 
      2020, it found itself at the centre of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the middle of 
      the Sino-American geopolitical tug-of-war. This paper traces the discordance between 
      the Constitution's stated purposes and the actual track record of the WHO not back 
      to its organisational culture nor to weak leadership but to the design of the 
      Constitution itself. It analytically distinguishes the Constitution's expressive 
      from its instrumental halves, and shows that, whilst the former embodies a 
      'constitutional moment' of international health solidarity right after the Second 
      World War, the latter embodies a reserved and limited delegation from member-states 
      that are jealous of their sovereignty.

      China.
PG  - 2583-2587
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2020.11329 [doi]
AB  - Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases associated with the 2019 novel 
      coronavirus (2019ânCoV) have emerged in Wuhan, China, which has resulted in a rapid 
      outbreak in China and worldwide. The present study aimed to describe the clinical, 
      laboratory and radiological characteristics of 2019ânCoV pneumonia (NCP) in Zhejiang 
      province, outside of Wuhan. A total of 74Â patients with 2019ânCoV were continuously 
      enrolled between January 22 and March 2, 2020 at Zhejiang Hospital. Diagnosis was 
      confirmed at Zhejiang Hospital by reverse transcriptionâPCR (RTâPCR), which was 
      approved by the Chinese government. Subsequently, the clinical features between 
      positiveâ and negativeâNCP patients in Zhejiang were compared. Among the 
      74Â hospitalized patients with suspected 2019âNCP, six patients (one male and five 
      female patients) were confirmed to be infected with 2019ânCoV by RTâPCR. The average 
      age of the confirmed patients was 40Â±13Â years. There were three family clusters 
      among the confirmed cases, one patient from each of these families had travel 
      history or contact with patients from Wuhan within 2Â weeks. Compared with nonâNCP 
      patients, the most common symptoms at onset for patients with NCP were fever (5/6; 
      83.3%) and cough (5/6; 83.3%), followed by dyspnea/pharyngalgia (2/6; 33.3%), 
      whereas myalgia (1/6; 16.7%) and fatigue (1/6; 16.7%) were less common. All 
      74Â patients with suspected NCP exhibited abnormal computerized tomography (CT) 
      images. In total, 2/6 (33.3%) patients with confirmed NCP presented with bilateral 
      pneumonia, and 21/68 (30.9%) nonâNCP patients exhibited bilateral pneumonia, with 
      bilateral distribution of patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. The present study 
      revealed that epidemiological history was critical to the diagnosis of 2019ânCoV in 
      low epidemic regions outside Hubei province. It was also identified that chest CT 
      could not replace nucleic acid testing due to similar radiological manifestations.

AB  - Reverse transcriptionâquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTâqPCR) is the gold 
      standard method for the diagnosis of COVIDâ19 infection. Due to preâanalytical and 
      technical limitations, samples with low viral load are often misdiagnosed as 
      falseânegative samples. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other strategies able 
      to overcome the limits of RTâqPCR. Blinded swab samples from two individuals 
      diagnosed positive and negative for COVIDâ19 were analyzed by droplet digital PCR 
      (ddPCR) and RTâqPCR in order to assess the sensitivity of both methods. 
      Intercalation chemistries and a World Health Organization (WHO)/Center for Disease 
      Control and Prevention (CDC)âapproved probe for the SARSâCoVâ2 N gene were used. 
      SYBRâGreen RTâqPCR is not able to diagnose as positive samples with low viral load, 
      while, TaqMan Probe RTâqPCR gave positive signals at very late Ct values. On the 
      contrary, ddPCR showed higher sensitivity rate compared to RTâqPCR and both EvaGreen 
      and probe ddPCR were able to recognize the sample with low viral load as positive 
      even at 10âfold diluted concentration. In conclusion, ddPCR shows higher sensitivity 
      and specificity compared to RTâqPCR for the diagnosis of COVIDâ19 infection in 
      falseânegative samples with low viral load. Therefore, ddPCR is strongly recommended 
      in clinical practice for the diagnosis of COVIDâ19 and the followâup of positive 
      patients until complete remission.

AB  - This paper studies the differences in stock market reactions to the same kind of 
      disease-related news by analyzing abnormal returns of global stock markets during 
      Public Health Risk Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) announcements. Drawing 
      the data from 26 stock market indices over the period from 22 April 2008 to 12 March 
      2020, we compare stock market reactions to all six PHEIC announcements made by the 
      World Health Organization since 2009. Although the PHEIC announcements can be 
      categorized as the same type of event, we found no consistent patterns in market 
      reactions. The markets did not show significant reactions in a 30-day event window, 
      which suggests a relatively low economic impact of the diseases on a global scale 
      during this time, except for Covid-19. Among all diseases included in our study, 
      only Covid-19 had a significant negative effect on stock markets at least lasting 30 
      days.

AB  - Recent advances in virus-like nanoparticles against Middle East respiratory 
      syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can initiate vaccine production faster for 
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while ensuring the 
      safety, easy administration, and long-term effects. Patients with this viral 
      pathogen suffer from excess mortality. MERS-CoV can spread through bioaerosol 
      transmission from animal or human sources. The appearance of an outbreak in South 
      Korea sparked off a strong urge to design strategies for developing an effective 
      vaccine since the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012. Well unfortunately, this is an 
      important fact in virus risk management. The studies showed that virus-like 
      nanoparticles (VLPs) could be effective in its goal of stopping the symptoms of 
      MERS-CoV infection. Besides, due to the genetic similarities in the DNA sequencing 
      of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and the first identified severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome (SARS-CoV) in China since 2002/2003, strategic approaches could be used to 
      manage SARS-CoV 2. Gathering the vital piece of information obtained so far could 
      lead to a breakthrough in the development of an effective vaccine against 
      SARS-CoV-2, which is prioritized and focussed by the World Health Organization 
      (WHO). This review focuses on the virus-like nanoparticle that got successful 
      results in animal models of MERS-CoV.

AB  - The highest risk of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to be spread through human-to-human 
      transmission has boosted the use of personal protective equipment at worldwide 
      level. In Europe, the medical face masks must be tested to certify the essential 
      requirements in agreement with European Standard EN 14683:2019, and face masks for 
      industrial use in agreement with European Standard EN 149:2009. Due to the need of 
      large quantitative of medical and non-medical face masks in coronavirus outbreak, 
      several Italian industries are working for shift a portion of their manufacturing 
      capacity for producing medical and non-medical face mask. For screening evaluation 
      of the effectiveness of personal protective equipment produced by reconverted 
      industries, ARPA Lazio and the Department of Chemical Science and Technologies of 
      Tor Vergata University have set-up an analytical system able to simulate the 
      respiratory action and to measure the percentage of particles that pass through the 
      face masks using optical particle counter (based on the EN 16890: 2017 that uses the 
      same light scattering principle to evaluate the filter filtration efficiency). This 
      set-up was challenged using face masks produced by reconverted industries and the 
      data were compared with ones obtained using medical face mask.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which 
      originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in late December 2019, is the cause of 
      ongoing pandemic. We analyzed the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2, a classification of the 
      Chinese medicine dialectic and treatment regimen, and promptly enacted the 
      recommendation of Korean medicine preparations in herbal medicine covered under 
      domestic medical insurance benefits depending on the circumstances in our country. 
      METHOD: The clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was 
      developed based on consensus from a group of experts. RESULTS: Two kinds of herbal 
      medicines (HM) were recommended for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2; Youngyopaedoc-san 
      plus Bojungikgitang, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus Saengmaek-san. Two herbal 
      preparations were recommended for people with a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; 
      Youngyopaedoc-san plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san, and Youngyopaedoc-san plus 
      Bojungikgi-tang. Three herbal preparations were recommended for mildly symptomatic 
      COVID-19 patients; Youngyopaedoc-san plus Galgunhaegui-tang was recommended for 
      those without pneumonia with wind-warmth disease invading the lungs; Sosiho-tang 
      plus Bulhwangeumjeonggi-san was recommended for those with dampness-heat disease in 
      the lungs. For the recovery stage, Samchulkunbi-tang plus Saengmaek-san, or 
      Samchulkunbi-tang plus Chungseuiki-tang was recommended. CONCLUSION: The CPG was 
      developed to guide the use of Korean herbal medicine in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, 
      and it is expected that this will be the basis for providing proper treatment of 
      similar infectious diseases in the future.

AB  - How severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections engage 
      cellular host pathways and innate immunity in infected cells remains largely 
      elusive. We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in SARS-CoV-2 
      infected Huh7 cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We 
      identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that 
      were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. 
      Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways 
      revealed a dose-dependent activation of Akt, mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 24 hours post 
      infection (hpi). However, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1Î± through 24hpi 
      and 48hpi of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the 
      Akt/mTOR/HIF-1 signaling pathways. Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway using 
      Akt inhibitor MK-2206 showed a significant reduction in virus production. Further 
      investigations are required to better understand the molecular sequelae in order to 
      guide potential therapy in the management of severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) patients.

      Epidemic.
LID - 10.1002/ppul.25000 [doi]
AB  - With the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection outbreak and spread, serious cases 
      of infection and neonatal infection have been reported. Moreover, children show 
      milder cases and a better prognosis than adults. The outpatient Department of 
      Paediatrics has played a crucial role in the prevention and control of novel 
      coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection in children. Based on previous experience and 
      existing diagnosis and treatment guidelines, we present the relevant strategies of 
      this particular paediatric outpatient department when responding to the epidemic. 
      Conclusion: Concurrently, we hope that this article can act as a reference in the 
      fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further modifications will be made in the future 
      with the increase in clinical experience and changes in the disease. This article is

TI  - Measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity using pseudotyped and chimeric 
      viruses.
LID - 10.1084/jem.20201181 [doi]
LID - e20201181
AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the ensuing explosive epidemic of COVID-19 disease 
      has generated a need for assays to rapidly and conveniently measure the antiviral 
      activity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a collection of 
      approaches based on SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped, single-cycle, 
      replication-defective human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), and vesicular 
      stomatitis virus (VSV), as well as a replication-competent VSV/SARS-CoV-2 chimeric 
      virus. While each surrogate virus exhibited subtle differences in the sensitivity 
      with which neutralizing activity was detected, the neutralizing activity of both 
      convalescent plasma and human monoclonal antibodies measured using each virus 
      correlated quantitatively with neutralizing activity measured using an authentic 
      SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. The assays described herein are adaptable to high 
      throughput and are useful tools in the evaluation of serologic immunity conferred by 
      vaccination or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the potency of convalescent 
      plasma or human monoclonal antibodies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe infection by SARS-CoV-2 has shown to entail an increased risk 
      of thrombotic, especially venous, events. Central venous catheters have also been 
      associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism 
      as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly 
      prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old 
      woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated 
      with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive 
      care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis 
      highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of 
      contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper 
      extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic 
      tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the 
      subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with 
      direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until 
      removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on 
      discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Paradoxical embolism due to intra- or extra-cardiac shunt 
      should be considered in patients with COVID-19, given the high associated risk of 
      venous thromboembolism. Further studies are needed to be able to define optimal 
      prophylactic and therapeutic management.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in 
      a pandemic and is continuing to spread rapidly around the globe. No effective 
      vaccine is currently available to prevent COVID-19, and intense efforts are being 
      invested worldwide into vaccine development. In this context, all technology 
      platforms must overcome several challenges resulting from the use of an incompletely 
      characterized new virus. These include finding the right conditions for virus 
      amplification for the development of vaccines based on inactivated or attenuated 
      whole viral particles. Here, we describe a shotgun tandem mass spectrometry 
      workflow, the data produced can be used to guide optimization of the conditions for 
      viral amplification. In parallel, we analysed the changes occurring in the host cell 
      proteome following SARS-CoV-2 infection to glean information on the biological 
      processes modulated by the virus that could be further explored as potential drug 
      targets to deal with the pandemic.

TI  - TMPRSS2 and furin are both essential for proteolytic activation of SARS-CoV-2 in 
      human airway cells.
LID - e202000786 [pii]
LID - 10.26508/lsa.202000786 [doi]
AB  - The novel emerged SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the world causing acute 
      infection of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) that can result in severe disease and 
      lethality. For SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, its surface glycoprotein spike (S) must be 
      cleaved at two different sites by host cell proteases, which therefore represent 
      potential drug targets. In the present study, we show that S can be cleaved by the 
      proprotein convertase furin at the S1/S2 site and the transmembrane serine protease 
      2 (TMPRSS2) at the S2' site. We demonstrate that TMPRSS2 is essential for activation 
      of SARS-CoV-2 S in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells through antisense-mediated 
      knockdown of TMPRSS2 expression. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 replication was also 
      strongly inhibited by the synthetic furin inhibitor MI-1851 in human airway cells. 
      In contrast, inhibition of endosomal cathepsins by E64d did not affect virus 
      replication. Combining various TMPRSS2 inhibitors with furin inhibitor MI-1851 
      produced more potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 than an equimolar amount 
      of any single serine protease inhibitor. Therefore, this approach has considerable 
      therapeutic potential for treatment of COVID-19.

AB  - This survey aimed to assess the concerns of students of health-related higher 
      education in Brazil regarding distance learning during the coronavirus pandemic. A 
      Google Forms anonymous questionnaire was sent by WhatsApp Messenger to students at a 
      private university. Seven hundred and four students answered the questionnaire (566 
      female, 138 male, mean age = 23.09 years), reflecting approximately a third of the 
      students in health-related disciplines. Students reported feeling anxious due to the 
      pandemic. Most of the students agreed with having the ability to continue education 
      through distance learning, but relatively few of them enjoyed it. Also, students 
      were concerned that learning of clinical material and professional training would be 
      impaired, and they were afraid of failing the year of education. Health-related 
      higher education private institutions in Brazil should focus on reassessing and 
      prioritizing their policies and protocols and include a detailed plan for the 
      future.

TI  - Long-term effects of COVID-19 in a patient on maintenance dialysis.
LID - 10.1111/hdi.12859 [doi]
AB  - Coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory infection highly 
      associated with severe complications in elderly subjects affected by cardiovascular 
      disease. Patients on maintenance dialysis are exceptionally vulnerable because most 
      of them are old and have multiple comorbidities. We report the complex clinical 
      course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient on maintenance dialysis who presented 
      with fever and lung edema. After 41âdays from the primary infection, the clinically 
      recovered patient experienced symptomatic reactivation of SARS-COV-2 infection 
      documented by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result on nasal/oropharyngeal 
      swab with immunoglobulin M seroconversion. The recurrence of PCR positivity forced 
      us to perform hemodialysis in a separate isolation room for a prolonged period of 
      time. Close monitoring of previously infected patients and restructuring of dialysis 
      facilities are necessary to avoid new outbreaks of this concerning disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with severe 
      pulmonary and cardiovascular complications. CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes 
      a young patient with COVID-19 without any comorbidity presenting with severe 
      cardiovascular complications, manifesting with pulmonary embolism, embolic stroke, 
      and right heart failure. CONCLUSION: Management with short-term mechanical 
      circulatory support, including different cannulation strategies, resulted in a 
      successful outcome despite his critical cardiovascular status.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become one of the most challenging 
      episodes in the history of modern public health, with particular emphasis in high 
      risk population. However, the evidence regarding their response to the Severe Acute 
      Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), the agent responsible for COVID-19 
      is scant (2) . Herein we present the clinical and therapeutic course of a SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in a patient with multivisceral transplant and a recent tuberculosis 
      infection.

LID - e202006005 [pii]
LID - 10.1083/jcb.202006005 [doi]
AB  - Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 must (1) enter a target/host cell, (2) 
      reprogram it to ensure its replication, (3) exit the host cell, and (4) repeat this 
      cycle for exponential growth. During the exit step, the virus hijacks the 
      sophisticated machineries that host cells employ to correctly fold, assemble, and 
      transport proteins along the exocytic pathway. Therefore, secretory pathway-mediated 
      assemblage and excretion of infective particles represent appealing targets to 
      reduce the efficacy of virus biogenesis, if not to block it completely. Here, we 
      analyze and discuss the contribution of the molecular machines operating in the 
      early secretory pathway in the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and their relevance for 
      potential antiviral targeting. The fact that these molecular machines are conserved 
      throughout evolution, together with the redundancy and tissue specificity of their 
      components, provides opportunities in the search for unique proteins essential for 
      SARS-CoV-2 biology that could also be targeted with therapeutic objectives. Finally, 
      we provide an overview of recent evidence implicating proteins of the early 
      secretory pathway as potential antiviral targets with effective therapeutic 
      applications.

AB  - Healthcare employees were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among 734 
      employees, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 1.6%. Employees with heavy 
      COVID-19 exposure had similar antibody prevalence as those with limited or no

      nucleocapsid protein.

AB  - The nucleocapsid protein is significant in the formation of viral RNA of the severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), accounting for the largest 
      proportion of viral structural proteins. Here, we report for the first time that the 
      11S proteasomal activator PA28Î³ regulates the intracellular abundance of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 N protein (nCoV N). Furthermore, we have identified proteasome activator 
      PA28Î³ as a nCoV N binding protein by co-immunoprecipitation assay. As a result of 
      their interaction, nCoV N could be degraded by PA28Î³-20S inÂ vitro degradation assay. 
      This was also demonstrated by blocking de novo protein synthesis with cycloheximide. 
      The stability of nCoV N in PA28Î³-knockout cells was greater than in PA28Î³-wildtype 
      cells. Notably, immunofluorescence staining revealed that knockout of the PA28Î³ gene 
      in cells led to the transport of nCoV N from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 
      Overexpression of PA28Î³ enhanced proteolysis of nCoV N compared to that in 
      PA28Î³-N151Y cells containing a dominant-negative PA28Î³ mutation, which reduced this 
      process. These results suggest that PA28Î³ binding is important in regulating 20S 
      proteasome activity, which in turn regulates levels of the critical nCoV N 
      nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2, furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis 
      of COVID-19.

AB  - In the case of a new viral disease outbreak, an immediate development of virus 
      detection kits and vaccines is required. For COVID-19, we established a rapid 
      production procedure for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) by using the 
      baculovirus-silkworm expression system. The baculovirus vector-derived S proteins 
      were successfully secreted to silkworm serum, whereas those formed insoluble 
      structure in the larval fat body and the pupal cells. The ectodomain of S protein 
      with the native sequence was cleaved by the host furin-protease, resulting in less 
      recombinant protein production. The S protein modified in furin protease-target site 
      was efficiently secreted to silkworm serum and was purified as oligomers, which 
      showed immunoreactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S2 antibody. By using the direct 
      transfection of recombinant bacmid to silkworms, we achieved the efficient 
      production of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as fetal bovine serum (FBS)-free system. The 
      resultant purified S protein would be useful tools for the development of 
      immunodetection kits, antigen for immunization for immunoglobulin production, and 
      vaccines.

AB  - Currently, testing for coronavirus is performed with time and personnel consuming 
      PCR assays. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and 
      capacity of a fully automated, random access high-throughput real-time PCR-based 
      diagnostic platform for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The NeuMoDx N96 system 
      displayed an equal or better detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 compared with the 
      LightCycler 480II system and showed a specificity of 100%. The median PCR run time 
      for all 28 PCR runs was 91 (IQR 84-97) minutes. The capacity of the NeuMoDx N96 
      could easily surpass the capacity of most currently used molecular test systems and 
      significantly reduce the turn-around time.

PG  - 735-739
LID - 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000808 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the plethora of publications discussing the severe 
      respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evidence of viral secretion in urine is 
      sparse. RECENT FINDINGS: We could identify 34 publications including a total of 2172 
      patients. Among those, 549 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, 
      which was detected in only 38 patients (6.9%). Within the seven studies displaying 
      positive results, the majority of positive patients (86.8%) was from not yet 
      peer-reviewed studies including weak data and heterogeneous techniques for sample 
      testing. Furthermore, none of the studies available in the literature addressed the 
      virulence of detected viral RNA in urine. SUMMARY: Overall, only seven studies were 
      able to detect SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, all of them with a considerably low 
      rate of positivity. However, these studies were of rather low quality considering 
      their methodology. Despite this, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine, it is of 
      importance to discuss safety and urinary hygiene protocols. Until further research 
      provides valid data on viral shedding and virulence in urine, potential risk of 
      transmission through urine cannot be ruled out. Therefore, safety and hygiene 
      measures need to be discussed.

      both acquiring and transmitting infection, all healthcare facilities must rapidly 
      and rigorously implement the full hierarchy of established infection controls: 
      source control (removal or mitigation of infection sources), engineering and

TI  - Lombardy regional urgent reorganization for congenital cardiac patients following 
      the Covid-19 pandemic.
PG  - 654-659
LID - 10.2459/JCM.0000000000001055 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: By the end of February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic infection had spread 
      in Northern Italy, with thousands of patients infected. In Lombardy, the most 
      affected area, the majority of public and private hospitals were dedicated to caring 
      for COVID-19 patients and were organized following the 'Hub-and-Spoke' model for 
      other medical specialties, like cardiac surgery and interventional procedures for 
      congenital cardiac disease (CHD). Here, we report how the congenital cardiac care 
      system was modified in Lombardy and the first results of this organization. METHODS: 
      We describe a modified 'Hub-and-Spoke' model - that involves 59 birthplaces and 
      three specialized Congenital Cardiac Centers -- and how the hub center organized his 
      activity. We also reported the data of the consecutive cases hospitalized during 
      this period. RESULTS: From 9 March to 15 April, we performed: a total of 21 cardiac 
      surgeries, 4 diagnostic catheterizations, 3 CT scans, and 2 CMR. In three cases with 
      prenatal diagnosis, the birth was scheduled. The spoke centers referred to our 
      center six congenital cardiac cases. The postop ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation 
      support was required in two cases; one case died. None of these patients nor their 
      parents or accompanying person was found to be COVID-19-positive; 2 pediatric 
      intensivists were found to be COVID-19-positive, and needed hospitalization without 
      mechanical ventilation; 13 nurses had positive COVID swabs (4 with symptoms), and 
      were managed and isolated at home. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggest that the 
      model adopted met the immediate needs with a good outcome without increased 
      mortality, nor COVID-19 exposure for the patients who underwent procedures.

TI  - Strengthening health care research and academics during and after COVID19 pandemic- 
      an Indian perspective.
PG  - 343-346
LID - 10.1016/j.jobcr.2020.06.015 [doi]
AB  - The world-wide crisis of COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily lives, global 
      economies, intra/inter-countries political outlook and educational systems. Schools 
      and colleges in India and abroad are under lock-down to maximize social distancing 
      and minimize the spread of infection amongst students and teaching staff. Health 
      sciences related universities and researchers are forced to adopt non-contact 
      teaching and research. Present article highlights the positive impact and 
      opportunities provided by COVID-19 crisis to health care research and academic 
      set-up. We have compiled ethical, effective and practical guidelines to mitigate the 
      impact on health care related research and academic front during these pandemic 
      times in an Indian perspective. These guidelines and management suggestions can be 
      modified to suit region based cases and can be applied in global perspective also. 
      The suggestions in the current article provide a working collaboration of students 
      and teachers to effectively connect on virtual platforms to strengthen their 
      research output, giving suggestions of data-sharing and rapid review of proposals by 
      online review ethical boards. This time is proposed to be used for generating a 
      positive impact on health and research sector to use each adversity as an 
      opportunity.

AB  - Since its first appearance in December 2019 in the Chinese province of Wuhan, 
      COVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world and poses a serious threat to 
      public health. Acute respiratory failure due to widespread lung inflammation 
      progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an altered pulmonary and 
      alveolar function that can lead to disability, prolong hospitalizations, and adverse 
      outcomes. While there is no specific treatment for severe acute lung injury (ALI) 
      and ARDS due to the COVID-19 and the management is mostly supportive, it is very 
      important to better understand the pathophysiological processes activated by the 
      inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and metalloproteinases with the aim of 
      their subsequent inhibition in the course of the complex treatment. Herein, we will 
      discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALI/ARDS, with a focus on the pivotal 
      role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the kinin-kallikrein system 
      (KKS), and the effects of the possible pharmacological interventions. Aprotinin is a 
      nonspecific protease inhibitor especially of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and 
      kallikrein, and it is many years in clinical use. Aprotinin inhibits the release of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines and involved in the process of glycoprotein homeostasis. 
      Experimental data support that the use of aprotinin to inhibit MMPs and KKS may be a 
      new potential approach to the treatment of ALI / ARDS.

AB  - In this study, confirmed COVID-19 cases of Denmark, Belgium, Germany, France, United 
      Kingdom, Finland, Switzerland and Turkey were modeled with Auto-Regressive 
      Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Nonlinear Autoregression Neural Network (NARNN) 
      and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) approaches. Six model performance metric were used 
      to select the most accurate model (MSE, PSNR, RMSE, NRMSE, MAPE and SMAPE). 
      According to the results of the first step of the study, LSTM was found the most 
      accurate model. In the second stage of the study, LSTM model was provided to make 
      predictions in a 14-day perspective that is yet to be known. Results of the second 
      step of the study shows that the total cumulative case increase rate is expected to 
      decrease slightly in many countries.

TI  - Clinical Course and Outcomes of 3,060 Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in 
      Korea, January-May 2020.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The fatality rate of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
      varies among countries owing to demographics, patient comorbidities, surge capacity 
      of healthcare systems, and the quality of medical care. We assessed the clinical 
      outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Korea. 
      METHODS: Using a modified World Health Organization clinical record form, we 
      obtained clinical data for 3,060 patients with COVID-19 treated at 55 hospitals in 
      Korea. Disease severity scores were defined as: 1) no limitation of daily 
      activities; 2) limitation of daily activities but no need for supplemental oxygen; 
      3) supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula; 4) supplemental oxygen via facial mask; 5) 
      non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 6) invasive mechanical ventilation; 7) 
      multi-organ failure or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy; and 8) death. 
      Recovery was defined as a severity score of 1 or 2, or discharge and release from 
      isolation. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 43 years of age; 43.6% were 
      male. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days. Of the patients 
      with a disease severity score of 3-4 on admission, 65 (71.5%) of the 91 patients 
      recovered, and 7 (7.7%) died due to illness by day 28. Of the patients with disease 
      severity scores of 5-7, 7 (19.5%) of the 36 patients recovered, and 8 (22.2%) died 
      due to illness by day 28. None of the 1,324 patients who were < 50 years of age 
      died; in contrast, the fatality rate due to illness by day 28 was 0.5% (2/375), 0.9% 
      (2/215), 5.8% (6/104), and 14.0% (7/50) for the patients aged 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 
      and â¥ 80 years of age, respectively. CONCLUSION: In Korea, almost all patients of < 
      50 years of age with COVID-19 recovered without supplemental oxygen. In patients of 
      â¥ 50 years of age, the fatality rate increased with age, reaching 14% in patients of 
      â¥ 80 years of age.

AB  - A diagnosis of Brugada pattern in pediatric or adolescent patients is rare. COVID-19 
      is characterized by fevers and a pro-inflammatory state, which may serve as inciting 
      factors for Brugada pattern. Recently described in two adult patients, we report the 
      first case of Brugada pattern in an adolescent with COVID-19.

TI  - An Alert to COVID-19 Literature in Predatory Publishing Venues.
PG  - 102187
LID - 10.1016/j.acalib.2020.102187 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to a flood of papers and preprints, has placed 
      multiple challenges on academic publishing, the most obvious one being sustained 
      integrity under the pressure to publish quickly. There are risks of this high 
      volume-to-speed ratio. Many letters, editorials, and supposedly "peer reviewed" 
      papers in ranked and indexed journals were published in a matter of days, suggesting 
      that peer review was either fleeting or non-existential, or that papers were rapidly 
      approved by editors based on their perceived interest and topicality, rather than on 
      their intrinsic academic value. In academic publishing circles, the claim of "peer 
      review", when in fact it has not been conducted, is a core characteristic of 
      "predatory publishing", and is also a "fake" element that may undermine efforts in 
      recent years to build trust in science's budding serials crisis. While the world is 
      still centrally focused on COVID-19, the issue of "predatory publishing" is being 
      ignored, or not being given sufficient attention. The risks to the scholarly 
      community, academic publishing and ultimately public health are at stake when 
      exploitative and predatory publishing are left unchallenged.

TI  - Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological 
      knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large 
      cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe 
      infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the 
      association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in 
      college students in China was unclear. METHODS: A large cross-sectional online 
      survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's 
      Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 
      Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, 
      respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the 
      association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared 
      with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members 
      and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; 
      PÂ =Â 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; PÂ =Â 0.023) cases in family 
      members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the 
      proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of 
      psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: 
      All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did 
      not evaluate the reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety 
      and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 
      epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.

TI  - Telemedicine in Otolaryngology in the COVID-19 Era: Initial Lessons Learned.
LID - 10.1002/lary.29030 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented global changes in the 
      delivery of healthcare over a short period of time. With the implementation of 
      "shelter in place" orders, otolaryngology clinic visits at our institution were 
      transitioned to Telemedicine. This change enabled the rapid characterization of the 
      patients who accepted and declined Telemedicine. METHODS: Review of 525 
      otolaryngology patients at a tertiary care referral center with scheduled visits 
      requiring rescheduling to a future date or a Telemedicine visit. Visit, demographic 
      information, and reason for deferring Telemedicine were collected for analysis. 
      RESULTS: 72% of patients declined a Telemedicine visit with the most common reason 
      being the lack of a physical exam (97%). There was an even distribution of 
      demographics between those who accepted and declined visits. There was an 
      association between declining Telemedicine with older age (PÂ =â0.0004) and otology 
      visits (PÂ =â0.0003), while facial plastics patients were more likely to accept 
      (PÂ <â0.0001). Patients scheduled earlier during the pandemic were more likely to 
      accept a visit with a median of 28âdays from onset of "shelter in place" orders vs 
      35 for those who declined (PÂ <â0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We describe our initial 
      experience with a transition to Telemedicine, where the majority of patients would 
      decline a virtual visit due to the lack of a physical exam. While the future remains 
      uncertain, Telemedicine will continue to play a vital role in healthcare delivery; 
      we believe that understanding our patient base gives critical insights that will 
      help guide and improve virtual care to meet patient's needs.

AB  - COVID-19 abruptly halted scientific conferences and seminars in mid-March, forcing 
      the scientific community to either postpone or adapt to a virtual format. We caught 
      up with Carla V. Rothlin, Elina I. ZÃºÃ±iga, Hongbo Chi, Rino Rappuoli, and Matthew 
      Krummel to find out about the pros and cons of virtual conferences and seminars and 
      how these could change the nature of scientific conferences. Carla (CVR) and Elina 
      (EIZ) established Global ImmunoTalks in April this year; Hongbo (HC) helped organize 
      the Immunometabolism Mini-Symposia series in May and June; Rino (RR) was one of the 
      scientific organizers of the Transforming Vaccinology Keystone, which moved to a 
      virtual format in June; and Matthew (MK) has been organizing Eco Seminars at the 
      University of California, San Francisco since 2019.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19. 
      Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 64 patients with severe COVID-19 
      admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 12, 2020 to February 28, 2020. 
      There were 36 males and 28 females, aging from 44 to 85 years[median 68 (62, 72)]. 
      Fifty-two patients (81%) had underlying comorbidities. The patients were divided 
      into the death group (n=40) and the survival group (n=24) according to the treatment 
      outcomes. In the death group, 24 were male, and 16 were female, aging from 49 to 85 
      years [median 69 (62, 72)], with 31 cases (78%) complicated with underlying 
      diseases. In the survival group, there were 12 males and 12 females, aging from 44 
      to 82 years[median 66 (61,73)], with 21 cases (88%) with comorbidities. Clinical 
      data of the two groups were collected and compared, including general information, 
      laboratory examinations, imaging features and treatments. For normally distributed 
      data, independent group t test was used; otherwise, Mann Whitney test was used to 
      compare the variables. Ï(2) test and Fisher exact test was used when analyzing 
      categorical variables. Results: The median of creatine kinase isozyme (CK-MB) in the 
      death group was 19.0 (17.0,23.0) U/L, which was higher than that in the survival 
      group 16.5 (13.5,19.6) U/L. The median level of cTnI in the death group was 0.03 
      (0.03, 0.07) Î¼g/L, which was significantly higher than that in the survival group 
      (0.02, 0.03) Î¼g/L, with a statistically significant difference between the two 
      groups (P=0.007). The concentration of myoglobin in the death group was 79.5 (28.7, 
      189.0) Î¼g/L, which was higher than 33.1 (25.7, 54.5) Î¼g/L in the survival group. The 
      level of D-dimer in the death group was 2.0 (0.6, 5.2) mg/L, which was higher than 
      0.7 (0.4, 2.0) mg/L in the survival group. The LDH level of the death group was 
      465.0 (337.5,606.5) U/L, which was higher than that of the survibal group, 341.0 
      (284.0,430.0) U/L, the difference being statistically significant (P=0.006). The 
      concentration of alanine aminotransferase in the death group was 40.0 (30.0, 48.0) 
      U/L, which was higher than 32.5 (24.0, 40.8) U/L in the survival group, and the 
      difference was statistically significant (P=0.047).Abnormal ECG was found in 16 
      cases (62%) in the death group, which was significantly higher than that in the 
      survival group (29%), the difference being statistically significant (P=0.024) .The 
      main causes of death were severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS, n=20), acute heart failure(n=9), atrial fibrillation(n=3) and multiple organ 
      dysfunction syndrome (MODS, n=3). Conclusions: ARDS caused by severe pneumonia and 
      acute heart failure and atrial fibrillation caused by acute viral myocarditis were 
      the main causes of death in severe COVID-19 patients. Early prevention of myocardial 
      injury and treatment of acute viral myocarditis complicated with disease progression 
      may provide insights into treatment and reduction of mortality in patients with 
      severe COVID-19.

AB  - In palliative care, we strive to provide care to the whole patient. When we think 
      about the whole patient, we include the people who are important in our patients' 
      lives. Our New York City-based palliative care team has found that caring for 
      patients' loved ones has proven to be an even more important aspect of the care we 
      have provided during the COVID epidemic. In this article, we describe the 
      multicomponenet interdisciplinary interventions we have implemented to enhance our 
      ability to create a therapeutic alliance with family members and facilitate the 
      provision of goal concordant care to patients with COVID during this extremely 
      difficult time.

TI  - Fast-Food Patronage and Obesity Prevalence during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An 
      Alternative Explanation.
LID - 10.1002/oby.22993 [doi]
AB  - In a study recently published in Obesity, Ashby (1) examined how unhealthy eating, 
      defined as patronage to eating establishments serving unhealthy foods (i.e., fast 
      food ), was associated with adult obesity prevalence, the food environment, and 
      poverty across counties in the United States (U.S.) during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      Ashby found that while patronage to fast food eating establishments declined, 
      counties with greater adult obesity prevalence saw less steep declines.

TI  - Interdisciplinary and Collaborative Approaches Needed to Determine Impact of 
      COVID-19 on Older Adults and Aging: CAG/ACG and CJA/RCV Joint Statement.
PG  - 333-343
LID - 10.1017/S0714980820000203 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent state of public emergency have significantly 
      affected older adults in Canada and worldwide. It is imperative that the 
      gerontological response be efficient and effective. In this statement, the board 
      members of the Canadian Association on Gerontology/L'Association canadienne de 
      gÃ©rontologie (CAG/ACG) and the Canadian Journal on Aging/La revue canadienne du 
      vieillissement (CJA/RCV) acknowledge the contributions of CAG/ACG members and 
      CJA/RCV readers. We also profile the complex ways that COVID-19 is affecting older 
      adults, from individual to population levels, and advocate for the adoption of 
      multidisciplinary collaborative teams to bring together different perspectives, 
      areas of expertise, and methods of evaluation in the COVID-19 response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to 
      the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to 
      evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the 
      general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. METHODS: 
      2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from 
      February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the 
      Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety 
      scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep 
      quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress 
      symptoms (PTSS). RESULTS: The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in 
      quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and 
      educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more 
      avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. 
      Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the 
      following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three 
      subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression 
      indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and 
      Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. LIMITATIONS: 
      This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in 
      quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen. Some demographic and clinical variables 
      were associated with depressive symptoms.

AB  - An issue of the novel coronavirus infection spreading is currently in the first 
      place among others in the list of the international medical community. Due to lack 
      of information, conflicting research findings, multicomponent effect of the virus on 
      the body host, as well as various consequences that the virus triggers in the body, 
      now every medical specialty does study the viral attack pathogenesis. Recent months 
      showed that vascular complications are the most severe in the Coronavirus Disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) and are the main cause of death in the patients. The mechanisms of 
      vascular complications are complex and affect both the hemostatic system and immune 
      responses, "inflammatory storm", disorders of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone 
      system, endotheliopathy, etc. Due to the leading role of vascular complications in 
      the viral infection pathogenesis, several groups of patients are at extra risk, 
      including pregnant women, patients with a burdened obstetric history, with 
      hereditary thrombophilia and antiphospholipid syndrome, and patients after in vitro 
      fertilization (IVF). In this category of pregnant women, use of low-molecular-weight 
      heparins (LMWH) is particularly important for both prevention of vascular and 
      obstetric complications, and for pathogenetic therapy of COVID-19.

TI  - The role of ecosystems in mitigation and management of Covid-19 and other zoonoses.
PG  - 7-17
LID - 10.1016/j.envsci.2020.05.017 [doi]
AB  - There is rising international concern about the zoonotic origins of many global 
      pandemics. Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in 
      pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and 
      environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade 
      ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly 
      tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the 
      natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from 
      animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising 
      measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent 
      human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle 
      tend to convert beneficial ecosystem services into disservices, exacerbating risks 
      related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems 
      constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide 
      for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR 
      (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects 
      of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services 
      and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases; and 
      of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both (2) 
      regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. 
      From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising 
      the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk 
      management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity 
      crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at 
      the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing 
      scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of 
      societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political 
      responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate 
      that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore 
      transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change 
      and the 'biodiversity crisis'. This also highlights the need for concerted global

AB  - The response to the COVID-19 crisis across most research institutions mandated 
      ceasing nonessential research activities in order to minimize the spread of the 
      virus in our communities. With minimal notice, experiments were terminated, cell 
      lines were frozen, mouse colonies were culled, and trainees were prevented from 
      performing bench research. Still, despite the interruption of experimental 
      productivity, the shutdown has proven for many PIs and trainees that doing and 
      thinking science are not activities that are bound to the laboratory. Furthermore, 
      the shutdowns have solidified important emerging trends and forced us to further 
      innovate to get the most out of working remotely. We hope that some of these 
      innovations, hard-gained in this difficult time, will persist and develop into new 
      paradigms-lessons that will improve our science and our relationship to the climate 
      and community beyond the current pandemic.

TI  - Asymptomatic patients with coronavirus disease and cardiac surgery: When should you 
      operate?
LID - 10.1111/jocs.14918 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic and the decision-making process of whether 
      to perform urgent procedures during a surge are issues that will likely not 
      disappear in the near future as reflected by the current rise in COVID cases in the 
      southern and western United States and the resurgent numbers of confirmed cases 
      around that world leading to are leading to new lock-downs. Multi-disciplinary 
      discussions will continue to be important to decide individual risk and benefit 
      profiles for patients with asymptomatic COVID patients moving forward. While 
      imperfect, this most recent study provides more insight to some of the risks that 
      should be weighed in these discussions. Further prospective, longitudinal research 
      and better understanding of the heterogeneity of the COVID positive patient will 
      further enhance understanding the decision-making process in the cardiac surgical 
      patient through these difficult times.

TI  - How to reduce epidemic peaks keeping under control the time-span of the epidemic.
PG  - 109940
LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109940 [doi]
AB  - One of the main challenges of the measures against the COVID-19 epidemic is to 
      reduce the amplitude of the epidemic peak without increasing without control its 
      timescale. We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic 
      dynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak I(P) can be achieved only at the 
      price of increasing the time t(P) of its occurrence and its entire time-span t(E) . 
      By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the equations for the SIR 
      dynamics. This allows us to solve exactly the dynamics in the time domain and to 
      derive the scaling behaviour of the size, the timescale and the speed of the 
      epidemics, by reducing the infection rate Î± and by increasing the removal rate Î² by 
      a factor of Î». We show that for a given value of the size (I(P) , the total, I(E) 
      and average I^P number of infected), its occurrence time t(P) and entire time-span 
      t(E) can be reduced by a factor 1/Î» if the reduction of I is achieved by increasing 
      the removal rate instead of reducing the infection rate. Thus, epidemic containment 
      measures based on tracing, early detection followed by prompt isolation of infected 
      individuals are more efficient than those based on social distancing. We apply our 
      results to the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy. We show that the peak time t(P) 
      and the entire time span t(E) could have been reduced by a factor 0.9Â â¤Â 1/Î»Â â¤Â 0.34 
      with containment measures focused on increasing Î² instead of reducing Î±.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a 
      dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we 
      demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with 
      the epidemic . METHODS: By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such 
      as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, 
      were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. RESULTS: 
      The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87âÂ±â15.79) and 
      (29.27âÂ±â19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive 
      symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, 
      including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine 
      factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction 
      (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099-1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209-2.811), 
      and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252-7.708). Two additional 
      factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on 
      Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609-0.697) and tendency to 
      apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923-0.951). CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial 
      impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and 
      depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children 
      and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific 
      fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant 
      influencing factors.

TI  - Essential Case Management Practices Amidst the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) Crisis: Part 1: Tele-Case Management, Surge Capacity, Discharge Planning, 
      and Transitions of Care.
PG  - 248-266
LID - 10.1097/NCM.0000000000000454 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is the first of a 2-part article that discusses essential case 
      management practices and strategies amidst the novel coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). The series showcases the potential professional case managers have in 
      support of managing during a crisis such as this global pandemic. Part I discusses 
      reenvisioned roles and responsibilities of case managers and leaders known to 
      address patients' needs during a crisis, with a special focus on telehealth, 
      tele-case management, surge capacity, redeployment, discharge planning, and 
      transitions of care. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS: Applicable to the various case 
      management practice settings across the continuum of health and human services, 
      especially acute care. FINDINGS CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 global pandemic crisis has 
      brought an unprecedented challenge to professional case managers and health care 
      professionals. It also has provided opportunities for innovation and partnerships 
      within and across health care organizations and the various care settings where 
      patients/support systems access necessary services. Most importantly, it created a 
      renewed interest in telehealth and facilitated a wider adoption of such approach to 
      care delivery than ever before. This pandemic has also increased the use of 
      nontraditional sites of care, most importantly those that operate virtually on 
      electronic networks and health information system technologies such as remote 
      visits, e-visits, virtual care, and tele-monitoring. Undoubtedly, these have 
      provided new opportunities for tele-case management services and roles for 
      professional case managers in the virtual world of health and human service 
      delivery. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Professional case managers are 
      integral members of interprofessional health care teams. Their roles are even more 
      necessary during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. The practice of case management 
      will forever change-for the better. The experience of this crisis in health care has 
      brought about ever-lasting implications for case management professionals. It has 
      raised awareness to sites of care never were as popular before, resulting in an 
      increased need and recognition for tele-case management practice and virtual case 
      managers. It has also forced partnerships and collaborations among the diverse 
      contexts of health care organizations (public, private, or both) and other 
      industries, regardless of whether directly involved in the delivery of care or 
      having a support service role. These new and innovative approaches in the provision 
      of care and case management services will without a doubt become routine 
      expectations beyond the current pandemic period. Of special note are the enhanced 
      roles of case managers in discharge planning and transitions of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of developing physical/mental 
      health outcomes related to coronavirus syndromes. Nature and frequency of these 
      outcomes are undetermined. METHODS: PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant (PROSPERO-CRD42020180205) 
      systematic review of Web of Science/grey literature until 15th April 2020, to 
      identify studies reporting physical/mental health outcomes in HCW infected/exposed 
      to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS-, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 
      -MERS-, Novel coronavirus -COVID-19-. Proportion random effect meta-analyses, I(2) 
      statistic, quality assessment and sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: 115 articles were 
      included (n=60,458 HCW, age 36.1Â±7.1, 77.1% female). Physical health outcomes: 75.9% 
      HCW infected by SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported fever (95%CI=65.9-83.7%, k=12, n=949), 
      47.9% cough (95%CI=39.2-56.8%, k=14, n=970), 43.6% myalgias (95%CI=31.9-56.0%, k=13, 
      n=898), 42.3% chills (95%CI=20.2-67.9%, k=7, n=716), 41.2% fatigue 
      (95%CI=18.2-68.8%, k=6, n=386), 34.6% headaches (95%CI=23.1-48.2%, k=11, n=893), 
      31.2% dyspnoea (95%CI=23.2-40.5%, k=12, n=1003), 25.3% sore throat 
      (95%CI=18.8-33.2%, k=8, n=747), 22.2% nausea/vomiting (95%CI=14.9-31.8%, k=6, 
      n=662), 18.8% diarrhoea (95%CI=11.9-28.4%, k=9, n=824). Mental health outcomes: 
      62.5% HCW exposed to SARS/MERS/COVID-19 reported general health concerns 
      (95%CI=57.0-67,8%, k=2, n=2254), 43.7% fear (95%CI=33.9-54.0%, k=4, n=584), 37.9% 
      insomnia (95%CI=30.9-45.5%, k=6, n=5067), 37.8% psychological distress 
      (95%CI=28.4-48.2%, k=15, n=24,346), 34.4% burnout (95%CI=19.3-53.5%, k=3, n=1337), 
      29.0% anxiety features (95%CI=14.2-50.3%, k=6, n=9191), 26.3% depressive symptoms 
      (95%CI=12.5-47.1%, k=8, n=9893), 20.7% post-traumatic stress disorder features 
      (95%CI=13.2-31%, k=11, n=3826), 16.1% somatisation (95%CI=0.2-96.0%, k=2, n=2184), 
      14.0% stigmatisation feelings (95%CI=6.4-28.1%, k=2, n=411). LIMITATIONS: Limited 
      amount of evidence for some outcomes and suboptimal design in several studies 
      included. CONCLUSIONS: SARS/MERS/COVID-19 have a substantial impact on the physical 
      and mental health of HCW, which should become a priority for public health 
      strategies.

AB  - : ACE2 receptor has a broad expression pattern in the cellular membrane and provides 
      a protective action against the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, 
      this enzyme has become of extreme interest during the pandemic infection of COVID-19 
      (coronavirus disease 2019). This virus invades alveolar epithelium and 
      cardiomyocytes using ACE2 as a transmembrane receptor. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory 
      peptide that degrades Ang II into Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating the biological 
      effects of the AT1 receptor. The binding between the spike protein of COVID-19 and 
      the enzyme is crucial for the virus to enter the target cells, but whether an 
      increase in ACE2 activity could facilitate the infection is not yet demonstrated. 
      However, this aspect has raised many concerns about the use of ACE inhibitors or 
      ARBs in infected patients or patients at risk of infection. It appears that cellular 
      infection leads to a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increase in the activity of 
      the Ang II--AT1 axis, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
      ARDS, myocarditis, and hypercoagulability with the possibility of exacerbation of 
      acute coronary syndrome, induction of pulmonary embolism, or appearance of 
      disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin 
      receptor blocker drugs should be continued in infected patients, as their 
      discontinuation can increase Ang II activity and induce injury to the lungs or 
      cardiovascular system.

PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2020.1800277 [doi]
AB  - This is a narrative reflection about my experience of the ongoing coronavirus 
      (COVID-19) outbreaks across countries between January and early March 2020. My 
      recalled memories showed the shifting and contingent thoughts and emotions. 
      Contextual factors such as my ethnic identity and local anti-coronavirus policies 
      also constructed my perceptions of the pandemic. While my story is unfinished as the 
      coronavirus outbreak is still happening, the narratives provide a novel perspective 
      to understand public health practices in a global context. As the health knowledge 
      construction is infused with identity and personal meanings, this reflection also 
      shows that people from a racial group may face unfair treatment in a pandemic. My 
      narratives suggest the need for a more globally synchronized health communication in 
      pandemics.

TI  - Assessment of the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on glycaemic control in people 
      with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring.
LID - 10.1111/dme.14374 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe the effect of the stringent lockdown measures, introduced in the UK 
      on 23 March 2020 to curtail the transmission of COVID-19, on glycaemic control in 
      people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. METHODS: We undertook an 
      observational study of 572 individuals with type 1 diabetes for whom paired flash 
      glucose monitoring data were available between early March and May 2020. The primary 
      outcome was change in flash glucose monitoring variables. We also assessed clinical 
      variables associated with change in glycaemic control. RESULTS: Percentage of time 
      in range increased between March and May 2020 [median (interquartile range) 53 
      (41-64)% vs 56 (45-68)%; P < 0.001], with associated improvements in standard 
      deviation of glucose (P <0.001) and estimated HbA(1c) (P <0.001). There was a small 
      reduction in the number of individuals meeting the hypoglycaemia target of <5% per 
      day (64% vs 58%; P = 0.004). Comparing changes in flash glucose monitoring data from 
      March to May in 2019 with the same period in 2020 confirmed that these differences 
      were confined to 2020. Socio-economic deprivation was an independent predictor of a 
      â¥5% reduction in time in range during lockdown (odds ratio 0.45 for people in the 
      two most affluent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles; P <0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown was not associated with a significant deterioration in 
      glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes using flash glucose monitoring. 
      However, socio-economic deprivation appeared to increase the risk of decline in 
      glycaemic control, which has implications for how support is focused in challenging 
      times.

TI  - Sample sizes for surveillance of S. aureus transmission to monitor effectiveness and 
      provide feedback on intraoperative infection control including for COVID-19.
PG  - 100115
LID - 10.1016/j.pcorm.2020.100115 [doi]
AB  - Reductions in perioperative surgical site infections are obtained by a multifaceted 
      approach including patient decolonization, hand hygiene, and hub disinfection, and 
      environmental cleaning. Associated surveillance of S. aureus transmission quantifies 
      the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and 
      clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19). To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive 
      surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. We evaluated appropriate 
      sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. There was absence of serial 
      correlation among observed counts of transmitted isolates within each of several 
      periods (all P â¥.18). Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a 
      pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had 
      observed transmission (all P â¥.23). Most pairs of cases had no detected transmitted 
      isolates. Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site 
      infection (P =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose 
      response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (P 
      =.25). The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare 
      the proportion of pairs of cases with S. aureus transmission to an acceptable 
      threshold. An appropriate sample size for this screening is N =25 pairs. If 
      significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to 
      reduce transmission and infections. Subsequent sampling is done to evaluate 
      effectiveness. The two independent binomial proportions are compared using 
      Boschloo's exact test. The total sample size for the 1(st) and 2(nd) stage is N =100 
      pairs. Because S. aureus transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing 
      what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used 
      (e.g., infections). Only 10/298 combinations of specialty and operating room were 
      relatively common (â¥1.0% of cases) and had expected incidence â¥0.20 infections per 8 
      hours of sampled cases. The 10 combinations encompassed â17% of cases, showing the 
      value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties 
      and rooms. In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample 
      sizes for using S. aureus transmission within and between pairs of successive cases 
      in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention 
      of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.

AB  - Infectious diseases still remain one of the biggest challenges for human health. 
      Accurate and early detection of infectious pathogens are crucial for transmission 
      control, clinical diagnosis, and therapy. For a traditional reason, most 
      immunological and microbiological laboratories are equipped with instruments 
      designated for antibody-based assays in detection of infectious pathogens or 
      clinical diagnosis. Emerging aptamer-based technologies have pushed a shift from 
      antibody-based to aptamer-based assays due to equal specificity, even better 
      sensitivity, lower manufacturing cost and more flexibility in amending for 
      chemiluminescent, electrochemical or fluorescent detection in a multifaceted and 
      high throughput fashion in comparison of aptamer-based to antibody-based assays. The 
      nature of aptamer-based technologies is particularly suitable for point-of-care 
      testing in remote areas at warm or hot atmosphere, and mass screening for potential 
      infection in pandemic of emerging infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 
      in an epicentre or other regions. This review intends to summarize currently 
      available aptamer-based technologies in detection of bacterial, viral, and protozoan 
      pathogens for research and clinical application. It is anticipated that potential 
      technologies will be further optimized and validated for clinical translation in 
      meeting increasing demands for prompt, precise, and reliable detection of specific 
      pathogens in various atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Thoracic Anesthesia of Patients With Suspected or Confirmed 2019 Novel Coronavirus 
      Infection: Preliminary Recommendations for Airway Management by the European 
      Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology Thoracic Subspecialty Committee.

AB  - The novel coronavirus has caused a pandemic around the world. Management of patients 
      with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection who have to undergo thoracic 
      surgery will be a challenge for the anesthesiologists. The thoracic subspecialty 
      committee of European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology (EACTA) has 
      conducted a survey of opinion in order to create recommendations for the anesthetic 
      approach to these challenging patients. It should be emphasized that both the 
      management of the infected patient with COVID-19 and the self-protection of the 
      anesthesia team constitute a complicated challenge. The text focuses therefore on 
      both important topics.

LID - 10.1111/dme.14378 [doi]
AB  - The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial found that 
      dexamethasone 6Â mg once per day for 10Â days reduced deaths by one-third in 
      ventilated patients and by one-fifth in other patients, receiving oxygen therapy. 
      This equates to the prevention of one death in around eight ventilated patients, or 
      one in around 25 patients requiring oxygen.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulted in unprecedented numbers of patients 
      with respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support. The number of patients who 
      required critical care quickly outpaced the availability of intensive care unit 
      (ICU) beds. Consequently, health care systems had to creatively expand critical care 
      services into alternative hospital locations with repurposed staff and equipment. 
      Deploying anesthesia workstations to the ICU to serve as mechanical ventilators 
      requires equipment preparation, multidisciplinary planning, and targeted education. 
      We aim to contextualize this process, highlighting major differences between 
      anesthesia workstations and ICU ventilators, and to share the insights gained from 
      our experiences creating an anesthesia provider-based ventilator management team.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial Spread Relationships of Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic in the 
      World using Self Organizing Maps.

LID - 10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109917 [doi]
AB  - We describe in this paper an analysis of the spatial evolution of coronavirus 
      pandemic around the world by using a particular type of unsupervised neural network, 
      which is called self-organizing maps. Based on the clustering abilities of 
      self-organizing maps we are able to spatially group together countries that are 
      similar according to their coronavirus cases, in this way being able to analyze 
      which countries are behaving similarly and thus can benefit by using similar 
      strategies in dealing with the spread of the virus. Publicly available datasets of 
      coronavirus cases around the globe from the last months have been used in the 
      analysis. Interesting conclusions have been obtained, that could be helpful in 
      deciding the best strategies in dealing with this virus. Most of the previous papers 
      dealing with data of the Coronavirus have viewed the problem on temporal aspect, 
      which is also important, but this is mainly concerned with the forecast of the 
      numeric information. However, we believe that the spatial aspect is also important, 
      so in this view the main contribution of this paper is the use of unsupervised 
      self-organizing maps for grouping together similar countries in their fight against 
      the Coronavirus pandemic, and thus proposing that strategies for similar countries 
      could be established accordingly.

AB  - Although a viral infection is a major triggering factor of asthma and allergic 
      diseases, asthma is suggested to be not a predisposing condition for coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, patients with severe asthma/allergic 
      disease requiring systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents may be at 
      higher risk of more severe clinical course of this infectious disease. For allergic 
      patients who have been followed up at an allergy clinic in our region, it is 
      recommended that they (patients with asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis or chronic 
      urticaria) continue to receive maintenance therapy and be in a well-controlled 
      status. Patients who have used biologics (currently available for targeting type 2 
      inflammation) and allergen immunotherapy should continue the treatment while 
      minimizing hospital and face-to-face visits. It is essential to wear protective 
      equipment for the protection of health care workers as well as patients. We report 
      this consensus to support allergists and clinical immunologists to make optimal 
      decisions under the urgent situation in Asia.

AB  - Some in the medical publishing world have observed an "infodemic" occurring 
      alongside the pandemic. One might define an infodemic as a contagious disease 
      infecting our information culture. As the Editors of A&R, tasked with conducting, 
      reviewing, reporting, and translating science to the rheumatic disease community, we 
      agree with this diagnosis. Herein, we reflect on how the pandemic has impacted A&R, 
      the medical publishing world, and how we may best engage our community to navigate 
      current challenges.

TI  - Digital technology for management of severe mental disorders in low-income and 
      middle-income countries.
PG  - 501-507
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000626 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasingly, digital technologies, especially mobile 
      telecommunications and smartphone apps, are seen as a novel tool for managing severe 
      mental disorders (SMDs) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, 
      there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to 
      effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this 
      review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and 
      support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to 
      advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies 
      evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs 
      are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to 
      yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include 
      improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, 
      and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY: Continued rigorous research evaluating 
      effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, 
      and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs 
      is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric 
      care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the 
      coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research 
      should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with 
      target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital 
      mental health interventions.

TI  - A decade of the sharing economy: Concepts, users, business and governance 
      perspectives.
PG  - 122215
LID - 10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122215 [doi]
AB  - Sharing economy platforms have been transforming production and consumption systems 
      in cities around the world. While the sharing economy may contribute to addressing 
      sustainability issues, its actual economic, social and environmental impacts remain 
      poorly understood. Advancing more sustainably promising forms of sharing and 
      leveraging its benefits, while circumventing its pitfalls, is becoming increasingly 
      important in the era of Covid-19 and climate crisis, economic downturn and 
      uncertainty, and loss of social connectedness, particularly in anonymous urban 
      environments. The ways to capitalise on strengths of the sharing economy are still 
      poorly understood. In particular, the roles and perspectives of users, businesses 
      and municipal governments in institutionalising the sharing economy in various 
      geographical contexts are essential to examine. This volume seeks to advance the 
      research field by focusing on four research areas: 1) understanding the sharing 
      economy conceptually; 2) user perspectives on the sharing economy; 3) business 
      perspective on the sharing economy; and 4) urban governance perspective on the 
      sharing economy. The twenty articles in this volume discuss sustainability 
      implications of the sharing economy from different perspectives, in various 
      geographical contexts, and drawing on a range of disciplines. The volume makes a 
      significant contribution by bringing in empirical findings from emerging and

TI  - Restructuring Electrophysiology During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Practical Guide From 
      a New York City Hospital Network.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is a global pandemic of a novel infectious 
      disease with far-ranging public health implications. With regard to cardiac 
      electrophysiology (EP) services, we discuss the "real-world" challenges and 
      solutions that have been essential for efficient and successful (1) ramping down of 
      standard clinical practice patterns and (2) pivoting of workflow processes to meet 
      the demands of this pandemic. The aims of these recommendations are to outline: (1) 
      essential practical steps to approaching procedures, as well as outpatient and 
      inpatient care of EP patients, with relevant examples, (2) successful strategies to 
      minimize exposure risk to patients and clinical staff while also balancing resource 
      utilization, (3) challenges related to redeployment and restructuring of clinical 
      and support staff, and (4) considerations regarding continued collaboration with 
      clinical and administrative colleagues to implement these changes. While process 
      changes will vary across practices and hospital systems, we believe that these 
      experiences from 4 different EP sections in a large New York City hospital network 
      currently based in the global epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic 
      will prove useful for other EP practices adapting their own practices in preparation 
      for local surges.

TI  - EML webinar overview: Simulation-assisted discovery of membrane targeting 
      nanomedicine.
PG  - 100817
LID - 10.1016/j.eml.2020.100817 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious diseases again to the forefront of 
      global public health concerns. In this EML webinar (Gao, 2020), we discuss some 
      recent work on simulation-assisted discovery of membrane targeting nanomedicine to 
      counter increasing antimicrobial resistance and potential application of similar 
      ideas to the current pandemic. A recent report led by the world health organization 
      (WHO) warned that 10 million people worldwide could die of bacterial infections each 
      year by 2050. To avert the crisis, membrane targeting antibiotics are drawing 
      increasing attention due to their intrinsic advantage of low resistance development. 
      In collaboration with a number of experimental groups, we show examples of 
      simulation-assisted discovery of molecular agents capable of selectively penetrating 
      and aggregating in bacterial lipid membranes, causing membrane permeability/rupture. 
      Through systematic all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy analysis, 
      we demonstrate that the membrane activity of the molecular agents correlates with 
      their ability to enter, perturb and permeabilize the lipid bilayers. Further study 
      on different cell membranes demonstrates that the selectivity results from the 
      presence of cholesterol in mammalian but not in bacterial membranes, as the 
      cholesterol can condense the hydrophobic region of membrane, preventing the 
      penetration of the molecular agents. Following the molecular penetration, we 
      establish a continuum theory and derive the energetic driving force for the domain 
      aggregation and pore growth on lipid membrane. We show that the energy barrier to 
      membrane pore formation can be significantly lowered through molecular aggregation 
      on a large domain with intrinsic curvature and a sharp interface. The theory is 
      consistent with experimental observations and validated with coarse-grained 
      molecular dynamics simulations of molecular domain aggregation leading to pore 
      formation in a lipid membrane. The mechanistic modelling and simulation provide some 
      fundamental principles on how molecular antimicrobials interact with bacterial 
      membranes and damage them through domain aggregation and pore formation. For 
      treating viral infections and cancer therapy, we discuss potential size- and 
      lipid-type-based selectivity principles for developing membrane active nanomedicine. 
      These studies suggest a general simulation-assisted platform to accelerate discovery 
      and innovation in nanomedicine against infectious diseases. EML Webinar speakers are

      current: An additional but distinctive target.

AB  - Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent 
      tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been 
      launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this 
      drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure 
      to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation 
      current (I(h)) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of 
      the current in pituitary GH(3) cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or 
      zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I(h) amplitude further. The 
      presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I(h) activation curve without 
      changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction 
      in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular 
      (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor 
      erg-mediated K(+) current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential 
      recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was 
      accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by 
      hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD 
      is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional 
      impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.

TI  - Bat SARS-Like WIV1 coronavirus uses the ACE2 of multiple animal species as receptor 
      and evades IFITM3 restriction via TMPRSS2 activation of membrane fusion.
PG  - 1567-1579
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2020.1787797 [doi]
AB  - Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats and other 
      animal species. Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin 
      converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether 
      these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor 
      remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 
      orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human 
      ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped 
      virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of 
      wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 
      could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, 
      WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 
      restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the 
      infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. 
      Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs 
      and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by 
      SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).

      Using Click Chemistry.

AB  - The reliable detection of transcription events through the quantification of the 
      corresponding mRNA is of paramount importance for the diagnostics of infections and 
      diseases. The quantification and localization analysis of the transcripts of a 
      particular gene allows disease states to be characterized more directly compared to 
      an analysis on the transcriptome wide level. This is particularly needed for the 
      early detection of virus infections as now required for emergent viral diseases, e. 
      g. Covid-19. In situ mRNA analysis, however, is a formidable challenge and currently 
      performed with sets of single-fluorophore-containing oligonucleotide probes that 
      hybridize to the mRNA in question. Often a large number of probe strands (>30) are 
      required to get a reliable signal. The more oligonucleotide probes are used, 
      however, the higher the potential off-target binding effects that create background 
      noise. Here, we used click chemistry and alkyne-modified DNA oligonucleotides to 
      prepare multiple-fluorophore-containing probes. We found that these multiple-dye 
      probes allow reliable detection and direct visualization of mRNA with only a very 
      small number (5-10) of probe strands. The new method enabled the inâsitu detection 
      of viral transcripts as early as 4 hours after infection.

AB  - â¢ Rapid development of COVID-19 has altered healthcare and services around the 
      world; changes have affected women, newborn infants, families, and staff. â¢ 
      Restrictive practices have been introduced in maternal and newborn care that limit 
      women's decisions and rights of women and newborn infants, including restrictions on 
      the place of birth, continuity of care, and mother-baby contact. â¢ An 
      evidence-informed approach is now developing in some countries in which essential 
      elements of quality can be maintained while also protecting and supporting staff. â¢ 
      To keep women, newborn infants, families, and staff safe, balance is needed between 
      the public health, quality care, and human rights agendas. â¢ A set of key principles 
      is proposed to inform COVID-relevant quality care and service provision. â¢ A 
      pro-active strategy to inform longer-term planning for life during and after the 
      pandemic should be grounded in evidence and co-created with women, families, and 
      staff.
